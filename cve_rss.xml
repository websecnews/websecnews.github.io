While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed.

The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the "specific" or the "reflect" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. ("generic" model is not impacted)

Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property "org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:31:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22886 | distributeddatamgr_udmf has a memory leak vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22886</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker case DOS through missing release of memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25052 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has a buffer overflow vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25052</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker cause DOS through buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27132 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27132</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker arbitrary code execution in pre-installed apps through out-of-bounds write.

Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 01:15:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4303 | PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System add-phlebotomist.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4303</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System 1.0.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 20:00:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1909 | BuddyBoss Platform Pro &amp;lt;= 2.7.01 - Authentication Bypass via Apple OAuth provider</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1909</link><description>The BuddyBoss Platform Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.7.01.

Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 19:38:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46731 | Craft CMS Contains a Potential Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via Twig SSTI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46731</link><description>Craft is a content management system.

Prior to version 0.6.6, a vulnerability in the way certain html tags in chat messages are rendered allows attackers to inject JavaScript code into a chat transcript. The JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser every time that chat transcript is opened, allowing attackers to retrieve the user's access token and gain full control over their account. Chat transcripts can be shared with other users in the same server, or with the whole open-webui community if "Enable Community Sharing" is enabled in the admin panel. If this exploit is used against an admin user, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server where the open-webui backend is hosted. This can be done by creating a new function which contains malicious python code. This vulnerability also affects chat transcripts uploaded to `https://openwebui.com/c//`, allowing for wormable stored XSS in https[:]//openwebui[.]com. Version 0.6.6 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:57:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46720 | Keystone has an unintended `isFilterable` bypass that can be used as an oracle to match hidden fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46720</link><description>Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42212 | HCL BigFix Compliance is affected by an improper or missing SameSite attribute</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42212</link><description>HCL BigFix Compliance is affected by an improper or missing SameSite attribute.

Prior to version 0.6.6, low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id, which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's browser. Under the default settings, files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed by admins or themselves, limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file can be sent to an admin, and if clicked, will give the low-privileged user complete control over the admin's account, ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46340 | Misskey CSS Style Injection Vulnerability In `MkUrlPreview`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46340</link><description>Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:50:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46553 | @misskey-dev/summaly Redirect Filter Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46553</link><description>@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page.

Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:50:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4283 | SourceCodester/oretnom23 Stock Management System Login.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4283</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester/oretnom23 Stock Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) &gt; (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58100 | bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   --&gt;    bpf_prog_is_offloaded
      bpf_prog_is_offloaded           check_cfg
      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env-&gt;ops
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_btf_trace
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_name
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_proto
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;dst_trampoline
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;mod
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_attach_type
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_prog_type
- prog-&gt;expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58237 | bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58237</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers

Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate
packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call
invalidates packet pointers.

Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes
use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for
global sub-programs, such that the following program could be
rejected:

    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	bpf_tail_call_static(sk, &amp;amp;jmp_table, 0);
    	return 0;
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
    	... make p valid ...
    	tail_call(sk);
    	*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */
    	...
    }

The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that
can invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with
tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4316 | Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests eve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4316</link><description>Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests even if disallowed by the configured policy via specific user interface actions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 14:13:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45751 | SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullnam...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45751</link><description>SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullname text field.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 13:49:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28168 | Outsystems Multiple File Upload &lt; 3.1.0 is vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload.
