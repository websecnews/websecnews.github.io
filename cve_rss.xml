A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller &gt;= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 01:22:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6560 | Kernel: io_uring out of boundary memory access in __io_uaddr_map()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6560</link><description>An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the io_uring SQ/CQ rings functionality in the Linux kernel.

This has been recently changed to use the regular expression `^https?://`, however this regular expression can be bypassed by an absolute URL with leading whitespace. For example `\nhttps://whatever.com` which has a leading newline. According to the fetch specification, before a fetch is made the URL is normalized. "To normalize a byte sequence potentialValue, remove any leading and trailing HTTP whitespace bytes from potentialValue.". This means the final request will be normalized to `https://whatever.com` bypassing the check and nuxt-api-party will send a request outside of the whitelist. This could allow us to leak credentials or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should revert to the previous method of detecting absolute URLs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 23:50:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49800 | Denial of service by abusing `fetchOptions.retry` in nuxt-api-party</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49800</link><description>`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 23:50:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49798 | Duplicated execution of subcalls in OpenZeppelin Contracts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49798</link><description>OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. A merge issue when porting the 5.0.1 patch to the 4.9 branch caused a line duplication. In the version of `Multicall.sol` released in `@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.4` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@4.9.4`, all subcalls are executed twice. Concretely, this exposes a user to unintentionally duplicate operations like asset transfers. The duplicated delegatecall was removed in version 4.9.5. The 4.9.4 version is marked as deprecated. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 23:50:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6337 | Vault May be Vulnerable to a Denial of Service Through Memory Exhaustion When Handling Large HTTP Requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6337</link><description>HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.12.0 and newer are vulnerable to a denial of service through memory exhaustion of the host when handling large unauthenticated and authenticated HTTP requests from a client.

Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 20:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49782 | Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in error message passing in richdocumentscode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49782</link><description>Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology.

parsing a specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example,
 if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop.


Canisters using affected versions of candid
 are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run 
indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum 
instruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload 
will result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters written in Motoko are unaffected.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:37:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49443 | DoraCMS v2.1.8 was discovered to re-use the same code for verification of valid usernames and passwords.

By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones.

are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or
possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to
different and unrelated sites and domains.

It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that
verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For
example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower
case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 01:53:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6566 | Business Logic Errors in microweber/microweber</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6566</link><description>Business Logic Errors in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:53:47 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
