CrowdStrike has identified a validation logic error in the Falcon sensor for Linux, Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and Falcon Container Sensor where our TLS connection routine to the CrowdStrike cloud can incorrectly process server certificate validation. This could allow an attacker with the ability to control network traffic to potentially conduct a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. CrowdStrike identified this issue internally and released a security fix in all Falcon sensor for Linux, Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and Falcon Container Sensor versions 7.06 and above.

 
CrowdStrike identified this issue through our longstanding, rigorous security review process, which has been continually strengthened with deeper source code analysis and ongoing program enhancements as part of our commitment to security resilience. CrowdStrike has no indication of any exploitation of this issue in the wild. CrowdStrike has leveraged its world class threat hunting and intelligence capabilities to actively monitor for signs of abuse or usage of this flaw and will continue to do so.

For release 1.8.0, and test releases with PIV enabled prior to 1.8.0, the PIV application could accept invalid keys for authentication of the admin key. This could lead to compromise of the integrity of the data stored in the application. An attacker without access to the proper administration key would be able to generate new keys and overwrite certificates. Such an attacker would not be able to read-out or extract existing private data, nor would they be able to gain access to cryptographic operations that would normally require PIN-based authentication. The issue is fixed in piv-authenticator 0.3.9, and in Nitrokey's firmware 1.8.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 18:36:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25205 | Remote Authentication-Bypass can lead to server crash or limited information disclosure due to faulty pattern matching</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25205</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.

This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 18:36:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1214 | pihome-shc PiHome Role-Based Access Control user_accounts.php authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1214</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in pihome-shc PiHome 2.0.

Prior to versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.11, Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via Rack::Auth::Basic, if success, the username will be put in env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files.

Revert "libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir"

The current directory offset allocator (based on mtree_alloc_cyclic)
stores the next offset value to return in octx-&gt;next_offset. This
mechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over
time. Eventually, though, the newly allocated offset value wraps
back to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller than other already-
allocated offset values.

Yu Kuai  reports that, after commit 64a7ce76fb90
("libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir"), if a
directory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer
visible via readdir/getdents because offset_readdir() stops listing
entries once an entry's offset is larger than octx-&gt;next_offset.
These entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will
never again appear in readdir(3) output.

The reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as
monotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies,
and introduces this comparison:

	if (dentry2offset(dentry) &gt;= last_index) {

On 64-bit platforms, the directory offset value upper bound is
2^63 - 1. Directory offsets will monotonically increase for millions
of years without wrapping.

On 32-bit platforms, however, LONG_MAX is 2^31 - 1. The allocator
can wrap after only a few weeks (at worst).

Revert commit 64a7ce76fb90 ("libfs: fix infinite directory reads for
offset dir") to prepare for a fix that can work properly on 32-bit
systems and might apply to recent LTS kernels where shmem employs
the simple_offset mechanism.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21698 | Revert &amp;quot;usb: gadget: u_serial: Disable ep before setting port to null to fix the crash caused by port being null&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21698</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

buffer heads or iomap_folio_state structs, and we cannot mix the two.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57951 | hrtimers: Handle CPU state correctly on hotplug</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57951</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hrtimers: Handle CPU state correctly on hotplug

Consider a scenario where a CPU transitions from CPUHP_ONLINE to halfway
through a CPU hotunplug down to CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE, and then back to
CPUHP_ONLINE:

Since hrtimers_prepare_cpu() does not run, cpu_base.hres_active remains set
to 1 throughout. However, during a CPU unplug operation, the tick and the
clockevents are shut down at CPUHP_AP_TICK_DYING. On return to the online
state, for instance CFS incorrectly assumes that the hrtick is already
active, and the chance of the clockevent device to transition to oneshot
mode is also lost forever for the CPU, unless it goes back to a lower state
than CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE once.

This round-trip reveals another issue; cpu_base.online is not set to 1
after the transition, which appears as a WARN_ON_ONCE in enqueue_hrtimer().

Aside of that, the bulk of the per CPU state is not reset either, which
means there are dangling pointers in the worst case.

Address this by adding a corresponding startup() callback, which resets the
stale per CPU state and sets the online flag.

[ tglx: Make the new callback unconditionally available, remove the online
  	modification in the prepare() callback and clear the remaining
  	state in the starting callback instead of the prepare callback ]</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:39:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1200 | SourceCodester Best Church Management Software slider_crud.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1200</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Best Church Management Software 1.1.

fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)

Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 ("fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore") the
number of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but
they still happen sometimes.

In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is
not just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU
freeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.

The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural
sleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write to
happen, but apparently that is not always enough.

Add a cond_resched() to the second loop in __read_vmcore to (hopefully)
get rid of the softlockups.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:39:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21695 | platform/x86: dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21695</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev race

The dell_uart_bl_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev-&gt;ops is valid when
SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
devm_serdev_device_open().

Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()
calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:39:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21696 | mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21696</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()

When mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd as
write-protected but without UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP, an inconsistency in
flag clearing leads to a mismatch between the vma flags (which have
uffd-wp cleared) and the pte/pmd flags (which do not have uffd-wp
cleared).  This mismatch causes a subsequent mprotect(PROT_WRITE) to
trigger a warning in page_table_check_pte_flags() due to setting the pte
to writable while uffd-wp is still set.

Fix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on any
such mremap() so that the values are consistent with the existing clearing
of VM_UFFD_WP.  Be careful to clear the logical flag regardless of its
physical form; a PTE bit, a swap PTE bit, or a PTE marker.  Cover PTE,
huge PMD and hugetlb paths.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:39:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21697 | drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL after job completion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21697</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This resulted in information contained within the `update response` field not having Data Converter transformations (e.g. encryption) applied. This is an issue only when using the UpdateWorkflowExecution APIs (released on 13th January 2025)  with a proxy leveraging the api-go library before version 1.44.1.

Other data fields were correctly sent to Data Converter. This issue does not impact the Data Converter server. Data was encrypted in transit.

 The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of directory paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a target file on a specific path. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, the exploit could lead to a denial of service condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31345 | Improper input validation in the SMM handler may allow a privileged attacker to overwrite SMRAM, potentially leading to arbitrary code execu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31345</link><description>Improper input validation in the SMM handler may allow a privileged attacker to overwrite SMRAM, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:53:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0112 | NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin™ and NVIDIA IGX Orin software contain a vulnerability where an attacker can cause an improper input validation issue ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0112</link><description>NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin™ and NVIDIA IGX Orin software contain a vulnerability where an attacker can cause an improper input validation issue by escalating certain permissions to a limited degree.

Applications which have been bootstrapped by the igniter installer present since AshAuthentication v4.1.0 and who have used the magic link strategy _or_ are manually revoking tokens are affected by revoked tokens being allowed to verify as valid. Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application, then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire. With that said, magic link tokens are only valid for 10 minutes, so the surface area for abuse is extremely low here. The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise, one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround, delete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in the token resource. This will cause it to use the one internal to Ash Authentication which has always been correct. Alternatively, manually make the changes that are included in the patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:41:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21179 | DHCP Client Service Denial

expected</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12797</link><description>Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24976 | Distribution&amp;#x27;s token authentication allows attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JWT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24976</link><description>Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content. Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue without patching if the system requires token authentication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:56:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24973 | Concorde not removing authentication tokens after logging out</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24973</link><description>Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform Misskey. Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process, authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out, which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in on a shared device should go to Settings &gt; Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version 12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after logging out.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:49:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24900 | Concorde CSRF vulnerability due to insecure configuration of authentication cookie attributes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24900</link><description>Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform Misskey. Due to a lack of CSRF countermeasures and improper settings of cookies for MediaProxy authentication, there is a vulnerability that allows MediaProxy authentication to be bypassed. In versions prior to 12.25Q1.1, the authentication cookie does not have the SameSite attribute. This allows an attacker to bypass MediaProxy authentication and load any image without restrictions under certain circumstances. In versions prior to 12.24Q2.3, this cookie was also used to authenticate the job queue management page (bull-board), so bull-board authentication is also bypassed. This may enable attacks that have a significant impact on availability and integrity.
The affected versions are too old to be covered by this advisory, but the maintainers of Concorde strongly recommend not using older versions. Version 12.25Q1.1 contains a patch. There is no effective workaround other than updating.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:42:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13813 | Insufficient permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.8R1 allows a local authenticated attacker to delete arbitrary file...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13813</link><description>Insufficient permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.8R1 allows a local authenticated attacker to delete arbitrary files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:42:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13842 | A hardcoded key in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.3 allows a local authenticat...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13842</link><description>A hardcoded key in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.3 allows a local authenticated attacker with admin privileges to read sensitive data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:42:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13843 | Cleartext storage of information in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.6 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.3 allows a ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13843</link><description>Cleartext storage of information in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.6 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.3 allows a local authenticated attacker with admin privileges to read sensitive data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:42:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24807 | Fast DDS does not verify Permissions CA</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24807</link><description>eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group).

The script reflects user input from the `jobid` parameter in its HTTP response without proper HTML encoding or sanitization. When a victim visits a specially crafted URL pointing to this endpoint, arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed in their browser context. The vulnerability occurs because the CGI script directly outputs the query string parameters into the HTML response without escaping HTML special characters.

The ZOO-Project Web Processing Service (WPS) Server contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in its EchoProcess service prior to commit 7a5ae1a. The vulnerability exists because the EchoProcess service directly reflects user input in its output without proper sanitization when handling complex inputs.The service accepts various input formats including XML, JSON, and SVG, and returns the content based on the requested MIME type. When processing SVG content and returning it with the image/svg+xml MIME type, the server fails to sanitize potentially malicious JavaScript in attributes like onload, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it exists in a service specifically designed to echo back user input, and the lack of proper sanitization in combination with SVG handling creates a reliable XSS vector.

This can lead to multiple security issues including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are '/v1/share/{id:str}' for uploading and '/v1/share/{id:str}' for downloading JSON files. The lack of authentication allows any user to upload and overwrite files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts, and accessing sensitive information.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 18:53:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13059 | Path Traversal in mintplex-labs/anything-llm</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13059</link><description>A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library.

A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:42:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1151 | GNU Binutils ld xmemdup.c xmemdup memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1151</link><description>A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43.

When IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring

accounting, the accounting can go wrong:
If uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory
counters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned
memory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of
uring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21687 | vfio/platform: check the bounds of read/write syscalls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21687</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 ("drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion"), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport &gt; serial-&gt;num_ports) {
               dev_err(&amp;amp;port-&gt;dev,
                       "%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial-&gt;port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial-&gt;num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial-&gt;num_ports, the assignment of "port" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv-&gt;current_port = newport;
       port = serial-&gt;port[serial_priv-&gt;current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial-&gt;num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21690 | scsi: storvsc: Ratelimit warning logs to prevent VM denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21690</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachestat: fix page cache statistics permission checking

When the 'cachestat()' system call was added in commit cf264e1329fb
("cachestat: implement cachestat syscall"), it was meant to be a much
more convenient (and performant) version of mincore() that didn't need
mapping things into the user virtual address space in order to work.

But it ended up missing the "check for writability or ownership" fix for
mincore(), done in commit 134fca9063ad ("mm/mincore.c: make mincore()
more conservative").

This just adds equivalent logic to 'cachestat()', modified for the file

mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug

In zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the
current CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used
throughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,
it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.

If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,
we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx
are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. 
acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).

The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec ("mm/zswap: move to use
crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration") when the switch to the
crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was
retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the
CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the
crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.

Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating
and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure
that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the
compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after
acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new
CPU.

The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug
callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is
allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU
hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by
compression/decompression.

Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This
would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already
holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a
deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but
Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug
notifiers [2].

Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:
- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in
  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in
  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the
  CPU is onlined.
- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but
  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could
  result in subtle performance issues.

Starting in version 0.3.2 and prior to versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, and 0.5.6, there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion in `net-imap`'s response parser.  At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send  can send highly compressed `uid-set` data which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to convert the `uid-set` data into arrays of integers, with no limitation on the expanded size of the ranges. Versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, 0.5.6, and higher fix this issue. Additional details for proper configuration of fixed versions and backward compatibility are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24032 | PAM-PKCS#11 vulnerable to authentication bypass with default value for `cert_policy` (`none`)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24032</link><description>PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24892 | OpenProject stored HTML injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24892</link><description>OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software.

In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:47:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11831 | Npm-serialize-javascript: cross-site scripting (xss) in serialize-javascript</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11831</link><description>A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript.
