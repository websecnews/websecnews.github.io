Versions 1.2.26 through 1.2.44 have a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in the `name` parameter of the `http://localhost/?controller=ProjectCreationController&amp;amp;action=create` form. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Note that the default content security policy (CSP) blocks the JavaScript attack, though it can be exploited if an instance is badly configured and the software is vulnerable to CSS injection because of the unsafe-inline on the default CSP. Version 1.2.45 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 23:18:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24111 | A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved state management.

Due to the ordering of code used to start an MCP server container, versions of ToolHive prior to 0.0.33 inadvertently store secrets in the run config files which are used to restart stopped containers. This means that an attacker who has access to the home folder of the user who starts the MCP server can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself. This only applies to secrets which were used in containers whose run configs exist at a point in time - other secrets remaining inaccessible. ToolHive 0.0.33 fixes the issue. Some workarounds are available. Stop and delete any running MCP servers, or manually remove any runconfigs from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/toolhive/runconfigs/` (macOS) or `$HOME/.state/toolhive/runconfigs/` (Linux).</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:25:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56523 | Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by placing random data in ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56523</link><description>Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by placing random data in the HTTP request body when using the HTTP GET method.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56524 | Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by adding a special charac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56524</link><description>Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by adding a special character to the request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46717 | sudo-rs Allows Low Privilege Users to Discover the Existence of Files in Inaccessible Folders</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46717</link><description>sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory.

The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:53:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32390 | EspoCRM vulnerable to HTML Injection into phishing, which may lead to account takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32390</link><description>EspoCRM is a free, open-source customer relationship management platform. Prior to version 9.0.8, HTML Injection in Knowledge Base (KB) articles leads to complete page defacement imitating the login page. Authenticated users with the read knowledge article privilege can browse to the KB article and if they submit their credentials, they get captured in plain text. The vulnerability is allowed by overly permissive HTML editing being allowed on the KB articles. Any authenticated user with the privilege to read KB articles is impacted. In an enterprise with multiple applications, the malicious KB article could be edited to match the login pages of other applications, which would make it useful for credential harvesting against other applications as well. Version 9.0.8 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:43:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46729 | phpDVDProfiler Cross-site Scripting vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46729</link><description>julmud/phpDVDProfiler is an adoption of the defunct phpDVDProfiler project, which allows users to display on the web their DVD collections maintained with Invelos's DVDProfiler software.
