Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.

This vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn't have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34713 | sshproxy vulnerable to SSH option injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34713</link><description>sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on the gateway to an internal host via SSH.

When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no".

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1. Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 13:58:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1914 | An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could cause the robot to stop, make the robot controller inaccessible.

When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.

The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.

It is possible for users to be considered as the requester of a specific wiki request if their local user ID on any wiki in a wiki farm matches the local ID of the requester at the wiki where the wiki request was made. This allows them to go to that request entry's on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where their local user ID matches and take any actions that the wiki requester is allowed to take from there.

Commit 02e0f298f8d35155c39aa74193cb7b867432c5b8 fixes the issue. Important note about the fix: This vulnerability has been fixed by disabling access to the REST API and special pages outside of the wiki configured as the "global wiki" in `$wgCreateWikiGlobalWiki` in a user's MediaWiki settings.

As a workaround, it is possible to disable the special pages outside of one's own global wiki by doing something similar to `miraheze/mw-config` commit e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc that is adapted to one's own setup. As for the REST API, before the fix, there wasn't any REST endpoint that allowed one to make writes. Regardless, it is possible to also disable it outside of the global wiki by using `$wgCreateWikiDisableRESTAPI` and `$wgConf` in the configuration for one's own wiki farm..</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 16:09:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34698 | Prototype Pollution in getQueryParam Function (URL Query Parser)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34698</link><description>FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values, which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 16:09:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-18305 | Extreme Networks EXOS before v.22.7 and before v.30.2 was discovered to contain an issue in its Web GUI which fails to restrict URL access, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-18305</link><description>Extreme Networks EXOS before v.22.7 and before v.30.2 was discovered to contain an issue in its Web GUI which fails to restrict URL access, allowing attackers to access sensitive information or escalate privileges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33250 | An issue in Open-Source Technology Committee SRS real-time video server RS/4.0.268(Leo) and SRS/4.0.195(Leo) allows a remote attacker to exe...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33250</link><description>An issue in Open-Source Technology Committee SRS real-time video server RS/4.0.268(Leo) and SRS/4.0.195(Leo) allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34081 | MantisBT Cross-site Scripting vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34081</link><description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.

In Matrix, the server-side *key backup* stores encrypted copies of Matrix message keys. This facilitates key sharing between a user's devices and provides a redundant copy in case all devices are lost. The key backup uses asymmetric cryptography, with each server-side key backup assigned a unique public-private key pair. Due to a logic bug introduced in commit 71136e44c03c79f80d6d1a2446673bc4d53a2067, the Matrix Rust SDK version 0.7.0 will sometimes log the private part of the backup key pair to Rust debug logs (using the `tracing` crate). This issue has been resolved in the Matrix Rust SDK version 0.7.1.

A stored HTML Injection vulnerability has been identified in the Email Receival Module of the Freescout Application. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTML content into emails sent to the application's mailbox. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTML content within incoming emails, allowing attackers to embed malicious HTML code in the context of the application's domain. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML content into emails. This could lead to various attacks such as form hijacking, application defacement, or data exfiltration via CSS injection. Although unauthenticated attackers are limited to HTML injection, the consequences can still be severe. Version 1.8.139 implements strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that any HTML content received via emails is properly sanitized to prevent malicious HTML injections.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34080 | MantisBT Vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34080</link><description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.

Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:42:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34340 | Authentication Bypass when using using older password hashes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34340</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.

GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:59:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25641 | Cacti RCE vulnerability when importing packages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25641</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.

Bluetooth: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by sco_sock_timeout

When the sco connection is established and then, the sco socket
is releasing, timeout_work will be scheduled to judge whether
the sco disconnection is timeout. The sock will be deallocated
later, but it is dereferenced again in sco_sock_timeout. As a
result, the use-after-free bugs will happen. The root cause is
shown below:

    Cleanup Thread               |      Worker Thread
sco_sock_release                 |
  sco_sock_close                 |
    __sco_sock_close             |
      sco_sock_set_timer         |

    sock_put(sk) //FREE          |  sco_sock_timeout
                                 |    sock_hold(sk) //USE

Bluetooth: l2cap: fix null-ptr-deref in l2cap_chan_timeout

There is a race condition between l2cap_chan_timeout() and
l2cap_chan_del(). When we use l2cap_chan_del() to delete the
channel, the chan-&gt;conn will be set to null. But the conn could
be dereferenced again in the mutex_lock() of l2cap_chan_timeout().
As a result the null pointer dereference bug will happen. The

This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move
on same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old
location is simply not available any more.

Some fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the move
notification before actually moving things because only this way we have
the correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.

Also rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the eviction
counter before the move.

usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit

If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()
as length will wrap around ending up as some very
large value.

The driver will then proceed to parse the header
located at that position, which will either oops or
process some random value.

The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
since the introduction of the driver.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35167 | WordPress Envo&amp;#x27;s Elementor Templates &amp;amp; Widgets for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;=1.4.8 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35167</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in EnvoThemes Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.4.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35169 | WordPress All Bootstrap Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.15 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35169</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in AREOI All Bootstrap Blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects All Bootstrap Blocks: from n/a through 1.3.15.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4067 | Regular Expression Denial of Service in micromatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4067</link><description>The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4068 | Memory Exhaustion in braces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4068</link><description>The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion.
