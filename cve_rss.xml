The issue comes from an improper implementation of the C. rule of section 5.2.4 of RFC3986 and is fixed in Vert.x Core component (used by Vert.x Web):  https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5895 



Steps to reproduce
Given a file served by the static handler, craft an URI that introduces a string like bar%2F..%2F after the last / char to deny the access to the URI with an HTTP 404 response. For example https://example.com/foo/index.html can be denied with https://example.com/foo/bar%2F..%2Findex.html

Mitgation
Disabling Static Handler cache fixes the issue.

By default, the DHCP relay agent inserts its own Option 82 information when forwarding client requests, optionally replacing any Option 82 information provided by the client. When a specific DHCP DISCOVER is received in 'forward-only' mode with Option 82, the device should drop the message unless 'trust-option82' is configured. Instead, the DHCP relay forwards these packets to the DHCP server unmodified, which uses up addresses in the DHCP server's address pool, ultimately leading to address pool exhaustion.

When an ICMP packet is received with a specifically malformed IP header value, the FPC receiving the packet crashes and restarts. Due to the specific type of malformed packet, adjacent upstream routers would not forward the packet, limiting the attack surface to adjacent networks.

This issue only affects ICMPv4. ICMPv6 is not vulnerable to this issue.

Because any authenticated user (not limited to administrators) can create projects through the API, an attacker can create a project that specifies one of these lifecycle labels with a malicious command.

This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF. The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src` directive.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:53:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22639 | Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.

scs: fix a wrong parameter in __scs_magic

__scs_magic() needs a 'void *' variable, but a 'struct task_struct *' is
given.  'task_scs(tsk)' is the starting address of the task's shadow call
stack, and '__scs_magic(task_scs(tsk))' is the end address of the task's
shadow call stack.  Here should be '__scs_magic(task_scs(tsk))'.

The user-visible effect of this bug is that when CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
is enabled, the shadow call stack usage checking function
(scs_check_usage) would scan an incorrect memory range.  This could lead

1. **Inaccurate stack usage reporting**: The function would calculate
   wrong usage statistics for the shadow call stack, potentially showing
   incorrect value in kmsg.

2. **Potential kernel crash**: If the value of __scs_magic(tsk)is
   greater than that of __scs_magic(task_scs(tsk)), the for loop may
   access unmapped memory, potentially causing a kernel panic.  However,
   this scenario is unlikely because task_struct is allocated via the slab
   allocator (which typically returns lower addresses), while the shadow
   call stack returned by task_scs(tsk) is allocated via vmalloc(which
   typically returns higher addresses).

However, since this is purely a debugging feature
(CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE), normal production systems should be not
unaffected.  The bug only impacts developers and testers who are actively
debugging stack usage with this configuration enabled.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71103 | drm/msm: adreno: fix deferencing ifpc_reglist when not declared</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer

When advancing the target expiration for the guest's APIC timer in periodic
mode, set the expiration to "now" if the target expiration is in the past
(similar to what is done in update_target_expiration()).  Blindly adding
the period to the previous target expiration can result in KVM generating
a practically unbounded number of hrtimer IRQs due to programming an
expired timer over and over.  In extreme scenarios, e.g. if userspace
pauses/suspends a VM for an extended duration, this can even cause hard
lockups in the host.

Currently, the bug only affects Intel CPUs when using the hypervisor timer
(HV timer), a.k.a. the VMX preemption timer.  Unlike the software timer,
a.k.a. hrtimer, which KVM keeps running even on exits to userspace, the
HV timer only runs while the guest is active.  As a result, if the vCPU
does not run for an extended duration, there will be a huge gap between
the target expiration and the current time the vCPU resumes running.
Because the target expiration is incremented by only one period on each
timer expiration, this leads to a series of timer expirations occurring
rapidly after the vCPU/VM resumes.

More critically, when the vCPU first triggers a periodic HV timer
expiration after resuming, advancing the expiration by only one period
will result in a target expiration in the past.  As a result, the delta
may be calculated as a negative value.  When the delta is converted into
an absolute value (tscdeadline is an unsigned u64), the resulting value
can overflow what the HV timer is capable of programming.  I.e. the large
value will exceed the VMX Preemption Timer's maximum bit width of
cpu_preemption_timer_multi + 32, and thus cause KVM to switch from the
HV timer to the software timer (hrtimers).

After switching to the software timer, periodic timer expiration callbacks
may be executed consecutively within a single clock interrupt handler,
because hrtimers honors KVM's request for an expiration in the past and
immediately re-invokes KVM's callback after reprogramming.  And because
the interrupt handler runs with IRQs disabled, restarting KVM's hrtimer
over and over until the target expiration is advanced to "now" can result
in a hard lockup.

E.g. the following hard lockup was triggered in the host when running a
Windows VM (only relevant because it used the APIC timer in periodic mode)
after resuming the VM from a long suspend (in the host).

to trigger a hard lockup in this scenario, since commit 98c25ead5eda
("KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer &lt;=&gt; hrtimer dance to common x86"), KVM
will continue using the software timer until the guest reprograms the APIC
timer in some way.  Since the periodic timer does not require frequent APIC
timer register programming, the guest may continue to use the software
timer in

The bug can be reproduced w/ below scripts:
- mount /dev/vdb /mnt1
- mount /dev/vdc /mnt2
- umount /mnt1
- mounnt /dev/vdb /mnt1

The reason is if we created two slab caches, named f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3
and f2fs_xattr_entry-7:7, and they have the same slab size. Actually,
slab system will only create one slab cache core structure which has
slab name of "f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3", and two slab caches share the same
structure and cache address.

So, if we destroy f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3 cache w/ cache address, it will
decrease reference count of slab cache, rather than release slab cache
entirely, since there is one more user has referenced the cache.

Then, if we try to create slab cache w/ name "f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3" again,
slab system will find that there is existed cache which has the same name
and trigger the warning.

Let's changes to use global inline_xattr_slab instead of per-sb slab cache
for fixing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71106 | fs: PM: Fix reverse check in filesystems_freeze_callback()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: ftrace: Fix memory corruption when kernel is located beyond 32 bits

Since commit e424054000878 ("MIPS: Tracing: Reduce the overhead of
dynamic Function Tracer"), the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly has been used,
and this macro can generate more than 2 instructions. At the same
time, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can
be generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array. However,
as previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now UASM_i_LA)
causes a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to
corruption of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.

This corruption was observed because the variable
__cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early
during boot.

This fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of
instructions if they could exceed 2 instructions in
length. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented
code is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can
still be used, albeit in a more limited scope. This is still
preferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71110 | mm/slub: reset KASAN tag in defer_free() before accessing freed memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71110</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slub: reset KASAN tag in defer_free() before accessing freed memory

When CONFIG_SLUB_TINY is enabled, kfree_nolock() calls kasan_slab_free()

kasan_slab_free() poisons the memory and changes the tag from the
original (e.g., 0xf3) to a poison tag (0xfe).

When defer_free() then tries to write to the freed object to build the
deferred free list via llist_add(), the pointer still has the old tag,
causing a tag mismatch and triggering a KASAN use-after-free report:

The macro FAN_FROM_REG evaluates its arguments multiple times. When used

Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, potentially
causing divide-by-zero errors.

Convert the macro to a static function. This guarantees that arguments
are evaluated only once (pass-by-value), preventing the race
conditions.

Additionally, in store_fan_div, move the calculation of the minimum
limit inside the update lock. This ensures that the read-modify-write

crypto: af_alg - zero initialize memory allocated via sock_kmalloc

Several crypto user API contexts and requests allocated with
sock_kmalloc() were left uninitialized, relying on callers to
set fields explicitly. This resulted in the use of uninitialized
data in certain error paths or when new fields are added in the
future.

The ACVP patches also contain two user-space interface files:
algif_kpp.c and algif_akcipher.c. These too rely on proper
initialization of their context structures.

A particular issue has been observed with the newly added
'inflight' variable introduced in af_alg_ctx by commit:

  67b164a871af ("crypto: af_alg - Disallow multiple in-flight AIO requests")

Because the context is not memset to zero after allocation,
the inflight variable has contained garbage values. As a result,
af_alg_alloc_areq() has incorrectly returned -EBUSY randomly when
the garbage value was interpreted as true:

  https://github.com/gregkh/linux/blame/master/crypto/af_alg.c#L1209

The check directly tests ctx-&gt;inflight without explicitly
comparing against true/false. Since inflight is only ever set to
true or false later, an uninitialized value has triggered

via_wdt: fix critical boot hang due to unnamed resource allocation

The VIA watchdog driver uses allocate_resource() to reserve a MMIO
region for the watchdog control register. However, the allocated
resource was not given a name, which causes the kernel resource tree
to contain an entry marked as "" under /proc/iomem on x86
platforms.

During boot, this unnamed resource can lead to a critical hang because
subsequent resource lookups and conflict checks fail to handle the
invalid entry properly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71115 | um: init cpu_tasks[] earlier</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: init cpu_tasks[] earlier

This is currently done in uml_finishsetup(), but e.g. with
KCOV enabled we'll crash because some init code can call
into e.g. memparse(), which has coverage annotations, and
then the checks in check_kcov_mode() crash because current

Simply initialize the cpu_tasks[] array statically, which
fixes the crash. For the later SMP work, it seems to have
not really caused any problems yet, but initialize all of
the entries anyway.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71116 | libceph: make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71116</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Remove queue freezing from several sysfs store callbacks

Freezing the request queue from inside sysfs store callbacks may cause a
deadlock in combination with the dm-multipath driver and the
queue_if_no_path option. Additionally, freezing the request queue slows
down system boot on systems where sysfs attributes are set synchronously.

Fix this by removing the blk_mq_freeze_queue() / blk_mq_unfreeze_queue()
calls from the store callbacks that do not strictly need these callbacks.
Add the __data_racy annotation to request_queue.rq_timeout to suppress
KCSAN data race reports about the rq_timeout reads.

This patch may cause a small delay in applying the new settings.

For all the attributes affected by this patch, I/O will complete
correctly whether the old or the new value of the attribute is used.

This patch affects the following sysfs attributes:
* io_poll_delay
* io_timeout
* nomerges
* read_ahead_kb
* rq_affinity

Here is an example of a deadlock triggered by running test srp/002

ACPICA: Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL

Although commit 0c9992315e73 ("ACPICA: Avoid walking the ACPI Namespace
if it is not there") fixed the situation when both start_node and
acpi_gbl_root_node are NULL, the Linux kernel mainline now still crashed
on Honor Magicbook 14 Pro [1].

That happens due to the access to the member of parent_node in
acpi_ns_get_next_node().  The NULL pointer dereference will always
happen, no matter whether or not the start_node is equal to
ACPI_ROOT_OBJECT, so move the check of start_node being NULL
out of the if block.

Unfortunately, all the attempts to contact Honor have failed, they
refused to provide any technical support for Linux.

The bad DSDT table's dump could be found on GitHub [2].

The packet scheduler could attempt a reinjection after receiving an
MP_FAIL and before the infinite map has been transmitted, causing a
deadlock since MPTCP needs to do the reinjection atomically from WRT
fallback.

Address the issue explicitly avoiding the reinjection in the critical
scenario. Note that this is the only fallback critical section that
could potentially send packets and hit the double-lock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71127 | wifi: mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71127</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address

Beacon frames are required to be sent to the broadcast address, see IEEE
Std 802.11-2020, 11.1.3.1 ("The Address 1 field of the Beacon .. frame
shall be set to the broadcast address"). A unicast Beacon frame might be
used as a targeted attack to get one of the associated STAs to do
something (e.g., using CSA to move it to another channel). As such, it
is better have strict filtering for this on the received side and
discard all Beacon frames that are sent to an unexpected address.

This is even more important for cases where beacon protection is used.
The current implementation in mac80211 is correctly discarding unicast
Beacon frames if the Protected Frame bit in the Frame Control field is
set to 0. However, if that bit is set to 1, the logic used for checking
for configured BIGTK(s) does not actually work. If the driver does not
have logic for dropping unicast Beacon frames with Protected Frame bit
1, these frames would be accepted in mac80211 processing as valid Beacon
frames even though they are not protected. This would allow beacon
protection to be bypassed. While the logic for checking beacon
protection could be extended to cover this corner case, a more generic
check for discard all Beacon frames based on A1=unicast address covers

erspan: Initialize options_len before referencing options.

The struct ip_tunnel_info has a flexible array member named
options that is protected by a counted_by(options_len)
attribute.

The compiler will use this information to enforce runtime bounds
checking deployed by FORTIFY_SOURCE string helpers.

As laid out in the GCC documentation, the counter must be
initialized before the first reference to the flexible array
member.

After scanning through the files that use struct ip_tunnel_info
and also refer to options or options_len, it appears the normal
case is to use the ip_tunnel_info_opts_set() helper.

Said helper would initialize options_len properly before copying
data into options, however in the GRE ERSPAN code a partial
update is done, preventing the use of the helper function.

Before this change the handling of ERSPAN traffic in GRE tunnels
would cause a kernel panic when the kernel is compiled with
GCC 15+ and having FORTIFY_SOURCE configured:

memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0

This is done by adding a new emit_abi_ext() helper. The emit_abi_ext()
helper performs extension in place meaning a value already store in the

drm/i915/gem: Zero-initialize the eb.vma array in i915_gem_do_execbuffer

Initialize the eb.vma array with values of 0 when the eb structure is
first set up. In particular, this sets the eb-&gt;vma[i].vma pointers to
NULL, simplifying cleanup and getting rid of the bug described below.

During the execution of eb_lookup_vmas(), the eb-&gt;vma array is
successively filled up with struct eb_vma objects. This process includes
calling eb_add_vma(), which might fail; however, even in the event of
failure, eb-&gt;vma[i].vma is set for the currently processed buffer.

If eb_add_vma() fails, eb_lookup_vmas() returns with an error, which
prompts a call to eb_release_vmas() to clean up the mess. Since
eb_lookup_vmas() might fail during processing any (possibly not first)
buffer, eb_release_vmas() checks whether a buffer's vma is NULL to know
at what point did the lookup function fail.

In eb_lookup_vmas(), eb-&gt;vma[i].vma is set to NULL if either the helper
function eb_lookup_vma() or eb_validate_vma() fails. eb-&gt;vma[i+1].vma is
set to NULL in case i915_gem_object_userptr_submit_init() fails; the
current one needs to be cleaned up by eb_release_vmas() at this point,
so the next one is set. If eb_add_vma() fails, neither the current nor
the next vma is set to NULL, which is a source of a NULL deref bug
described in the issue linked in the Closes tag.

When entering eb_lookup_vmas(), the vma pointers are set to the slab
poison value, instead of NULL. This doesn't matter for the actual
lookup, since it gets overwritten anyway, however the eb_release_vmas()
function only recognizes NULL as the stopping value, hence the pointers
are being set to NULL as they go in case of intermediate failure. This
patch changes the approach to filling them all with NULL at the start
instead, rather than handling that manually during failure.

This happens because smc_special_trylock() disables IRQs even on PREEMPT_RT,
but smc_special_unlock() does not restore IRQs on PREEMPT_RT.
The reason is that smc_special_unlock() calls spin_unlock_irqrestore(),
and rcu_read_unlock_bh() in __dev_queue_xmit() cannot invoke
rcu_read_unlock() through __local_bh_enable_ip() when current-&gt;softirq_disable_cnt becomes zero.

To address this issue, replace smc_special_trylock() with spin_trylock_irqsave().</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71133 | RDMA/irdma: avoid invalid read in irdma_net_event</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71133</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/page_alloc: change all pageblocks migrate type on coalescing

When a page is freed it coalesces with a buddy into a higher order page
while possible.  When the buddy page migrate type differs, it is expected
to be updated to match the one of the page being freed.

However, only the first pageblock of the buddy page is updated, while the
rest of the pageblocks are left unchanged.

That causes warnings in later expand() and other code paths (like below),
since an inconsistency between migration type of the list containing the
page and the page-owned pageblocks migration types is introduced.

md/raid5: fix possible null-pointer dereferences in raid5_store_group_thread_cnt()

The variable mddev-&gt;private is first assigned to conf and then checked:

If conf is NULL, then mddev-&gt;private is also NULL. In this case,
null-pointer dereferences can occur when calling raid5_quiesce():

  conf-&gt;quiesce = 0;
  wake_up(&amp;amp;conf-&gt;wait_for_quiescent);

To fix this issue, the function should unlock mddev and return before

*** How to reproduce ***

This bug is only triggered when the kexec target address is allocated in
the CMA area. If no CMA area is reserved in the kernel, use the "cma="
option in the kernel command line to reserve one.

*** Root cause ***
The commit 07d24902977e ("kexec: enable CMA based contiguous
allocation") allocates the kexec target address directly on the CMA area
to avoid copying during the jump. In this case, there is no IND_SOURCE
for the kexec segment.  But the current implementation of
kimage_map_segment() assumes that IND_SOURCE pages exist and map them
into a contiguous virtual address by vmap().

*** Solution ***
If IMA segment is allocated in the CMA area, use its page_address()
directly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71140 | media: mediatek: vcodec: Use spinlock for context list protection lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71140</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: Use spinlock for context list protection lock

Previously a mutex was added to protect the encoder and decoder context
lists from unexpected changes originating from the SCP IP block, causing
the context pointer to go invalid, resulting in a NULL pointer
dereference in the IPI handler.

Turns out on the MT8173, the VPU IPI handler is called from hard IRQ
context. This causes a big warning from the scheduler. This was first
reported downstream on the ChromeOS kernels, but is also reproducible
on mainline using Fluster with the FFmpeg v4l2m2m decoders. Even though
the actual capture format is not supported, the affected code paths
are triggered.

Since this lock just protects the context list and operations on it are
very fast, it should be OK to switch to a spinlock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71141 | drm/tilcdc: Fix removal actions in case of failed probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71141</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tilcdc: Fix removal actions in case of failed probe

The drm_kms_helper_poll_fini() and drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() helpers
should only be called when the device has been successfully registered.
Currently, these functions are called unconditionally in tilcdc_fini(),
which causes warnings during probe deferral scenarios.

Reproduction steps (on a 16-CPU machine):

        # cd /sys/fs/cgroup/
        # mkdir A1
        # echo +cpuset &gt; A1/cgroup.subtree_control
        # echo "0-14" &gt; A1/cpuset.cpus.exclusive
        # mkdir A1/A2
        # echo "0-14" &gt; A1/A2/cpuset.cpus.exclusive
        # echo "root" &gt; A1/A2/cpuset.cpus.partition
        # echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu15/online
        # echo member &gt; A1/A2/cpuset.cpus.partition

When CPU 15 is offlined, subpartitions_cpus gets cleared because no CPUs
remain available for the top_cpuset, forcing partitions to share CPUs with
the top_cpuset. In this scenario, disabling the remote partition triggers
a warning stating that effective_xcpus is not a subset of
subpartitions_cpus. Partitions should be invalidated in this case to
inform users that the partition is now invalid(cpus are shared with
top_cpuset).

To fix this issue:
1. Only emit the warning only if subpartitions_cpus is not empty and the
   effective_xcpus is not a subset of subpartitions_cpus.
2. During the CPU hotplug process, invalidate partitions if
   subpartitions_cpus is empty.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71143 | clk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws

Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with
__counted_by") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'
with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer (UBSAN_BOUNDS)
about the number of elements in .hws[], so that it can warn when .hws[]
is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by
member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first
array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access
prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This
occurs in exynos_clkout_probe() due to .num being assigned after .hws[]
has been accessed:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-clkout.c:178:18
  index 0 is out of range for type 'clk_hw *[*]'

Move the .num initialization to before the first access of .hws[],
clearing up the warning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:39:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71144 | mptcp: ensure context reset on disconnect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71144</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: ensure context reset on disconnect()

After the blamed commit below, if the MPC subflow is already in TCP_CLOSE
status or has fallback to TCP at mptcp_disconnect() time,
mptcp_do_fastclose() skips setting the `send_fastclose flag` and the later
__mptcp_close_ssk() does not reset anymore the related subflow context.

Any later connection will be created with both the `request_mptcp` flag
and the msk-level fallback status off (it is unconditionally cleared at
MPTCP disconnect time), leading to a warning in subflow_data_ready():
