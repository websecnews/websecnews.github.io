A vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.  Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32381 | Denial of Service by abusing xgrammar unbounded cache in memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32381</link><description>XGrammar is an open-source library for efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation. Prior to 0.1.18, Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory. Since the cache is unbounded, a system making use of xgrammar can be abused to fill up a host's memory and case a denial of service. For example, sending many small requests to an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas would eventually cause this denial of service to occur. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.1.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32379 | XSS at ctx.redirect() function in Koajs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32379</link><description>Koa is expressive middleware for Node.js using ES2017 async functions.

This vulnerability affects confidential client applications, including daemons, web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information such as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely. Service logs generated at the information level or credential descriptions containing local file paths with passwords, Base64 encoded values, or Client secret. Additionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded certificates or certificate paths with password credential descriptions are also affected if the certificates are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials are not usable due to their invalid or expired status. To mitigate this vulnerability, update to Microsoft.Identity.Web 3.8.2 or Microsoft.Identity.Abstractions 9.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:57:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32378 | Shopware&amp;#x27;s default newsletter opt-in settings allow for mass sign-up abuse</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32378</link><description>Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform.

Multiple file upload functions within the HAX CMS PHP application call a ’save’ function in ’HAXCMSFile.php’. This save function uses a denylist to block specific file types from being uploaded to the server. This list is non-exhaustive and only blocks ’.php’, ’.sh’, ’.js’, and ’.css’ files. The existing logic causes the system to "fail open" rather than "fail closed."

In versions 0.45.0 through 0.48.6, the Cursor app introduced a regression affecting the set of file paths the Cursor Agent is permitted to modify automatically. Under specific conditions, the agent could be prompted, either directly by the user or via maliciously crafted context, to automatically write to files outside of the opened workspace. This behavior required deliberate prompting, making successful exploitation highly impractical in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the edited file was still displayed in the UI as usual for user review, making it unlikely for the edit to go unnoticed by the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 15:58:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32017 | Umbraco has a Management API Vulnerability to Path Traversal With Authenticated Users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32017</link><description>Umbraco is a free and open source .NET content management system.

read_answers()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31498</link><description>c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:09:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30150 | Shopware 6 allows attackers to check for registered accounts through the store-api</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30150</link><description>Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue.

By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is
raised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed
('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).

In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and
anatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads
(kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be
changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization
between these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much
boot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22010 | RDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup during bt pages loop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup during bt pages loop

Driver runs a for-loop when allocating bt pages and mapping them with
buffer pages. When a large buffer (e.g. MR over 100GB) is being allocated,
it may require a considerable loop count. This will lead to soft lockup:

to affect the allocation performance of normal-size buffer, set the loop
count of a 100GB MR as the threshold to call cond_resched().</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22011 | ARM: dts: bcm2711: Fix xHCI power-domain</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22011</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: dts: bcm2711: Fix xHCI power-domain

During s2idle tests on the Raspberry CM4 the VPU firmware always crashes
on xHCI power-domain resume:

This seems to be caused because of the mixed usage of
raspberrypi-power and bcm2835-power at the same time. So avoid
the usage of the VPU firmware power-domain driver, which

Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"

There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a
given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups
and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,
but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).

This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where
likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate
for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which
often serves as a baseline for products).

Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.

This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22013 | KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22013</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state

There are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's
FPSIMD/SVE state, including:

* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent
  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to
  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by
  Eric Auger:

  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997

* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an
  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.

* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,
  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses
  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR
  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale
  value in memory.

Avoid these by eagerly saving and "flushing" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME
state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the
host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is
removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is
placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'
should not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be
removed in subsequent patches.

Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous
assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:

  8383741ab2e773a9 ("KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving")

... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL
stable trees.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22014 | soc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock

When some client process A call pdr_add_lookup() to add the look up for
the service and does schedule locator work, later a process B got a new
server packet indicating locator is up and call pdr_locator_new_server()
which eventually sets pdr-&gt;locator_init_complete to true which process A
sees and takes list lock and queries domain list but it will timeout due
to deadlock as the response will queued to the same qmi-&gt;wq and it is
ordered workqueue and process B is not able to complete new server
request work due to deadlock on list lock.

Fix it by removing the unnecessary list iteration as the list iteration
is already being done inside locator work, so avoid it here and just
call schedule_work() here.

       Process A                        Process B

                                     process_scheduled_works()

   pdr_locator_work()

     pdr_locate_service()                  mutex_lock(&amp;amp;pdr-&gt;list_lock);

Timeout error log due to deadlock:

"

"

Thanks to Bjorn and Johan for letting me know that this commit also fixes
an audio regression when using the in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes it
easier to hit this race.

mm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration

A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the
same time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio-&gt;mapping should be
NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.

In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to
update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page
cache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index
entry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during
xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using
folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache
entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/

Note:
In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() &amp;&amp; folio_test_swapcache() is
used to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in
swap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a
in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since
!folio_test_anon() is true and folio-&gt;mapping is NULL.  But fortunately,
its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY
when folio-&gt;mapping is NULL.  So no need to take care of it here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22016 | dpll: fix xa_alloc_cyclic() error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22016</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:53:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32034 | Apollo Router Query Planner Vulnerable to Excessive Resource Consumption via Named Fragment Expansion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32034</link><description>The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2.

The heifsave operation could incorrectly determine the presence of an alpha channel in an input when it was not possible to determine the colour interpretation, known internally within libvips as "multiband". There aren't many ways to create a "multiband" input, but it is possible with a well-crafted TIFF image. If a "multiband" TIFF input image had 4 channels and HEIF-based output was requested, this led to libvips creating a 3 channel HEIF image without an alpha channel but then attempting to write 4 channels of data. This caused a heap buffer overflow, which could crash the process. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.16.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:26:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3382 | joey-zhou xiaozhi-esp32-server-java update sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3382</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in joey-zhou xiaozhi-esp32-server-java up to a14fe8115842ee42ab5c7a51706b8a85db5200b7 and classified as critical.

Specifically, the app’s code is not obfuscated, and no measures are in place to protect against decompilation, disassembly, or debugging. As a result, attackers can reverse-engineer the application to gain insights into its internal workings, which can potentially lead to the discovery of sensitive information, business logic flaws, and other vulnerabilities.
Utilizing this flaw, the attacker was able to identify the Hardcoded credentials from PortalUsersDatabase.dll, which contains .NET remoting definition. Inside the namespace PortalUsersDatabase, the class Users contains the functions CreateAdmin and CreateService that are used to initialize accounts in the Portal service. Both CreateAdmin and CreateService functions contain a hardcoded encrypted password along with its respective salt that are set with the function SetInitialPasswordAndSalt.

A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert(). Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32014 | estree-util-value-to-estree allows prototype pollution in generated ESTree</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32014</link><description>estree-util-value-to-estree converts a JavaScript value to an ESTree expression.

A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (width and height) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like 100%;height:100%;position:fixed;, potentially covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate content, trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking), or disrupt the intended functionality and accessibility of the website. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31475 | tarteaucitron.js allows prototype pollution via custom text injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31475</link><description>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where the addOrUpdate function, used for applying custom texts, did not properly validate input. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to modify object prototypes, affecting core JavaScript behavior, cause application crashes or unexpected behavior, or potentially introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30373 | Graylog Authenticated HTTP inputs do ingest message even if Authorization header is missing or has wrong value</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30373</link><description>Graylog is a free and open log management platform.
