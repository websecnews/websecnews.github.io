virtiofs: fix memory leak in virtio_fs_probe()

When accidentally passing twice the same tag to qemu, kmemleak ended up
reporting a memory leak in virtiofs.  Also, looking at the log I saw the
following error (that's when I realised the duplicated tag):

  virtiofs: probe of virtio5 failed with error -17

A simple reproducer looks like:
	echo 'p:myprobe sys_read fd=%a0 buf=%a1 count=%a2' &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events
	echo 1 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kprobes/myprobe/enable
	cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():

1) After installing kprobe at entry of sys_read, the first instruction
   is replaced by 'ebreak' instruction on riscv64 platform.

2) Once kernel reach the 'ebreak' instruction at the entry of sys_read,
   it trap into the riscv breakpoint handler, where it do something to
   setup for coming single-step of origin instruction, including backup
   the 'sstatus' in pt_regs, followed by disable interrupt during single
   stepping via clear 'SIE' bit of 'sstatus' in pt_regs.

3) Then kernel restore to the instruction slot contains two instructions,
   one is original instruction at entry of sys_read, the other is 'ebreak'.
   Here it trigger a 'Instruction page fault' exception (value at 'scause'
   is '0xc'), if PF is not filled into PageTabe for that slot yet.

4) Again kernel trap into page fault exception handler, where it choose
   different policy according to the state of running kprobe. Because
   afte 2) the state is KPROBE_HIT_SS, so kernel reset the current kp

btrfs: fix race between transaction aborts and fsyncs leading to use-after-free

There is a race between a task aborting a transaction during a commit,
a task doing an fsync and the transaction kthread, which leads to an
use-after-free of the log root tree. When this happens, it results in a
stack trace like the following:

The steps that lead to this crash are the following:

1) We are at transaction N;

2) We have two tasks with a transaction handle attached to transaction N.
   Task A and Task B. Task B is doing an fsync;

3) Task B is at btrfs_sync_log(), and has saved fs_info-&gt;log_root_tree
   into a local variable named 'log_root_tree' at the top of
   btrfs_sync_log(). Task B is about to call write_all_supers(), but
   before that...

4) Task A calls btrfs_commit_transaction(), and after it sets the
   transaction state to TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START, an error happens before
   it w

which is cause by a 'BUG_ON(in_nmi())' in nmi_enter().

From the call trace, we can find three interrupts (noted A, B, C above):
interrupt (A) is preempted by (B), which is further interrupted by (C).

Subsequent investigations show that (B) results in nmi_enter() being
called, but that it actually is a spurious interrupt. Furthermore,
interrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and (C) fires with
NMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation, something
we definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.

The bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in any
state change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.
Moving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible in
the GICv3 handler fixes this issue.

scsi: qla2xxx: Reserve extra IRQ vectors

Commit a6dcfe08487e ("scsi: qla2xxx: Limit interrupt vectors to number of
CPUs") lowers the number of allocated MSI-X vectors to the number of CPUs.

That breaks vector allocation assumptions in qla83xx_iospace_config(),
qla24xx_enable_msix() and qla2x00_iospace_config(). Either of the functions
computes maximum number of qpairs as:

  ha-&gt;max_qpairs = ha-&gt;msix_count - 1 (MB interrupt) - 1 (default
                   response queue) - 1 (ATIO, in dual or pure target mode)

max_qpairs is set to zero in case of two CPUs and initiator mode. The
number is then used to allocate ha-&gt;queue_pair_map inside
qla2x00_alloc_queues(). No allocation happens and ha-&gt;queue_pair_map is
left NULL but the driver thinks there are queue pairs available.

qla2xxx_queuecommand() tries to find a qpair in the map and crashes:

  if (ha-&gt;mqenable) {
          uint32_t tag;
          uint16_t hwq;
          struct qla_qpair *qpair = NULL;

          tag = blk_mq_unique_tag(cmd-&gt;request);
          hwq = blk_mq_unique_tag_to_hwq(tag);
          qpair = ha-&gt;queue_pair_map[hwq]; # &lt;- HERE

          if (qpair)
                  return qla2xxx_mqueuecommand(host, cmd, qpair);
  }

bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue

mhi_queue returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible in
the current state. This can happen when the device is in non M0
state, like M3, and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. This
case is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via
controller resume/suspend callbacks, that in turn will cause M0
transition and DB update.

So, since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update, there
is no reason to return an error.

This also fixes a use after free error for skb case, indeed a caller
queuing skb will try to free the skb if the queueing fails, but in
that case queueing has been done.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46970 | bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46970</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call

Currently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though
its result is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in
attr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,
it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.

SELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check whether the current
task's type has the corresponding "lockdown" class permission
("integrity" or "confidentiality") allowed in the policy. This means
that calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignored
generates a bogus permission check and audit record.

Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook when
its result would be honored.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:54:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46972 | ovl: fix leaked dentry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46972</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns

Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)
all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the
introduction of net namespaces.

The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is
owned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).

Commit d0febd81ae77 ("netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in

  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception: panic_on_oops

When allocation/initialization of the blk_mq_tag_set fails in
dm_mq_init_request_queue(), it is uninitialized/freed, but the pointer
is not reset to NULL; so when dev_remove() later gets into
dm_mq_cleanup_mapped_device() it sees the pointer and tries to
uninitialize and free it again.

Fix this by setting the pointer to NULL in dm_mq_init_request_queue()
error-handling. Also set it to NULL in dm_mq_cleanup_mapped_device().</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46939 | tracing: Restructure trace_clock_global() to never block</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46939</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

With the following RIP:

RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200

Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion to
happen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spin
lock and then trying to take it again:

ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
  trace_clock_global() {
    arch_spin_lock() {
      queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
        /* lock taken */
        (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)
          ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
            trace_clock_global() {
              arch_spin_lock() {
                queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
                /* DEAD LOCK! */

Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like the
above.

Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking a
lock to update the recorded "prev_time" simply use it, as two events
happening on two different CPUs that calls this at the same time, really
doesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock for
updating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time.
If it failed to be taken, that means something else is already updating
it.

tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting

The idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.
The end result is that it hits the if (offset &lt; 0) check in update_msr_sum()
which prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when
long durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and
update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the 'int' to 'off_t' accordingly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46941 | usb: dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46941</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode


According to the programming guide, to switch mode for DRD controller,
the driver needs to do the following.

To switch from device to host:
1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(host mode)
3. Reset the host with USBCMD.HCRESET
4. Then follow up with the initializing host registers sequence

To switch from host to device:
1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(device mode)
3. Reset the device with DCTL.CSftRst
4. Then follow up with the initializing registers sequence

Currently we're missing step 1) to do GCTL.CoreSoftReset and step 3) of
switching from host to device. John Stult reported a lockup issue seen
with HiKey960 platform without these steps[1]. Similar issue is observed
with Ferry's testing platform[2].

So, apply the required steps along with some fixes to Yu Chen's and John
Stultz's version. The main fixes to their versions are the missing wait
for clocks synchronization before clearing GCTL.CoreSoftReset and only
apply DCTL.CSftRst when switching from host to device.

We call io_uring_cancel_sqpoll() one by one for each ctx either in
sq_thread() itself or via task works, and it's intended to cancel all
requests of a specified context. However the function uses per-task
counters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts more
requests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep for
them to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen.

Cancel a bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpoll
and continue to use shared counters. Don't forget that we should not
remove ctx from the list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel,
otherwise the function wouldn't be able to find the context and will
hang.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46943 | media: staging/intel-ipu3: Fix set_fmt error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46943</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified

Before commit 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use
__ext4_error()"), the following series of commands would trigger a
panic:

1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test

After commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test
mount option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit will
restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.
(However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been
consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19
similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".)

This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the
following series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it
did not:

1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
2. echo test &gt; /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error

However, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is
a good thing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46946 | ext4: fix check to prevent false positive report of incorrect used inodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46946</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -g 8192 -N 1024 -I 4096 /dev/sda

So, it will end up triggering a false positive report of a corrupted

tpm: efi: Use local variable for calculating final log size

When tpm_read_log_efi is called multiple times, which happens when
one loads and unloads a TPM2 driver multiple times, then the global
variable efi_tpm_final_log_size will at some point become a negative
number due to the subtraction of final_events_preboot_size occurring
each time. Use a local variable to avoid this integer underflow.

The following issue is now resolved:

NFS: fs_context: validate UDP retrans to prevent shift out-of-bounds

Fix shift out-of-bounds in xprt_calc_majortimeo(). This is caused
by a garbage timeout (retrans) mount option being passed to nfs mount,
in this case from syzkaller.

If the protocol is XPRT_TRANSPORT_UDP, then 'retrans' is a shift
value for a 64-bit long integer, so 'retrans' cannot be &gt;= 64.
If it is &gt;= 64, fail the mount and return an error.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46953 | ACPI: GTDT: Don&amp;#x27;t corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46953</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure

When failing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties,
the GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier.

However, it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially
succeeded. Even more, should the firmware report an illegal interrupt
number that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this can result in an
IPI being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by Dann
Frazier).

Rework the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and actually
check whether the interrupt has been mapped before unmapping things.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:47:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1722 | Keycloak-core: dos via account lockout</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1722</link><description>A flaw was found in Keycloak.

An endpoint exposing internals to unauthenticated users can be used as a "padding oracle" allowing an anonymous attacker to construct a valid authentication cookie. Potentially this could be combined with vulnerabilities in other components to achieve remote code execution.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

A lenient behaviour in line delimiter handling might create a difference of interpretation between the sender and the receiver which can be exploited by an attacker to forge an SMTP envelop, allowing for instance to bypass SPF checks.

The patch implies enforcement of CRLF as a line delimiter as part of the DATA transaction.

To make sure we won't receive any CDC messages after we free the
smc_sock, add a refcount on the smc_connection for inflight CDC
message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
haven been done, for both success or failed ones.

Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
free when handling CQEs.

For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be
released.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:49:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46926 | ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46926</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller

The existing code currently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle before
checking that it's actually a SoundWire controller. This can lead to
issues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but the
pointer was set already.

This patch changes the logic so that the information provided to
the caller is set when a controller is found.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:49:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46927 | nitro_enclaves: Use get_user_pages_unlocked() call to handle mmap assert</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46927</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap

When a trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU
couldn't execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on
the memory region.  In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched
the instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR)
register before calling the trap handler. So, the trap handler will find
some random old stale value in cr19.

This patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constant magic
"bad food" value (0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to try to
understand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:49:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46929 | sctp: use call_rcu to free endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46929</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: use call_rcu to free endpoint

This patch is to delay the endpoint free by calling call_rcu() to fix
another use-after-free issue in sctp_sock_dump():

This issue occurs when asoc is peeled off and the old sk is freed after
getting it by asoc-&gt;base.sk and before calling lock_sock(sk).

To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when
calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and
ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to
hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().

If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive
and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,
it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and
we should skip it.

In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from
tsp-&gt;asoc-&gt;ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off
before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is
the same with tsp-&gt;asoc-&gt;ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,
and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.

Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the
port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu().
Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by
asoc-&gt;base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().

Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.

v1-&gt;v2:
  - improve the changelog.
  - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:49:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46930 | usb: mtu3: fix list_head check warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46930</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This may happen, since input_dev-&gt;close() calls

usb: gadget: f_fs: Clear ffs_eventfd in ffs_data_clear.

ffs_data_clear is indirectly called from both ffs_fs_kill_sb and
ffs_ep0_release, so it ends up being called twice when userland closes ep0
and then unmounts f_fs.
If userland provided an eventfd along with function's USB descriptors, it
ends up calling eventfd_ctx_put as many times, causing a refcount
underflow.
NULL-ify ffs_eventfd to prevent these extraneous eventfd_ctx_put calls.

Also, set epfiles to NULL right after de-allocating it, for readability.

For completeness, ffs_data_clear actually ends up being called thrice, the
last call being before the whole ffs structure gets freed, so when this
specific sequence happens there is a second underflow happening (but not
being reported):

binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels

In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d ("android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space")
fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,
sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so
the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous
transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.

Unfortunately, on the "free" side, the accounting of async_free_space
did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of
async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or
less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue
has gone undetected for several years.

The fix is to use "buffer_size" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
"size" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
during the free operation. These are the same except for this
corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads &lt; 8 bytes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:49:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46936 | net: fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46936</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1],
unfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing
DCCP.

The ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net
namespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore
ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops
in the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on
net-&gt;mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net
if there are some inflight time-wait timers.

This bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 ("mib: add net to
NET_ADD_STATS_BH") since the net_statistics is a global variable
instead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit
61a7e26028b9 ("mib: put net statistics on struct net") introduces
the bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when
net namespace is destroyed.

Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug
and replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless
when init_ipv4_mibs() fails.

locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()

While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can
acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops
checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly
acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed
successfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes the window between the
acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads
following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before
the write lock is truly acquired.

We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from
under it.

  Writer                                | Reader
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ep_scan_ready_list()                  |
  |- write_lock_irq()                   |
      |- queued_write_lock_slowpath()   |
	|- atomic_cond_read_acquire()   |
				        | read_lock_irqsave(&amp;ep-&gt;lock, flags);
     --&gt; (observes value before unlock) |  chain_epi_lockless()
     |                                  |    epi-&gt;next = xchg(&amp;ep-&gt;ovflist, epi);
     |                                  | read_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;ep-&gt;lock, flags);
     |                                  |
     |     atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed()     |
     |-- READ_ONCE(ep-&gt;ovflist);        |

A core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the
atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire

KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal

The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal
and unseal operations") was correct on the mailing list:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/

But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in
tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the
TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.

This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:42:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51518 | Apache James server: Privilege escalation via JMX pre-authentication deserialisation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51518</link><description>Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.

ARM: 9063/1: mm: reduce maximum number of CPUs if DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL is enabled

The debugging code for kmap_local() doubles the number of per-CPU fixmap
slots allocated for kmap_local(), in order to use half of them as guard
regions. This causes the fixmap region to grow downwards beyond the start
of its reserved window if the supported number of CPUs is large, and collide
with the newly added virtual DT mapping right below it, which is obviously
not good.

One manifestation of this is EFI boot on a kernel built with NR_CPUS=32
and CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL=y, which may pass the FDT in highmem, resulting
in block entries below the fixmap region that the fixmap code misidentifies
as fixmap table entries, and subsequently tries to dereference using a
phys-to-virt translation that is only valid for lowmem. This results in a
cryptic splat such as the one below.

net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns

Currently, tcp_allowed_congestion_control is global and writable;
writing to it in any net namespace will leak into all other net
namespaces.

tcp_available_congestion_control and tcp_allowed_congestion_control are
the only sysctls in ipv4_net_table (the per-netns sysctl table) with a
NULL data pointer; their handlers (proc_tcp_available_congestion_control
and proc_allowed_congestion_control) have no other way of referencing a
struct net. Thus, they operate globally.

Because ipv4_net_table does not use designated initializers, there is no
easy way to fix up this one "bad" table entry. However, the data pointer
updating logic shouldn't be applied to NULL pointers anyway, so we
instead force these entries to be read-only.

These sysctls used to exist in ipv4_table (init-net only), but they were
moved to the per-net ipv4_net_table, presumably without realizing that
tcp_allowed_congestion_control was writable and thus introduced a leak.

Because the intent of that commit was only to know (i.e. read) "which
congestion algorithms are available or allowed", this read-only solution
should be sufficient.

The logic added in recent commit
31c4d2f160eb: ("net: Ensure net namespace isolation of sysctls")
does not and cannot check for NULL data pointers, because
other table entries (e.g. /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log/) have
.data=NULL but use other methods (.extra2) to access the struct net.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 06:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46913 | netfilter: nftables: clone set element expression template</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46913</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test

The ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference when
performing the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that there
isn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as
interrupts are not normally added to the test rings.

To address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector before
returning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return a
value of 0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 06:57:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46917 | dmaengine: idxd: fix wq cleanup of WQCFG registers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46917</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In version 0.0.31 and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.

IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests

hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data
corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs
where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page
boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a

Here are the specific bugs:
1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec-&gt;iov.iov_len.
   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec
   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past
   iovec-&gt;iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.
2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the
   next iovec in user_sdma_request-&gt;iovs when the current iovec
   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the
   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the
   iovec pages.

This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2
because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail
iovec of an SDMA request.

Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache
(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests
with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So
this commit fixes those issues as well.

Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec
payload user SDMA requests can hit:
1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate
   pinnings.
2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),
   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)
   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock
   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.

   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)
   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.

   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the
   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between
   (2) and (3).
3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount is
   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler-&gt;lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node
   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler-&gt;lock and
   checks mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount before mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount is
   incremented.
4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not
   check mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.

   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have
   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the
   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests
   complete.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:31:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25767 | nanomq 0.21.2 contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability in /nanomq/nng/src/core/socket.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25767</link><description>nanomq 0.21.2 contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability in /nanomq/nng/src/core/socket.c.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:53:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27088 | es5-ext Regular Expression Denial of Service in `function#copy` and `function#toStringTokens`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27088</link><description>es5-ext contains ECMAScript 5 extensions.

The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a "Custom" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the "Custom" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field.

binder: signal epoll threads of self-work

In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.

It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 14:46:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1890 | Clickjacking  vulnerability in Sunny Webbox</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1890</link><description>Vulnerability whereby an attacker could send a malicious link to an authenticated operator, which could allow remote attackers to perform a clickjacking attack on Sunny WebBox firmware version 1.6.1 and earlier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 13:49:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1622 | Routinator terminates when RTR connection is reset too quickly after opening</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1622</link><description>Due to a mistake in error checking, Routinator will terminate when an incoming RTR connection is reset by the peer too quickly after opening.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 13:42:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1889 | Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in SMA Cluster Controller</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1889</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in SMA Cluster Controller, affecting version 01.05.01.R.
