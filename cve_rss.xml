Wasmtime's implementation of WebAssembly tail calls combined with stack traces can result in a runtime crash in certain WebAssembly modules. The runtime crash may be undefined behavior if Wasmtime was compiled with Rust 1.80 or prior. The runtime crash is a deterministic process abort when Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.81 and later. WebAssembly tail calls are a proposal which relatively recently reached stage 4 in the standardization process. Wasmtime first enabled support for tail calls by default in Wasmtime 21.0.0, although that release contained a bug where it was only on-by-default for some configurations. In Wasmtime 22.0.0 tail calls were enabled by default for all configurations. The specific crash happens when an exported function in a WebAssembly module (or component) performs a `return_call` (or `return_call_indirect` or `return_call_ref`) to an imported host function which captures a stack trace (for example, the host function raises a trap). In this situation, the stack-walking code previously assumed there was always at least one WebAssembly frame on the stack but with tail calls that is no longer true. With the tail-call proposal it's possible to have an entry trampoline appear as if it directly called the exit trampoline. This situation triggers an internal assert in the stack-walking code which raises a Rust `panic!()`. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.80 and prior this means that an `extern "C"` function in Rust is raising a `panic!()`. This is technically undefined behavior and typically manifests as a process abort when the unwinder fails to unwind Cranelift-generated frames. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.81 and later this panic becomes a deterministic process abort. Overall the impact of this issue is that this is a denial-of-service vector where a malicious WebAssembly module or component can cause the host to crash. There is no other impact at this time other than availability of a service as the result of the crash is always a crash and no more. This issue was discovered by routine fuzzing performed by the Wasmtime project via Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. We have no evidence that it has ever been exploited by an attacker in the wild. All versions of Wasmtime which have tail calls enabled by default have been patched: * 21.0.x - patched in 21.0.2 * 22.0.x - patched in 22.0.1 * 23.0.x - patched in 23.0.3  * 24.0.x - patched in 24.0.1 * 25.0.x - patched in 25.0.2. Wasmtime versions from 12.0.x (the first release with experimental tail call support) to 20.0.x (the last release with tail-calls off-by-default) have support for tail calls but the support is disabled by default. These versions are not affected in their default configurations, but users who explicitly enabled tail call support will need to either disable tail call support or upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. The main workaround for this issue is to disable tail support for tail calls in Wasmtime, for example with `Config::wasm_tail_call(false)`. Users are otherwise encouraged to upgrade to patched versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 18:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47813 | Wasmtime race condition could lead to WebAssembly control-flow integrity and type safety violations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47813</link><description>Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly. Under certain concurrent event orderings, a `wasmtime::Engine`'s internal type registry was susceptible to double-unregistration bugs due to a race condition, leading to panics and potentially type registry corruption. That registry corruption could, following an additional and particular sequence of concurrent events, lead to violations of WebAssembly's control-flow integrity (CFI) and type safety. Users that do not use `wasmtime::Engine` across multiple threads are not affected. Users that only create new modules across threads over time are additionally not affected. Reproducing this bug requires creating and dropping multiple type instances (such as `wasmtime::FuncType` or `wasmtime::ArrayType`) concurrently on multiple threads, where all types are associated with the same `wasmtime::Engine`. **Wasm guests cannot trigger this bug.** See the "References" section below for a list of Wasmtime types-related APIs that are affected. Wasmtime maintains an internal registry of types within a `wasmtime::Engine` and an engine is shareable across threads. Types can be created and referenced through creation of a `wasmtime::Module`, creation of `wasmtime::FuncType`, or a number of other APIs where the host creates a function (see "References" below). Each of these cases interacts with an engine to deduplicate type information and manage type indices that are used to implement type checks in WebAssembly's `call_indirect` function, for example. This bug is a race condition in this management where the internal type registry could be corrupted to trigger an assert or contain invalid state. Wasmtime's internal representation of a type has individual types (e.g. one-per-host-function) maintain a registration count of how many time it's been used. Types additionally have state within an engine behind a read-write lock such as lookup/deduplication information. The race here is a time-of-check versus time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug where one thread atomically decrements a type entry's registration count, observes zero registrations, and then acquires a lock in order to unregister that entry. However, between when this first thread observed the zero-registration count and when it acquires that lock, another thread could perform the following sequence of events: re-register another copy of the type, which deduplicates to that same entry, resurrecting it and incrementing its registration count; then drop the type and decrement its registration count; observe that the registration count is now zero; acquire the type registry lock; and finally unregister the type. Now, when the original thread finally acquires the lock and unregisters the entry, it is the second time this entry has been unregistered. This bug was originally introduced in Wasmtime 19's development of the WebAssembly GC proposal. This bug affects users who are not using the GC proposal, however, and affects Wasmtime in its default configuration even when the GC proposal is disabled. Wasmtime users using 19.0.0 and after are all affected by this issue. We have released the following Wasmtime versions, all of which have a fix for this bug: * 21.0.2 * 22.0.1 * 23.0.3 * 24.0.1 * 25.0.2. If your application creates and drops Wasmtime types on multiple threads concurrently, there are no known workarounds. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a patched release.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 18:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9463 | Expedition: Unauthenticated OS Command Injection Vulnerability Leads to Firewall Admin Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9463</link><description>An OS command injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition allows an unauthenticated attacker to run arbitrary OS commands as root in Expedition, resulting in disclosure of usernames, cleartext passwords, device configurations, and device API keys of PAN-OS firewalls.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 17:25:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9464 | Expedition: Authenticated OS Command Injection Vulnerability Leads to Firewall Admin Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9464</link><description>An OS command injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition allows an authenticated attacker to run arbitrary OS commands as root in Expedition, resulting in disclosure of usernames, cleartext passwords, device configurations, and device API keys of PAN-OS firewalls.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 17:25:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9465 | Expedition: SQL Injection Leads to Firewall Admin Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9465</link><description>An SQL injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition allows an unauthenticated attacker to reveal Expedition database contents, such as password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and device API keys.

There is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was
recently converted from just a message), that can be hit if we
wait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,
we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.

Don't call iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() in this case. While it could
be a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some
maintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that part
of the code running even when the firmware is not running.

inbound PCIe TLP spans more than two internal AXI 128-byte bursts,
the bus may corrupt the packet payload and the corrupt data may

nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing function

After commit a694291a6211 ("nilfs2: separate wait function from
nilfs_segctor_write") was applied, the log writing function
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() was able to issue I/O requests continuously
even if user data blocks were split into multiple logs across segments,
but two potential flaws were introduced in its error handling.

First, if nilfs_segctor_begin_construction() fails while creating the
second or subsequent logs, the log writing function returns without
calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction(), so the writeback flag set on
pages/folios will remain uncleared.  This causes page cache operations to
hang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,
truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when
an inode is evicted from memory, will hang.

Second, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. 
As a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's
fine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with
NILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the "sc_dirty_files"
list, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,
corrupting the block mapping.

Fix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()
on failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),
having it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and
correcting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure
that the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46870 | drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46870</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:15:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46871 | drm/amd/display: Correct the defined value for AMDGPU_DMUB_NOTIFICATION_MAX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smack: tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling

Currently, Smack mirrors the label of incoming tcp/ipv4 connections:
when a label 'foo' connects to a label 'bar' with tcp/ipv4,
'foo' always gets 'foo' in returned ipv4 packets. So,
1) returned packets are incorrectly labeled ('foo' instead of 'bar')
2) 'bar' can write to 'foo' without being authorized to write.

   (no settings, no rules, no labeled hosts, only builtin labels)

* At S, add Smack rule 'foo bar w'
   (labels 'foo' and 'bar' are instantiated at S at this moment)

* At S, at label 'bar', launch a program
   that listens for incoming tcp/ipv4 connections

* From C, at label 'foo', connect to the listener at S.
   (label 'foo' is instantiated at C at this moment)
   Connection succeedes and works.

* Send some data in both directions.
* Collect network traffic of this connection.

All packets in both directions are labeled with the CIPSO
of the label 'foo'. Hence, label 'bar' writes to 'foo' without
being authorized, and even without ever being known at C.

If anybody cares: exactly the same happens with DCCP.

This behavior 1st manifested in release 2.6.29.4 (see Fixes below)
and it looks unintentional. At least, no explanation was provided.

I changed returned packes label into the 'bar',
to bring it into line with the Smack documentation claims.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47660 | fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47660</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily

In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries.
Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a
significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens
under inode-&gt;i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock
when we remove the watch from the directory as the
__fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask()
races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from
__fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup
reports reported by users.

Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to
set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.

When parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED
flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46237 | PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the patname, pataddress, and medhis parameters in ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46237</link><description>PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the patname, pataddress, and medhis parameters in doctor/add-patient.php and doctor/edit-patient.php.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 14:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45138 | Substance3D - Stager | Use After Free (CWE-416)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45138</link><description>Substance3D - Stager versions 3.0.3 and earlier are affected by a Use After Free vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

Due to insufficient input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These OS command injection vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The OS command injection vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 03:57:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35288 | Nitro PDF Pro before 13.70.8.82 and 14.x before 14.26.1.0 allows Local Privilege Escalation in the MSI Installer because custom actions occu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35288</link><description>Nitro PDF Pro before 13.70.8.82 and 14.x before 14.26.1.0 allows Local Privilege Escalation in the MSI Installer because custom actions occur unsafely in repair mode.

Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 17:59:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46410 | PublicCMS V4.0.202406.d was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted script to the Category Managment ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46410</link><description>PublicCMS V4.0.202406.d was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted script to the Category Managment feature</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 17:59:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47823 | Livewire Remote Code Execution (RCE) on File Uploads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47823</link><description>Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire `&lt; v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file-&gt;getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.5.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 17:59:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43488 | Visual Studio Code extension for Arduino
