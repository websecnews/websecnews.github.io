When a user logs in, a temporary file which contains the configuration of the device (as visible to that user) is created in the /cache folder. An unauthenticated attacker can then attempt to access such a file by sending a specific request to the device trying to guess the name of such a file. Successful exploitation will reveal configuration information.

Starting in version 3.118.12 and prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web app, but it is possible all clients are affected. Version 3.119.10 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23817 | Dolibarr Application Home Page HTML injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23817</link><description>Dolibarr is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software package. Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injection vulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate the issue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks; and implement proper output encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than executable HTML.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21630 | Zulip non-admins can invite new users to streams they would not otherwise be able to add existing users to</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21630</link><description>Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. A vulnerability in version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:33:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0882 | qwdigital LinkWechat Universal Download Interface resource path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0882</link><description>A vulnerability was found in qwdigital LinkWechat 5.1.0.

Specifically, if untrusted and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.

Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName` can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes when sending requests from the client or responses from the server. Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or names) in a request or response that they could inject `\r\n` sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses. (i.e. exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF, etc.)

In `trillium-http` versions 0.3.12 and later, if a header name is invalid in server response headers, the specific header and any associated values are omitted from network transmission. Additionally, if a header value is invalid in server response headers, the individual header value is omitted from network transmission. Other headers values with the same header name will still be sent. In `trillium-client` versions 0.5.4 and later, if any header name or header value is invalid in the client request headers, awaiting the client Conn returns an `Error::MalformedHeader` prior to any network access. As a workaround, Trillium services and client applications should sanitize or validate untrusted input that is included in header values and header names. Carriage return, newline, and null characters are not allowed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 19:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23646 | Pimcore Admin Classic Bundle SQL Injection in Admin download files as zip</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23646</link><description>Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore.

The password reset functionality sends to the the user requesting a password change an email containing an URL to reset its password. The URL sent contains a unique token, valid during 24 hours, allowing the user to reset its password. This token is highly sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets the user's password. Prior to version 1.2.3, the reset-password URL is crafted using the "Host" HTTP header of the request sent to request a password reset. This way, an external attacker could send password requests for users, but specify a "Host" header of a website that they control. If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover. Version 1.2.3 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:19:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23649 | Any authenticated user may obtain private message details from other users on the same instance</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23649</link><description>Lemmy is a link aggregator and forum for the fediverse. Starting in version 0.17.0 and prior to version 0.19.1, users can report private messages, even when they're neither sender nor recipient of the message. The API response to creating a private message report contains the private message itself, which means any user can just iterate over message ids to (loudly) obtain all private messages of an instance. A user with instance admin privileges can also abuse this if the private message is removed from the response, as they're able to see the resulting reports.

Creating a private message report by POSTing to `/api/v3/private_message/report` does not validate whether the reporter is the recipient of the message. lemmy-ui does not allow the sender to report the message; the API method should likely be restricted to accessible to recipients only. The API response when creating a report contains the `private_message_report_view` with all the details of the report, including the private message that has been reported:

Any authenticated user can obtain arbitrary (untargeted) private message contents. Privileges required depend on the instance configuration; when registrations are enabled without application system, the privileges required are practically none. When registration applications are required, privileges required could be considered low, but this assessment heavily varies by instance.

Version 0.19.1 contains a patch for this issue. A workaround is available. If an update to a fixed Lemmy version is not immediately possible, the API route can be blocked in the reverse proxy. This will prevent anyone from reporting private messages, but it will also prevent exploitation before the update has been applied.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-42144 | Buffer over-read vulnerability in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97 allows attackers obtain sensitive information via crafte...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42144</link><description>Buffer over-read vulnerability in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97 allows attackers obtain sensitive information via crafted input to dtls_ccm_decrypt_message().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-42143 | An issue was discovered in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97.

Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.

This behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger.
