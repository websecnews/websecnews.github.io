ZITADEL uses HTML for emails and renders certain information such as usernames dynamically. That information can be entered by users or administrators. Due to a missing output sanitization, these emails could include malicious code. This may potentially lead to a threat where an attacker, without privileges, could send out altered notifications that are part of the registration processes. An attacker could create a malicious link, where the injected code would be rendered as part of the email. On the user's detail page, the username was also not sanitized and would also render HTML, giving an attacker the same vulnerability. While it was possible to inject HTML including javascript, the execution of such scripts would be prevented by most email clients and the Content Security Policy in Console UI. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.58.1, 2.57.1, 2.56.2, 2.55.5, 2.54.8 2.53.9, and 2.52.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 16:51:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41952 | Zitadel has an &amp;quot;Ignoring unknown usernames&amp;quot; vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41952</link><description>Zitadel is an open source identity management system. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called "Ignoring unknown usernames" which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesn't exist and report "Username or Password invalid". Due to a implementation change to prevent deadlocks calling the database, the flag would not be correctly respected in all cases and an attacker would gain information if an account exist within ZITADEL, since the error message shows "object not found" instead of the generic error message. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.58.1, 2.57.1, 2.56.2, 2.55.5, 2.54.8, and 2.53.9.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 16:41:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41950 | Insecure Jinja2 templates rendered in Haystack Components can lead to RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41950</link><description>Haystack is an end-to-end LLM framework that allows you to build applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more.

It is possible for an attacker to craft malicious Urls that certain functions in IdentityServer will incorrectly treat as local and trusted. If such a Url is returned as a redirect, some browsers will follow it to a third-party, untrusted site. Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.6, 6.3.10, 6.2.5, 6.1.8, and 6.0.5. Duende.IdentityServer 5.1 and earlier and all versions of IdentityServer4 are no longer supported and will not be receiving updates. If upgrading is not possible, use `IUrlHelper.IsLocalUrl` from ASP.NET Core to validate return Urls in user interface code in the IdentityServer host.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 15:50:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39318 | Ibexa Admin UI vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-site Scripting in file upload widget</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39318</link><description>The Ibexa Admin UI Bundle contains all the necessary parts to run the Ibexa DXP Back Office interface.

When a user has view but not edit right on a page in XWiki, that user can delete the page and replace it by a page with new content without having delete right. The previous version of the page is moved into the recycle bin and can be restored from there by an admin. As the user is recorded as deleter, the user would in theory also be able to view the deleted content, but this is not directly possible as rights of the previous version are transferred to the new page and thus the user still doesn't have view right on the page. It therefore doesn't seem to be possible to exploit this to gain any rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5 and 15.10.6 by cancelling save operations by users when a new document shall be saved despite the document's existing already.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 15:30:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37900 | XWiki Platform vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting through attachment filename in uploader</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37900</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When uploading an attachment with a malicious filename, malicious JavaScript code could be executed. This requires a social engineering attack to get the victim into uploading a file with a malicious name. The malicious code is solely executed during the upload and affects only the user uploading the attachment. While this allows performing actions in the name of that user, it seems unlikely that a user wouldn't notice the malicious filename while uploading the attachment.

The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the `fund` function in `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function `getResourcesToSpend` without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the `txpool` / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the `txpool` and replaced with a new one.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 19:48:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33976 | TensorFlow segfault in array_ops.upper_bound</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33976</link><description>TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. `array_ops.upper_bound` causes a segfault when not given a rank 2 tensor.

In the MediaTek vcodec driver, while mtk_vcodec_mem_free() is mostly
called only when the buffer to free exists, there are some instances
that didn't do the check and triggered warnings in practice.

We believe those checks were forgotten unintentionally. Add the checks
back to fix the warnings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42099 | s390/dasd: Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42099</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer

Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer in
dasd_eckd_dump_sense() that leads to a kernel panic in error cases.

When using indirect addressing for DASD CCWs (IDAW) the CCW CDA pointer
does not contain the data address itself but a pointer to the IDAL.
This needs to be translated from physical to virtual as well before
using it.

Revert "mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again"

Patch series "mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling".

Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into
32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for
more details).


This patch (of 2):

This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.

The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh &gt;= 1&lt;&lt;32 (which is actually common - the
default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
div64_ul() in case we want to be safe &amp; cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
thresholds are larger than 1&lt;&lt;32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
possible overflow is just moot.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42103 | btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list during reclaim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list during reclaim

There is a potential parallel list adding for retrying in
btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work and adding to the unused list. Since the block
group is removed from the reclaim list and it is on a relocation work,
it can be added into the unused list in parallel. When that happens,
adding it to the reclaim list will corrupt the list head and trigger
list corruption like below.

Fix it by taking fs_info-&gt;unused_bgs_lock.

There is a similar retry_list code in btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), but it is
safe, AFAICS. Since the block group was in the unused list, the used bytes
should be 0 when it was added to the unused list. Then, it checks
block_group-&gt;{used,reserved,pinned} are still 0 under the
block_group-&gt;lock. So, they should be still eligible for the unused list,
not the reclaim list.

The reason it is safe there it's because because we're holding
space_info-&gt;groups_sem in write mode.

That means no other task can allocate from the block group, so while we
are at deleted_unused_bgs() it's not possible for other tasks to
allocate and deallocate extents from the block group, so it can't be
added to the unused list or the reclaim list by anyone else.

The bug can be reproduced by btrfs/166 after a few rounds. In practice
this can be hit when relocation cannot find more chunk space and ends
with ENOSPC.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42104 | nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42104</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries

Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of
corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata
file inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file
gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),
tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).

The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers
of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are
read without checking.

Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as
errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer
analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42105 | nilfs2: fix inode number range checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix inode number range checks

Patch series "nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes".

This series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by
nilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted
filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting
number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is
intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  


This patch (of 3):

In the current implementation of nilfs2, "nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino", which
gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,
but its lower limit is not checked.

As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of
reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the
super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and
NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.

In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with
the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a
shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in
the C specification, so if "ns_first_ino" is set to a large value other
than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially
malfunction depending on the environment.

Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of "nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino" and
by preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO
constant in the inode number test macros.

Also, change the type of "ns_first_ino" from signed integer to unsigned
integer to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the
lower bound check introduced this time.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42106 | inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for raw
sockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for the
underlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocol
field in struct inet_diag_req_raw.

inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req to
inet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issue
occurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.

Fix this by initializing the pad field in
inet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix in
inet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.

Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls

Problem is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible
that the table-to-be-removed is still referenced by transactions being
processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally.

We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete
in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases.

AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with
commit e169285f8c56 ("netfilter: nf_tables: do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects"),
with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of
table-&gt;family which is whats triggering the above splat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42110 | net: ntb_netdev: Move ntb_netdev_rx_handler() to call netif_rx() from __netif_rx()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42110</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The cause is due to the idxd driver interrupt completion handler uses
threaded interrupt and the threaded handler is not hard or soft interrupt
context. However __netif_rx() can only be called from interrupt context.
Change the call to netif_rx() in order to allow completion via normal
context for dmaengine drivers that utilize threaded irq handling.

While the following commit changed from netif_rx() to __netif_rx(),
baebdf48c360 ("net: dev: Makes sure netif_rx() can be invoked in any context."),
the change should've been a noop instead. However, the code precedes this
fix should've been using netif_rx_ni() or netif_rx_any_context().</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42111 | btrfs: always do the basic checks for btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42111</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

And it also pinned it down to commit b5357cb268c4 ("btrfs: qgroup: do not
check qgroup inherit if qgroup is disabled").

[CAUSE]
That offending commit skips the whole qgroup inherit check if qgroup is
not enabled.

But that also skips the very basic checks like
num_ref_copies/num_excl_copies and the structure size checks.

Meaning if a qgroup enable/disable race is happening at the background,
and we pass a btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure when the qgroup is
disabled, the check would be completely skipped.

Then at the time of transaction commitment, qgroup is re-enabled and
btrfs_qgroup_inherit() is going to use the incorrect structure and
causing the above KASAN error.

[FIX]
Make btrfs_qgroup_check_inherit() only skip the source qgroup checks.
So that even if invalid btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure is passed in, we
can still reject invalid ones no matter if qgroup is enabled or not.

Furthermore we do already have an extra safety inside
btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), which would just ignore invalid qgroup sources,
so even if we only skip the qgroup source check we're still safe.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42112 | net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42112</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The parameter passed to kfree was 5a5a5a5a, which corresponds to the target field of
the jffs_inode_info structure. It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info
structure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these
variables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,
which is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the
function jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in
the function jffs2_init_inode_info.

The function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,
but in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,
which releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode
is not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked
may enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.

Since the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,
the fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42116 | igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42116</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev

During successful probe, igc logs this:

[    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHC added
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even before
register_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call works
on a partially uninitialized netdev.

Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right
after the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment,
just as in igb.

Now the log message is fine:

powerpc: Avoid nmi_enter/nmi_exit in real mode interrupt.

nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() touches per cpu variables which can lead to kernel
crash when invoked during real mode interrupt handling (e.g. early HMI/MCE
interrupt handler) if percpu allocation comes from vmalloc area.

Early HMI/MCE handlers are called through DEFINE_INTERRUPT_HANDLER_NMI()
wrapper which invokes nmi_enter/nmi_exit calls. We don't see any issue when
percpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with
CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu
allocation can come from the vmalloc area.

With kernel command line "percpu_alloc=page" we can force percpu allocation
to come from vmalloc area and can see kernel crash in machine_check_early:

drm/lima: fix shared irq handling on driver remove

lima uses a shared interrupt, so the interrupt handlers must be prepared
to be called at any time. At driver removal time, the clocks are
disabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end of
the remove process due to the devm usage.
This is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registers
which assumes clocks are enabled. A crash can be triggered by removing
the driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.
This patch frees the interrupts at each lima device finishing callback
so that the handlers are already unregistered by the time we fully
disable clocks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42128 | leds: an30259a: Use devm_mutex_init() for mutex initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic

The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty
limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications
fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,
possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so
large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For
dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty
limits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result to
exceed UINT_MAX.

This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator
sets dirty limits to &gt;16 TB.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42132 | bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42132</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot

Commit 272970be3dab ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix driver shutdown on closed

BT can't be enabled after below steps:
cold boot -&gt; enable BT -&gt; disable BT -&gt; warm reboot -&gt; BT enable failure
if property enable-gpios is not configured within DT|ACPI for QCA6390.

The commit is to fix a use-after-free issue within qca_serdev_shutdown()
by adding condition to avoid the serdev is flushed or wrote after closed
but also introduces this regression issue regarding above steps since the
VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot.

Fixed by sending the VSC to reset controller within qca_serdev_shutdown()
once BT was ever enabled, and the use-after-free issue is also fixed by
this change since the serdev is still opened before it is flushed or wrote.

net/mlx5: E-switch, Create ingress ACL when needed

Currently, ingress acl is used for three features. It is created only
when vport metadata match and prio tag are enabled. But active-backup
lag mode also uses it. It is independent of vport metadata match and
prio tag. And vport metadata match can be disabled using the
following devlink command:

 # devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name esw_port_metadata \
	value false cmode runtime

If ingress acl is not created, will hit panic when creating drop rule
for active-backup lag mode. If always create it, there will be about
5% performance degradation.

Fix it by creating ingress acl when needed. If esw_port_metadata is
true, ingress acl exists, then create drop rule using existing
ingress acl. If esw_port_metadata is false, create ingress acl and
then create drop rule.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42143 | orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List

The existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD
packets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.
As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate
of extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading
to potential list overflow.

To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After
considering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can
handle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry
timeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets
received beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed
out by the time they are handled by user-space.

Notably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like
timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42146 | drm/xe: Add outer runtime_pm protection to xe_live_ktest@xe_dma_buf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds

Fix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical
cpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet
queues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues
module parameter.

Currently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array
"struct stats_query_entry query" present inside the "bnx2x_fw_stats_req"
struct in "drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h".
Looking at the definition of the "struct stats_query_entry query" array:

struct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+
         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];

FP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and
has a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3
meaning the array has a total size of 19.
Since accesses to "struct stats_query_entry query" are offset-ted by
BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet
queues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues
is reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set
to [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if
it is not.

This is also described in a comment in the source code in
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition
of FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important
for this patch

/*
  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is
  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the
  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default
  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can
  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such
  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like
  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues
  *
  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:
  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of
  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1
  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)
  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues
  *    is Y+1
  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for
  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional
  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).
  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE
  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.
  */

However this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can
handle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.
Looking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally
using the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 ("bnx2x: Add 57712 support").
Back then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver
was later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be
limited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the
array "stats_query_entry query" was still limited to using the FP-SB
available to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was
updated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being
aware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN
warnings seen in the stack traces below.

This patch increases the size of the "stats_query_entry query" array by
replacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle
both types of NICs.

fs: don't misleadingly warn during thaw operations

The block device may have been frozen before it was claimed by a
filesystem. Concurrently another process might try to mount that
frozen block device and has temporarily claimed the block device for
that purpose causing a concurrent fs_bdev_thaw() to end up here. The
mounter is already about to abort mounting because they still saw an
elevanted bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count so get_bdev_super() will return
NULL in that case.

For example, P1 calls dm_suspend() which calls into bdev_freeze() before
the block device has been claimed by the filesystem. This brings
bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count to 1 and no call into fs_bdev_freeze() is
required.

Now P2 tries to mount that frozen block device. It claims it and checks
bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count. As it's elevated it aborts mounting.

In the meantime P3 called dm_resume(). P3 sees that the block device is
already claimed by a filesystem and calls into fs_bdev_thaw().

P3 takes a passive reference and realizes that the filesystem isn't
ready yet. P3 puts itself to sleep to wait for the filesystem to become
ready.

P2 now puts the last active reference to the filesystem and marks it as
dying. P3 gets woken, sees that the filesystem is dying and
get_bdev_super() fails.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42150 | net: txgbe: remove separate irq request for MSI and INTx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishment

In nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq-&gt;ctrl early and if it is non-NULL we
know that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)
and we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl-&gt;sqs and sq-&gt;ctrl
(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.

However, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as
a result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with
the nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*
kill_and_confirm of sq-&gt;ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq
live reference). In this case, sq-&gt;ctrl was allocated however after it was
captured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.
This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.

Solve this by re-capturing the sq-&gt;ctrl after all inflight request has
completed, where for sure sq-&gt;ctrl reference is final, and move forward
based on that.

This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting
multiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl
leading up to this race window.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42153 | i2c: pnx: Fix potential deadlock warning from del_timer_sync() call in isr</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42153</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Fix scv instruction crash with kexec

kexec on pseries disables AIL (reloc_on_exc), required for scv
instruction support, before other CPUs have been shut down. This means
they can execute scv instructions after AIL is disabled, which causes an
interrupt at an unexpected entry location that crashes the kernel.

Change the kexec sequence to disable AIL after other CPUs have been
brought down.

As a refresher, the real-mode scv interrupt vector is 0x17000, and the
fixed-location head code probably couldn't easily deal with implementing
such high addresses so it was just decided not to support that interrupt
at all.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42231 | btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42231</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode

calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or
system) block groups, which can be allocated from unallocated disk
space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.

First, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate
one zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we
should use zone_size (= data_sinfo-&gt;chunk_size) as it is.

Second, the result "avail" may not be zone aligned. Since we always
allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size
aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim
process.

This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device.
Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and
end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7223 | SourceCodester Lot Reservation Management System view_model.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7223</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester Lot Reservation Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.
