Prior to version 0.8.6-beta, LibreDesk is vulnerable to stored HTML injection in the contact notes feature. When adding notes via POST /api/v1/contacts/{id}/notes, the backend automatically wraps user input in &lt;p&gt; tags. However, by intercepting the request and removing the &lt;p&gt; tag, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML elements such as forms and images, which are then stored and rendered without proper sanitization. This can lead to phishing, CSRF-style forced actions, and UI redress attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.6-beta.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68948 | SiYuan: Information Disclosure and Authentication Bypass via Hardcoded Session Secret</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68948</link><description>SiYuan is self-hosted, open source personal knowledge management software. In versions 3.5.1 and prior, the SiYuan Note application utilizes a hardcoded cryptographic secret for its session store. This unsafe practice renders the session encryption ineffective. Since the sensitive AccessAuthCode is stored within the session cookie, an attacker who intercepts or obtains a user's encrypted session cookie (e.g., via session hijacking) can locally decrypt it using the public key. Once decrypted, the attacker can retrieve the AccessAuthCode in plain text and use it to authenticate or take over the session.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68952 | 1-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Eigent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68952</link><description>Eigent is a multi-agent Workforce. In version 0.0.60, a 1-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in Eigent. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine or server through a specific interaction (1-click). This issue has been patched in version 0.0.61.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68473 | ESF-IDF Has Out-of-Bounds Read in ESP32 Bluetooth SDP Result Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68473</link><description>ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.1, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, 5.1.6, and earlier, in the ESP-IDF Bluetooth host stack (BlueDroid), the function bta_dm_sdp_result() used a fixed-size array uuid_list[32][MAX_UUID_SIZE] to store discovered service UUIDs during the SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) process. On modern Bluetooth devices, it is possible for the number of available services to exceed this fixed limit (32). In such cases, if more than 32 services are discovered, subsequent writes to uuid_list could exceed the bounds of the array, resulting in a potential out-of-bounds write condition.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:21:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68474 | ESF-IDF Has Out-of-Bounds Write in ESP32 Bluetooth AVRCP Vendor Command Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68474</link><description>ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.1, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, 5.1.6, and earlier, in the avrc_vendor_msg() function of the ESP-IDF BlueDroid AVRCP stack, the allocated buffer size was validated using AVRC_MIN_CMD_LEN (20 bytes). However, the actual fixed header data written before the vendor payload exceeds this value. This totals 29 bytes written before p_msg-&gt;p_vendor_data is copied. Using the old AVRC_MIN_CMD_LEN could allow an out-of-bounds write if vendor_len approaches the buffer limit. For commands where vendor_len is large, the original buffer allocation may be insufficient, causing writes beyond the allocated memory. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other undefined behavior. The overflow could be larger when assertions are disabled.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:21:48 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
