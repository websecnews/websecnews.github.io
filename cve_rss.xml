The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server.

When used in combination with other functions such as `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and ultimately code execution via Foomatic. This vulnerability can be part of an exploit chain leading to remote code execution (RCE), as described in CVE-2024-47176.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:30:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47176 | cups-browsed bugs and other bugs can combine, leading to info leak and remote code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47176</link><description>CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed` contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to, auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` binds to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and can cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.

Due to the service binding to `*:631 ( INADDR_ANY )`, multiple bugs in `cups-browsed` can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:30:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45986 | A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Projectworld Online Voting System 1.0 that occurs when an account is reg...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45986</link><description>A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Projectworld Online Voting System 1.0 that occurs when an account is registered with a malicious javascript payload.

All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:28:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47179 | RSSHub&amp;#x27;s `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47179</link><description>RSSHub is an RSS network. Prior to commit 64e00e7, RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning, which could have lead to a full repository takeover. Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow. As of commit 64e00e7, this scenario has been addressed and the RSSHub repository is no longer vulnerable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8118 | Grafana alerting wrong permission on datasource rule write endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8118</link><description>In Grafana, the wrong permission is applied to the alert rule write API endpoint, allowing users with permission to write external alert instances to also write alert rules.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:49:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45984 | A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject ma...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45984</link><description>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the Donor List is viewed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45987 | Projectworld Online Voting System Version 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via voter.php.

Starting in version 1.11 and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `fetchurl.nix&gt;` did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `fetchurl.nix&gt;` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature. Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `&lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;` work in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix 2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39577 | Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements use...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39577</link><description>Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability.

Prior to version 1.3.0, given a number of preconditions, the `highest_available` setting will incorrectly assume that the identity’s highest available AAL is `aal1` even though it really is `aal2`. This means that the `highest_available` configuration will act as if the user has only one factor set up, for that particular user. This means that they can call the settings and whoami endpoint without a `aal2` session, even though that should be disallowed. An attacker would need to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user who has only OTP for login enabled and who has an incorrect `available_aal` value stored, to exploit this vulnerability. All other aspects of the session (e.g. the session’s aal) are not impacted by this issue. On the Ory Network, only 0.00066% of registered users were affected by this issue, and most of those users appeared to be test users. Their respective AAL values have since been updated and they are no longer vulnerable to this attack. Version 1.3.0 is not affected by this issue. As a workaround, those who require MFA should disable the passwordless code login method. If that is not possible, check the sessions `aal` to identify if the user has `aal1` or `aal2`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45374 | goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin Weak Password Requirements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45374</link><description>In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are

This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.

Archetype integration testing creates a file
called ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml
This file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,
which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains
credentials.

When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of
the final artifact.

If a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release
or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 08:31:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8861 | ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities &amp;lt;= 5.9.3.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8861</link><description>The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.3.2 due to incorrect use of the wp_kses_allowed_html function, which allows the 'onclick' attribute for certain HTML elements without sufficient restriction or context validation.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information, specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication, may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system, consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk, in monitoring systems, or in logging services.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 21:27:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51157 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive inform...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51157</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the Emp Name parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 19:15:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46488 | sqlite-vec v0.1.1 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the npy_token_next function.

Additionally, the Django HTTP view integration, in particular, had an exemption for Django's built-in CSRF protection (i.e., the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware) by default.

error conditions are reported in a status register.  Furthermore, the OS
can opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.

It is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,
which generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.

This case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion
itself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "maintenance mode" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time. Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 07:10:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8290 | WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible &amp;lt;= 6.7.12 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8290</link><description>The WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.12 via the WCFM_Customers_Manage_Controller::processing function due to missing validation on the ID user controlled key.
