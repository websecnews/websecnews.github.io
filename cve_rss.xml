The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:51:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31582 | jose4j before v0.9.3 allows attackers to set a low iteration count of 1000 or less.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31582</link><description>jose4j before v0.9.3 allows attackers to set a low iteration count of 1000 or less.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:51:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31581 | Dromara Sureness before v1.0.8 was discovered to use a hardcoded key.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31581</link><description>Dromara Sureness before v1.0.8 was discovered to use a hardcoded key.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-43795 | WPS Server Side Request Forgery in GeoServer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43795</link><description>GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.

initialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,
via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,
within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:39:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20273 | A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands with the pri...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20273</link><description>A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands with the privileges of root.&#13;

Sensitive configuration information has been exposed to authenticated users with the ability to read configuration via Airflow REST API for configuration even when the expose_config option is set to non-sensitive-only. The expose_config option is False by default. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected if you set expose_config to non-sensitive-only configuration. This is a different error than CVE-2023-45348 which allows authenticated user to retrieve individual configuration values in 2.7.* by specially crafting their request (solved in 2.7.2).

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.2, which fixes the issue and additionally fixes CVE-2023-45348.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:29:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38722 | IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38722</link><description>IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.2, 6.2.0, and 6.2.2 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting.

This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.
This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-43624 | CX-Designer Ver.3.740 and earlier (included in CX-One CXONE-AL[][]D-V4)  contains an improper restriction of XML external entity reference (...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43624</link><description>CX-Designer Ver.3.740 and earlier (included in CX-One CXONE-AL[][]D-V4)  contains an improper restriction of XML external entity reference (XXE) vulnerability.
