Prior to version 5.5.2 #147, ClipBucket v5 is vulnerable to arbitrary PHP code execution. In /upload/admin_area/actions/update_launch.php, the "type" parameter from a POST request is embedded into PHP tags and executed. Proper sanitization is not performed, and by injecting malicious code an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code. This allows an attacker to achieve RCE. This issue has been resolved in version 5.5.2 #147.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 16:42:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6515 | Reuse of session IDs in oatpp-mcp leads to session hijacking and prompt hijacking by remote attackers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6515</link><description>The MCP SSE endpoint in oatpp-mcp returns an instance pointer as the session ID, which is not unique nor cryptographically secure.

mm/hugetlb: fix folio is still mapped when deleted

Migration may be raced with fallocating hole.  remove_inode_single_folio
will unmap the folio if the folio is still mapped.  However, it's called
without folio lock.  If the folio is migrated and the mapped pte has been
converted to migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false, and won't
unmap it.  Due to extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio,
migration fails, restores migration entry to normal pte, and the folio is
mapped again.  As a result, we triggered BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.

The log is as follows:

netfs: fix reference leak

Commit 20d72b00ca81 ("netfs: Fix the request's work item to not
require a ref") modified netfs_alloc_request() to initialize the
reference counter to 2 instead of 1.  The rationale was that the
requet's "work" would release the second reference after completion
(via netfs_{read,write}_collection_worker()).  That works most of the
time if all goes well.

However, it leaks this additional reference if the request is released
before the I/O operation has been submitted: the error code path only
decrements the reference counter once and the work item will never be
queued because there will never be a completion.

This has caused outages of our whole server cluster today because
tasks were blocked in netfs_wait_for_outstanding_io(), leading to
deadlocks in Ceph (another bug that I will address soon in another
patch).  This was caused by a netfs_pgpriv2_begin_copy_to_cache() call
which failed in fscache_begin_write_operation().  The leaked
netfs_io_request was never completed, leaving `netfs_inode.io_count`
with a positive value forever.

All of this is super-fragile code.  Finding out which code paths will
lead to an eventual completion and which do not is hard to see:

- Some functions like netfs_create_write_req() allocate a request, but
  will never submit any I/O.

- netfs_unbuffered_read_iter_locked() calls netfs_unbuffered_read()
  and then netfs_put_request(); however, netfs_unbuffered_read() can
  also fail early before submitting the I/O request, therefore another
  netfs_put_request() call must be added there.

A rule of thumb is that functions that return a `netfs_io_request` do
not submit I/O, and all of their callers must be checked.

For my taste, the whole netfs code needs an overhaul to make reference
counting easier to understand and less fragile &amp; obscure.  But to fix
this bug here and now and produce a patch that is adequate for a
stable backport, I tried a minimal approach that quickly frees the
request object upon early failure.

I decided against adding a second netfs_put_request() each time
because that would cause code duplication which obscures the code
further.  Instead, I added the function netfs_put_failed_request()
which frees such a failed request synchronously under the assumption
that the reference count is exactly 2 (as initially set by
netfs_alloc_request() and never touched), verified by a
WARN_ON_ONCE().  It then deinitializes the request object (without
going through the "cleanup_work" indirection) and frees the allocation
(with RCU protection to protect against concurrent access by
netfs_requests_seq_start()).

All code paths that fail early have been changed to call
netfs_put_failed_request() instead of netfs_put_request().
Additionally, I have added a netfs_put_request() call to
netfs_unbuffered_read() as explained above because the
netfs_put_failed_request() approach does not work there.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40008 | kmsan: fix out-of-bounds access to shadow memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kmsan: fix out-of-bounds access to shadow memory

This occurs when memset() is called on a buffer that is not 4-byte aligned
and extends to the end of a guard page, i.e.  the next page is unmapped.

The bug is that the loop at the end of kmsan_internal_set_shadow_origin()
accesses the wrong shadow memory bytes when the address is not 4-byte
aligned.  Since each 4 bytes are associated with an origin, it rounds the
address and size so that it can access all the origins that contain the
buffer.  However, when it checks the corresponding shadow bytes for a
particular origin, it incorrectly uses the original unrounded shadow
address.  This results in reads from shadow memory beyond the end of the
buffer's shadow memory, which crashes when that memory is not mapped.

To fix this, correctly align the shadow address before accessing the 4
shadow bytes corresponding to each origin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40009 | fs/proc/task_mmu: check p-&amp;gt;vec_buf for NULL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40009</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vec_len = 0 in pagemap_scan_init_bounce_buffer() means no buffers are
allocated and p-&gt;vec_buf remains set to NULL.

This breaks an assumption made later in pagemap_scan_backout_range(), that
page_region is always allocated for p-&gt;vec_buf_index.

Fix it by explicitly checking p-&gt;vec_buf for NULL before dereferencing.

Other sites that might run into same deref-issue are already (directly or
transitively) protected by checking p-&gt;vec_buf.

Note:
From PAGEMAP_SCAN man page, it seems vec_len = 0 is valid when no output
is requested and it's only the side effects caller is interested in,
hence it passes check in pagemap_scan_get_args().

net/smc: fix warning in smc_rx_splice() when calling get_page()

smc_lo_register_dmb() allocates DMB buffers with kzalloc(), which are
later passed to get_page() in smc_rx_splice(). Since kmalloc memory is
not page-backed, this triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() in get_page() and prevents
holding a refcount on the buffer. This can lead to use-after-free if
the memory is released before splice_to_pipe() completes.

Use folio_alloc() instead, ensuring DMBs are page-backed and safe for
get_page().

media: stm32-csi: Fix dereference before NULL check

In 'stm32_csi_start', 'csidev-&gt;s_subdev' is dereferenced directly while
assigning a value to the 'src_pad'. However the same value is being
checked against NULL at a later point of time indicating that there
are chances that the value can be NULL.

Move the dereference after the NULL check.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40016 | media: uvcvideo: Mark invalid entities with id UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40016</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Mark invalid entities with id UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID

Per UVC 1.1+ specification 3.7.2, units and terminals must have a non-zero
unique ID.

```
Each Unit and Terminal within the video function is assigned a unique
identification number, the Unit ID (UID) or Terminal ID (TID), contained in
the bUnitID or bTerminalID field of the descriptor. The value 0x00 is
reserved for undefined ID,
```

If we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked
as UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.

In a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb ("media: uvcvideo: Require
entities to have a non-zero unique ID"), we ignored all the invalid units,
this broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky
this time.

This also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due
to a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an
Output Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But
when looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is
found instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.

In another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID
was 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.

Here is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.

A crash of the DD+ decoder process can occur when a malformed DD+ bitstream is processed. When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57738 | Apache Syncope: Remote Code Execution by delegated administrators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57738</link><description>Apache Syncope offers the ability to extend / customize the base behavior on every deployment by allowing to provide custom implementations of a few Java interfaces; such implementations can be provided either as Java or Groovy classes, with the latter being particularly attractive as the machinery is set for runtime reload.

net/9p: Fix buffer overflow in USB transport layer

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the USB 9pfs transport layer
where inconsistent size validation between packet header parsing and
actual data copying allows a malicious USB host to overflow heap buffers.

The issue occurs because:
- usb9pfs_rx_header() validates only the declared size in packet header
- usb9pfs_rx_complete() uses req-&gt;actual (actual received bytes) for
memcpy

This allows an attacker to craft packets with small declared size
(bypassing validation) but large actual payload (triggering overflow
in memcpy).

Add validation in usb9pfs_rx_complete() to ensure req-&gt;actual does not
exceed the buffer capacity before copying data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 05:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11948 | Excellent Infotek｜Document Management System - Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11948</link><description>Document Management System developed by Excellent Infotek has an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to upload and execute web shell backdoors, thereby enabling arbitrary code execution on the server.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11947 | bftpd Configuration File options.c expand_groups heap-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11947</link><description>A weakness has been identified in bftpd up to 6.2.

scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue

During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code
calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work
item mwq-&gt;work_q. However, if mwq-&gt;work_q is already running, the
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to
use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while
mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the
already-freed mvs_info.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mvs_pci_remove()          |
  mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()
    cancel_delayed_work() |
      kfree(mvi)          |
                          |   mvi-&gt; // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing
delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.

thunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work

The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel-&gt;dprx_work has
fully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free
scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while
tunnel-&gt;dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel
in tb_dp_dprx_work().

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0                            | CPU 1
tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |
  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()
    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()
      tb_dp_activate()           |
        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker
          cancel_delayed_work()  |
    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |
                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF
                                 |   tunnel-&gt; //UAF

Replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is
not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()
and the cleanup path acquire tb-&gt;lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()
would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.

Instead, implement proper reference counting:
- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release
  the reference in the stop function.
- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the
  reference is released in delayed work function itself.

This ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution
while preventing memory leaks.

net: mscc: ocelot: Fix use-after-free caused by cyclic delayed work

The origin code calls cancel_delayed_work() in ocelot_stats_deinit()
to cancel the cyclic delayed work item ocelot-&gt;stats_work. However,
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel the work item if it is already
executing. While destroy_workqueue() does wait for all pending work items
in the work queue to complete before destroying the work queue, it cannot
prevent the delayed work item from being rescheduled within the
ocelot_check_stats_work() function. This limitation exists because the
delayed work item is only enqueued into the work queue after its timer
expires. Before the timer expiration, destroy_workqueue() has no visibility
of this pending work item. Once the work queue appears empty,
destroy_workqueue() proceeds with destruction. When the timer eventually
expires, the delayed work item gets queued again, leading to the following
warning:

The following diagram reveals the cause of the above warning:

CPU 0 (remove)             | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mscc_ocelot_remove()       |
  ocelot_deinit()          | ocelot_check_stats_work()
    ocelot_stats_deinit()  |
      cancel_delayed_work()|   ...
                           |   queue_delayed_work()
      destroy_workqueue()  | (wait a time)
                           | __queue_work() //UAF

The above scenario actually constitutes a UAF vulnerability.

The ocelot_stats_deinit() is only invoked when initialization
failure or resource destruction, so we must ensure that any
delayed work items cannot be rescheduled.

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with disable_delayed_work_sync()
to guarantee proper cancellation of the delayed work item and
ensure completion of any currently executing work before the
workqueue is deallocated.

A deadlock concern was considered: ocelot_stats_deinit() is called
in a process context and is not holding any locks that the delayed
work item might also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant
is safe here.

This bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the
issue and validate the fix, I simulated ocelot-swit
