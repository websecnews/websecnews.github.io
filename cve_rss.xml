fork: only invoke khugepaged, ksm hooks if no error

There is no reason to invoke these hooks early against an mm that is in an
incomplete state.

The change in commit d24062914837 ("fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate
maple tree in dup_mmap()") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a
state where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.

Their placement early in dup_mmap() only appears to have been meaningful
for early error checking, and since functionally it'd require a very small
allocation to fail (in practice 'too small to fail') that'd only occur in
the most dire circumstances, meaning the fork would fail or be OOM'd in
any case.

Since both khugepaged and KSM tracking are there to provide optimisations
to memory performance rather than critical functionality, it doesn't
really matter all that much if, under such dire memory pressure, we fail
to register an mm with these.

As a result, we follow the example of commit d2081b2bf819 ("mm:
khugepaged: make khugepaged_enter() void function") and make ksm_fork() a
void function also.

We only expose the mm to these functions once we are done with them and
only if no error occurred in the fork operation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 14:20:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10345 | Unauthenticated Denial of Service via Shutdown Function in Helix Core</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10345</link><description>In Helix Core versions prior to 2024.2, an unauthenticated remote Denial of Service (DoS) via the shutdown function was identified.

Mounting btrfs from two images (which have the same one fsid and two

3. mount /dev/loop1 /mnt

reasons for this: first, the parameter value passed is greater than

ocfs2_truncate_inline are "unsigned int".

So, we need to add a sanity check for byte_start and byte_len right before

mm/page_alloc: let GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocs access highatomic reserves

Under memory pressure it's possible for GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocations to
fail even though free pages are available in the highatomic reserves. 
GFP_ATOMIC allocations cannot trigger unreserve_highatomic_pageblock()
since it's only run from reclaim.

Given that such allocations will pass the watermarks in
__zone_watermark_unusable_free(), it makes sense to fallback to highatomic
reserves the same way that ALLOC_OOM can.

fork: do not invoke uffd on fork if error occurs

Patch series "fork: do not expose incomplete mm on fork".

During fork we may place the virtual memory address space into an
inconsistent state before the fork operation is complete.

In addition, we may encounter an error during the fork operation that
indicates that the virtual memory address space is invalidated.

As a result, we should not be exposing it in any way to external machinery
that might interact with the mm or VMAs, machinery that is not designed to
deal with incomplete state.

We specifically update the fork logic to defer khugepaged and ksm to the
end of the operation and only to be invoked if no error arose, and
disallow uffd from observing fork events should an error have occurred.


This patch (of 2):

Currently on fork we expose the virtual address space of a process to
userland unconditionally if uffd is registered in VMAs, regardless of
whether an error arose in the fork.

This is performed in dup_userfaultfd_complete() which is invoked
unconditionally, and performs two duties - invoking registered handlers
for the UFFD_EVENT_FORK event via dup_fctx(), and clearing down
userfaultfd_fork_ctx objects established in dup_userfaultfd().

This is problematic, because the virtual address space may not yet be
correctly initialised if an error arose.

The change in commit d24062914837 ("fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate
maple tree in dup_mmap()") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a
state where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.

We address this by, on fork error, ensuring that we roll back state that
we would otherwise expect to clean up through the event being handled by
userland and perform the memory freeing duty otherwise performed by
dup_userfaultfd_complete().

We do this by implementing a new function, dup_userfaultfd_fail(), which
performs the same loop, only decrementing reference counts.

Note that we perform mmgrab() on the parent and child mm's, however
userfaultfd_ctx_put() will mmdrop() this once the reference count drops to
zero, so we will avoid memory leaks correctly here.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50221 | drm/amd/pm: Vangogh: Fix kernel memory out of bounds write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50221</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Empirically we can confirm that the former allocates 152 bytes for the
table, while the latter memsets the 168 large block.

Root cause appears that when GPU metrics tables for v2_4 parts were added
it was not considered to enlarge the table to fit.

The fix in this patch is rather "brute force" and perhaps later should be
done in a smarter way, by extracting and consolidating the part version to
size logic to a common helper, instead of brute forcing the largest
possible allocation. Nevertheless, for now this works and fixes the out of
bounds write.

v2:
 * Drop impossible v3_0 case. (Mario)

stress-ng-vm-segv in stress-ng is used to stress test the SIGSEGV error
handling function of the system, which tries to cause a SIGSEGV error on
return from unmapping the whole address space of the child process.

Normally this program will not cause kernel crashes. But before the
munmap system call returns to user mode, a potential task_numa_work()
for numa balancing could be added and executed. In this scenario, since the
child process has no vma after munmap, the vma_next() in task_numa_work()
will return a null pointer even if the vma iterator restarts from 0.

Recheck the vma pointer before dereferencing it in task_numa_work().</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50224 | spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix crash when not using GPIO chip select</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50224</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix error propagation of split bios

The purpose of btrfs_bbio_propagate_error() shall be propagating an error
of split bio to its original btrfs_bio, and tell the error to the upper
layer. However, it's not working well on some cases.

* Case 1. Immediate (or quick) end_bio with an error

When btrfs sends btrfs_bio to mirrored devices, btrfs calls
btrfs_bio_end_io() when all the mirroring bios are completed. If that
btrfs_bio was split, it is from btrfs_clone_bioset and its end_io function
is btrfs_orig_write_end_io. For this case, btrfs_bbio_propagate_error()
accesses the orig_bbio's bio context to increase the error count.

That works well in most cases. However, if the end_io is called enough
fast, orig_bbio's (remaining part after split) bio context may not be
properly set at that time. Since the bio context is set when the orig_bbio
(the last btrfs_bio) is sent to devices, that might be too late for earlier
split btrfs_bio's completion.  That will result in NULL pointer
dereference.

That bug is easily reproducible by running btrfs/146 on zoned devices [1]
and it shows the following trace.

[1] You need raid-stripe-tree feature as it create "-d raid0 -m raid1" FS.

At 1) a region has been established with 2 endpoint decoders (7.0 and

(3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits
the "out of order reset case" in the switch decoder. The effect though
is that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and
referencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3
trips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been
deleted.

The fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no
mandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces
in-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather
than fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.

In support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed,
cxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings.
Crashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if
caches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like
CXL region destruction.

A new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup
port-&gt;commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In
other words if decoders are allocated 0-&gt;1-&gt;2 and disabled 1-&gt;2-&gt;0 then
port-&gt;commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and
it decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50227 | thunderbolt: Fix KASAN reported stack out-of-bounds read in tb_retimer_scan()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50227</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This happens because the loop variable still gets incremented by one so

Fix this by assigning to max directly in the loop body.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50228 | mm: shmem: fix data-race in shmem_getattr()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50228</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

==================================================================

When calling generic_fillattr(), if you don't hold read lock, data-race
will occur in inode member variables, which can cause unexpected
behavior.

Since there is no special protection when shmem_getattr() calls
generic_fillattr(), data-race occurs by functions such as shmem_unlink()
or shmem_mknod(). This can cause unexpected results, so commenting it out
is not enough.

Therefore, when calling generic_fillattr() from shmem_getattr(), it is
appropriate to protect the inode using inode_lock_shared() and
inode_unlock_shared() to prevent data-race.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50229 | nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50229</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs-&gt;ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 ("don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem"), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs-&gt;ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50230 | nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50230</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the "checked" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50231 | iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks in iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50231</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsdax: dax_unshare_iter needs to copy entire blocks

The code that copies data from srcmap to iomap in dax_unshare_iter is
very very broken, which bfoster's recent fsx changes have exposed.

If the pos and len passed to dax_file_unshare are not aligned to an
fsblock boundary, the iter pos and length in the _iter function will
reflect this unalignment.

dax_iomap_direct_access always returns a pointer to the start of the
kmapped fsdax page, even if its pos argument is in the middle of that
page.  This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter-&gt;pos is not
aligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in
the file as iter-&gt;pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the
wrong place.

If iter-&gt;pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a
page, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the
destination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality
because we expose stale pmem contents.

Fix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page
boundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that
we always copy full blocks.

We're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,
so programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the
old memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.

Be careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still
need to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're
operating on.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50251 | netfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before calling skb_checksum()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50251</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If access to offset + length is larger than the skbuff length, then
skb_checksum() triggers BUG_ON().

skb_checksum() internally subtracts the length parameter while iterating
over skbuff, BUG_ON(len) at the end of it checks that the expected
length to be included in the checksum calculation is fully consumed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:53:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50252 | mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50252</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address

The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in
linear memory that is managed by the driver.

Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked
properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would
result in a warning [2] and a memory leak [3]. The problem is that the
new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and
therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.

Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre
net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not
change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of
the address and then decreasing it.

Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new(). Without this
check, when multiplication overflow occurs for nr_bits (e.g., when

due to bpf_probe_read_kernel_common(..., nr_bytes = 0x2000-0008).

Fix it by limiting the maximum value of nr_words to 511. The value is
derived from the current implementation of BPF memory allocator. To
ensure compatibility if the BPF memory allocator's size limitation
changes in the future, use the helper bpf_mem_alloc_check_size() to
check whether nr_bytes is too larger. And return -E2BIG instead of

That is because nr_bits will be set as zero in bpf_iter_bits_next()
after all bits have been iterated.

Fix the issue by setting kit-&gt;bit to kit-&gt;nr_bits instead of setting
kit-&gt;nr_bits to zero when the iteration completes in
bpf_iter_bits_next(). In addition, use "!nr_bits || bits &gt;= nr_bits" to
check whether the iteration is complete and still use "nr_bits &gt; 64" to
indicate whether bits are dynamically allocated. The "!nr_bits" check is
necessary because bpf_iter_bits_new() may fail before setting
kit-&gt;nr_bits, and this condition will stop the iteration early instead
of accessing the zeroed or freed kit-&gt;bits.

Considering the initial value of kit-&gt;bits is -1 and the type of
kit-&gt;nr_bits is unsigned int, change the type of kit-&gt;nr_bits to int.
The potential overflow problem will be handled in the following patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:54:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50255 | Bluetooth: hci: fix null-ptr-deref in hci_read_supported_codecs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50255</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci: fix null-ptr-deref in hci_read_supported_codecs

Fix __hci_cmd_sync_sk() to return not NULL for unknown opcodes.

__hci_cmd_sync_sk() returns NULL if a command returns a status event.
However, it also returns NULL where an opcode doesn't exist in the
hci_cc table because hci_cmd_complete_evt() assumes status = skb-&gt;data[0]
for unknown opcodes.
This leads to null-ptr-deref in cmd_sync for HCI_OP_READ_LOCAL_CODECS as
there is no hci_cc for HCI_OP_READ_LOCAL_CODECS, which always assumes

netfilter: nf_reject_ipv6: fix potential crash in nf_send_reset6()

I got a syzbot report without a repro [1] crashing in nf_send_reset6()

I think the issue is that dev-&gt;hard_header_len is zero, and we attempt
later to push an Ethernet header.

Use LL_MAX_HEADER, as other functions in net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv6.c.

Concurrent execution of module unload and get_info() trigered the warning.
The root cause is as follows:

cpu0				      cpu1
module_exit
//mod-&gt;state = MODULE_STATE_GOING
  ip6table_nat_exit
    xt_unregister_template
	kfree(t)
	//removed from templ_list

							return t;  //not get refcnt
					  module_put(t-&gt;me) //uaf
    unregister_pernet_subsys
    //remove table from xt_net list

While xt_table module was going away and has been removed from
xt_templates list, we couldnt get refcnt of xt_table-&gt;me. Check
module in xt_net-&gt;tables list re-traversal to fix it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:54:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50258 | net: fix crash when config small gso_max_size/gso_ipv4_max_size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50258</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

macsec: Fix use-after-free while sending the offloading packet

KASAN reports the following UAF. The metadata_dst, which is used to
store the SCI value for macsec offload, is already freed by
metadata_dst_free() in macsec_free_netdev(), while driver still use it
for sending the packet.

To fix this issue, dst_release() is used instead to release
metadata_dst. So it is not freed instantly in macsec_free_netdev() if
still referenced by skb.

trie_get_next_key() allocates a node stack with size trie-&gt;max_prefixlen,
while it writes (trie-&gt;max_prefixlen + 1) nodes to the stack when it has
full paths from the root to leaves. For example, consider a trie with
max_prefixlen is 8, and the nodes with key 0x00/0, 0x00/1, 0x00/2, ...
0x00/8 inserted. Subsequent calls to trie_get_next_key with _key with
.prefixlen = 8 make 9 nodes be written on the node stack with size 8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 07:54:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51762 | WordPress PropertyShift plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.0 -
