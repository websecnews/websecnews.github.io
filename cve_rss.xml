This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /api/files/recipepictures/ of the component SVG File Upload Handler. The manipulation of the argument force_serve_as with the input picture' leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. NOTE: The project maintainer explains that "this is 'nonsense' and practically irrelevant according to the project's security policy" which expects additional authentication for the software.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 22:23:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45509 | In MISP through 2.4.196, app/Controller/BookmarksController.php does not properly restrict access to bookmarks data in the case where the us...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45509</link><description>In MISP through 2.4.196, app/Controller/BookmarksController.php does not properly restrict access to bookmarks data in the case where the user is not an org admin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 21:40:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45508 | HTMLDOC before 1.9.19 has an out-of-bounds write in parse_paragraph in ps-pdf.cxx because of an attempt to strip leading whitespace from a w...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45508</link><description>HTMLDOC before 1.9.19 has an out-of-bounds write in parse_paragraph in ps-pdf.cxx because of an attempt to strip leading whitespace from a whitespace-only node.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 21:30:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5053 | Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag &amp;amp; Drop WP Form Builder &amp;lt;= 5.1.18 -  Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Mailchimp Integration Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5053</link><description>The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag &amp; Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Malichimp API key update due to an insufficient capability check on the verifyRequest function in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.18.

kcm: Serialise kcm_sendmsg() for the same socket.

syzkaller reported UAF in kcm_release(). [0]

The scenario is

  1. Thread A builds a skb with MSG_MORE and sets kcm-&gt;seq_skb.

  2. Thread A resumes building skb from kcm-&gt;seq_skb but is blocked
     by sk_stream_wait_memory()

  3. Thread B calls sendmsg() concurrently, finishes building kcm-&gt;seq_skb
     and puts the skb to the write queue

  4. Thread A faces an error and finally frees skb that is already in the
     write queue

  5. kcm_release() does double-free the skb in the write queue

When a thread is building a MSG_MORE skb, another thread must not touch it.

Let's add a per-sk mutex and serialise kcm_sendmsg().
