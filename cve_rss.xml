In version 0.0.31 and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.  This vulnerability is patched in version 0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:57:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-36237 | Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in Bagisto before v.1.5.1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML script.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36237</link><description>Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in Bagisto before v.1.5.1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML script.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:57:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25751 | A Stack Based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC9 v.3.0 with firmware version v.15.03.06.42_multi allows a remote attacker to execute...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25751</link><description>A Stack Based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC9 v.3.0 with firmware version v.15.03.06.42_multi allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the fromSetSysTime function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24564 | Vyper extract32 can ready dirty memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24564</link><description>Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine.

errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.

As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8,
you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to
cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist before

In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn't
take into account that report-&gt;size can be zero. When running the
syzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to
calculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to

IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests

hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data
corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs
where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page
boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a

Here are the specific bugs:
1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec-&gt;iov.iov_len.
   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec
   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past
   iovec-&gt;iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.
2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the
   next iovec in user_sdma_request-&gt;iovs when the current iovec
   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the
   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the
   iovec pages.

This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2
because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail
iovec of an SDMA request.

Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache
(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests
with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So
this commit fixes those issues as well.

Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec
payload user SDMA requests can hit:
1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate
   pinnings.
2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),
   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)
   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock
   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.

   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)
   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.

   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the
   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between
   (2) and (3).
3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount is
   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler-&gt;lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node
   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler-&gt;lock and
   checks mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount before mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount is
   incremented.
4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not
   check mmu_rb_node-&gt;refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.

   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have
   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the
   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests
   complete.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 17:31:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25767 | nanomq 0.21.2 contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability in /nanomq/nng/src/core/socket.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25767</link><description>nanomq 0.21.2 contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability in /nanomq/nng/src/core/socket.c.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:53:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27088 | es5-ext Regular Expression Denial of Service in `function#copy` and `function#toStringTokens`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27088</link><description>es5-ext contains ECMAScript 5 extensions.

binder: signal epoll threads of self-work

In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.

It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 14:46:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1890 | Clickjacking  vulnerability in Sunny Webbox</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1890</link><description>Vulnerability whereby an attacker could send a malicious link to an authenticated operator, which could allow remote attackers to perform a clickjacking attack on Sunny WebBox firmware version 1.6.1 and earlier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 13:49:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1622 | Routinator terminates when RTR connection is reset too quickly after opening</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1622</link><description>Due to a mistake in error checking, Routinator will terminate when an incoming RTR connection is reset by the peer too quickly after opening.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 13:42:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1889 | Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in SMA Cluster Controller</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1889</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in SMA Cluster Controller, affecting version 01.05.01.R.

net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration

Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.

The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number
but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
would return the same minor number.

Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()
to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()
to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the
given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding
release_minor() call.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 14:09:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-46905 | net: hso: fix NULL-deref on disconnect regression</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-46905</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Avoid potential out-of-bounds read in pci_dev_for_each_resource()

Coverity complains that pointer in the pci_dev_for_each_resource() may be
wrong, i.e., might be used for the out-of-bounds read.

There is no actual issue right now because we have another check afterwards
and the out-of-bounds read is not being performed. In any case it's better
code with this fixed, hence the proposed change.

As Jonas pointed out "It probably makes the code slightly less performant
as res will now be checked for being not NULL (which will always be true),
but I doubt it will be significant (or in any hot paths)."</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 08:26:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52467 | mfd: syscon: Fix null pointer dereference in of_syscon_register()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52467</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The lock_class_key is still registered and can be found in
lock_keys_hash hlist after subsys_private is freed in error
handler path.A task who iterate over the lock_keys_hash
later may cause use-after-free.So fix that up and unregister
the lock_class_key before kfree(cp).

On our platform, a driver fails to kset_register because of
creating duplicate filename '/class/xxx'.With Kasan enabled,
it prints a invalid-access bug report.

As CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC is not set, Kasan reports invalid-access
not use-after-free here.In this case, modprobe is manipulating
the corrupted lock_keys_hash hlish where lock_class_key is already
freed before.

It's worth noting that this only can happen if lockdep is enabled,
which is not true for normal system.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 08:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52469 | drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52469</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: core: Fix NULL pointer dereference in zone registration error path

If device_register() in thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips()
returns an error, the tz variable is set to NULL and subsequently
dereferenced in kfree(tz-&gt;tzp).

Commit adc8749b150c ("thermal/drivers/core: Use put_device() if
device_register() fails") added the tz = NULL assignment in question to
avoid a possible double-free after dropping the reference to the zone
device.  However, after commit 4649620d9404 ("thermal: core: Make
thermal_zone_device_unregister() return after freeing the zone"), that
assignment has become redundant, because dropping the reference to the
zone device does not cause the zone object to be freed any more.

Drop it to address the NULL pointer dereference.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 08:26:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0455 | SSRF on AWS deployed instances of AnythingLLM via /metadata</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0455</link><description>The inclusion of the web scraper for AnythingLLM means that any user with the proper authorization level (manager, admin, and when in single user) could put in the URL
