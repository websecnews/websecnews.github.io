When a user transforms on the root level or single source with transforms, and the client sends the same query with different variables, the initial variables are used in all following requests until the cache evicts DocumentNode. If a token is sent via variables, the following requests will act like the same token is sent even if the following requests have different tokens. This can cause a short memory leak but it won't grow per each request but per different operation until the cache evicts DocumentNode by LRU mechanism.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27098 | Unwanted access to the entire file system vulnerability due to a missing check in `staticFiles` HTTP handler in graphql-mesh</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27098</link><description>GraphQL Mesh is a GraphQL Federation framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation and non-GraphQL Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Missing check vulnerability in the static file handler allows any client to access the files in the server's file system. When `staticFiles` is set in the `serve` settings in the configuration file, the following handler doesn't check if `absolutePath` is still under the directory provided as `staticFiles`. Users have two options to fix vulnerability; 1. Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18` 2. Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24893 | Remote code execution as guest via SolrSearchMacros request in xwiki</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24893</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any guest can perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to `SolrSearch`. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. To reproduce on an instance, without being logged in, go to `&lt;host&gt;/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch?media=rss&amp;text=%7D%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28"Hello%20from"%20%2B%20"%20search%20text%3A"%20%2B%20%2823%20%2B%2019%29%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D%20`. If there is an output, and the title of the RSS feed contains `Hello from search text:42`, then the instance is vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1 and 16.5.0RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may edit `Main.SolrSearchMacros` in `SolrSearchMacros.xml` on line 955 to match the `rawResponse` macro in `macros.vm#L2824` with a content type of `application/xml`, instead of simply outputting the content of the feed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25299 | Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the real-time collaboration package</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25299</link><description>CKEditor 5 is a modern JavaScript rich-text editor with an MVC architecture. During a recent internal audit, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration package. This vulnerability affects user markers, which represent users' positions within the document. It can lead to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, which might happen with a very specific editor and token endpoint configuration. This vulnerability affects only installations with Real-time collaborative editing enabled. The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 44.2.1 (and above). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0352 | Rapid Response Monitoring My Security Account App Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0352</link><description>Rapid Response Monitoring My Security Account App utilizes an API that could be exploited by an attacker to modify request data, potentially causing the API to return information about other users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1265 | Elseta Vinci Protocol Analyzer OS Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1265</link><description>An OS command injection vulnerability exists in Vinci Protocol Analyzer that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and perform code execution on affected system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:09:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26618 | SSH SFTP packet size not verified properly in Erlang OTP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26618</link><description>Erlang is a programming language and runtime system for building massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. OTP is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang. Packet size is not verified properly for SFTP packets. As a result when multiple SSH packets (conforming to max SSH packet size) are received by ssh, they might be combined into an SFTP packet which will exceed the max allowed packet size and potentially cause large amount of memory to be allocated. Note that situation described above can only happen for successfully authenticated users after completing the SSH handshake. This issue has been patched in OTP versions 27.2.4, 26.2.5.9, and 25.3.2.18. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 19:10:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27096 | SQL Injection endpoint &amp;#x27;html/personalizacao_upload.php&amp;#x27; parameter &amp;#x27;id_campo&amp;#x27; in WeGIA</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27096</link><description>WeGIA is a Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language.

A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the heap overflow. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 22:31:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27090 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in sliver teamserver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27090</link><description>Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing.

During the network boot process, when trying to search for the configuration file, grub copies data from a user controlled environment variable into an internal buffer using the grub_strcpy() function. During this step, it fails to consider the environment variable length when allocating the internal buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. If correctly exploited, this issue may result in remote code execution through the same network segment grub is searching for the boot information, which can be used to by-pass secure boot protections.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0677 | Grub2: ufs: integer overflow may lead to heap based out-of-bounds write when handling symlinks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0677</link><description>A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup, the grub's UFS module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content, however, it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs, grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer, the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious filesystem, and as a result, it will corrupt data stored in the heap, allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-10095 | Various Lexmark devices have CSRF that allows an attacker to modify the configuration of the device.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-10095</link><description>Various Lexmark devices have CSRF that allows an attacker to modify the configuration of the device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:12:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0893 | Symantec Diagnostic Tool (SymDiag), prior to 3.0.79, may be susceptible to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0893</link><description>Symantec Diagnostic Tool (SymDiag), prior to 3.0.79, may be susceptible to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:12:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1118 | Grub2: commands/dump: the dump command is not in lockdown when secure boot is enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1118</link><description>A flaw was found in grub2.

If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1. Not heavily modify the default settings in a way that ends up with shorter or less frequent regulation bans. The default settings effectively mitigate any potential for this issue to be exploited. and 2. Disable the ability for users to login via an email address.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:32:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0999 | Heap buffer overflow in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 133.0.6943.126 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0999</link><description>Heap buffer overflow in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 133.0.6943.126 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the "requested" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items. This is a vulnerability that allows update access to unintended fields, potentially impacting the password field for user accounts. This has been addressed in version 11.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:54:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47160 | IBM Cognos Controller XML external entity injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47160</link><description>IBM Cognos Controller 11.0.0 through 11.0.1 FP3 and IBM Controller 11.1.0

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:48:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13743 | Wonder Video Embed &amp;lt;= 2.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13743</link><description>The Wonder Video Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wonderplugin_video shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade.

Because of the nature of arbitrary user-submited code execution, this allows user to execute potentially malicious code to perform damage or extract sensitive information. By loading the module containing the following code and run the command, the bot token can be extracted. Then the attacker can load a blocking module to sabotage the bot (DDoS attack) and the token can be used to make the fake bot act as the real one. If the bot has very high privilege, the attacker basically has full control before the user kicks the bot.

Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade.

Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector.

Authentication using Spid and CIE is based on the SAML2 standard which provides two entities: Identity Provider (IDP): the system that authenticates users and provides identity information (SAML affirmation) to the Service Provider, in essence, is responsible for the management of the credentials and identity of users; Service Provider (SP): the system that provides a service to the user and relies on the Identity Provider to authenticate the user, receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. The validation logic of the signature is central as it ensures that you cannot create a SAML response with arbitrary assertions and then impersonate other users. There is no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object, it follows that if an attacker injects an item signed as the first element, all other signatures will not be verified. The only requirement is to have an XML element legitimately signed by the IdP, a condition that is easily met using the IdP's public metadata. An attacker could create an arbitrary SAML response that would be accepted by SPs using vulnerable SDKs, allowing him to impersonate any Spid and/or CIE user.

A vulnerability in ZOO-Project's WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through path traversal. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, does not properly validate file paths referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesn't properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative path traversal sequences (../). When combined with VRT's raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through path traversal, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade.

Duende.AccessTokenManagement contains a race condition when requesting access tokens using the client credentials flow. Concurrent requests to obtain an access token using differing protocol parameters can return access tokens obtained with the wrong scope, resource indicator, or other protocol parameters. Such usage is somewhat atypical, and only a small percentage of users are likely to be affected. Duende.AccessTokenManagement can request access tokens using the client credentials flow in several ways. In basic usage, the client credentials flow is configured once and the parameters do not vary. In more advanced situations, requests with varying protocol parameters may be made by calling specific overloads of these methods: `HttpContext.GetClientAccessTokenAsync()` and `IClientCredentialsTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync()`. There are overloads of both of these methods that accept a `TokenRequestParameters` object that customizes token request parameters. However, concurrent requests with varying `TokenRequestParameters` will result in the same token for all concurrent calls. Most users can simply update the NuGet package to the latest version. Customizations of the `IClientCredentialsTokenCache` that derive from the default implementation (`DistributedClientCredentialsTokenCache`) will require a small code change, as its constructor was changed to add a dependency on the `ITokenRequestSynchronization` service. The synchronization service will need to be injected into the derived class and passed to the base constructor. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how Duende.AccessTokenManagement is used and on the security architecture of the solution. Most users will not be vulnerable to this issue. More advanced users may run into this issue by calling the methods specified above with customized token request parameters. The impact of obtaining an access token with different than intended protocol parameters will vary depending on application logic, security architecture, and the authorization policy of the resource servers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:37:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26058 | Webkul QloApps v1.6.1 exposes authentication tokens in URLs during redirection.

pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch-&gt;limit == 0

Expected behaviour:
In case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a
packet in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.
Then, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase
scheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return
`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

Weird behaviour:
In case we set `sch-&gt;limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a
scheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.
This means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.
Then, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by
one. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by
one and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

The problem is:
Let's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.
 - Qdisc_A's type must have '-&gt;graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.
   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch-&gt;limit == 0`.
 - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.

Enqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:
 - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -&gt; pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)
 - Qdisc_B-&gt;q.qlen += 1
 - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`
 - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` =&gt; hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.

The whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A-&gt;q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B-&gt;q.qlen == 1.
Replace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.
This violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.

Bug impact: This issue can be used for user-&gt;kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21703 | netem: Update sch-&amp;gt;q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21703</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netem: Update sch-&gt;q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()

qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() notifies parent qdisc only if child
qdisc becomes empty, therefore we need to reduce the backlog of the
child qdisc before calling it. Otherwise it would miss the opportunity
to call cops-&gt;qlen_notify(), in the case of DRR, it resulted in UAF
since DRR uses -&gt;qlen_notify() to maintain its active list.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13689 | Uncode Core &amp;lt;= 2.9.1.6 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Shortcode Execution in uncode_get_medias</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13689</link><description>The Uncode Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1.6.
