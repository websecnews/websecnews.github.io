A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the handling of user-supplied input in the Bundles, Comments, and Sightings components. Untrusted data was not properly sanitized before being rendered in templates and tables, which could allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application. The issue was due to unsafe use of innerHTML and insufficient validation of dynamic URLs and model fields. This vulnerability has been fixed by escaping untrusted data, replacing innerHTML assignments with safer DOM methods, encoding URLs with encodeURIComponent, and improving input validation in the affected models.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:31:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34227 | Nagios XI &amp;lt; 2026R1 Configuration Wizard Authenticated Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34227</link><description>Nagios XI &lt; 2026R1 is vulnerable to an authenticated command injection vulnerability within the MongoDB Database, MySQL Query, MySQL Server, Postgres Server, and Postgres Query wizards.

Because the proxy forwards requests and headers, an attacker can reach internal-only endpoints and link-local metadata services, retrieve instance role credentials or other sensitive metadata, and interact with internal APIs and services that are not intended to be internet-facing. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the proxy with the target resource encoded in the URL; many cors-anywhere deployments forward arbitrary methods and headers (including PUT), which can permit exploitation of IMDSv2 workflows as well as access to internal management APIs. Successful exploitation can result in theft of cloud credentials, unauthorized access to internal services, remote code execution or privilege escalation (depending on reachable backends), data exfiltration, and full compromise of cloud resources. Mitigation includes: restricting the proxy to trusted origins or authentication, whitelisting allowed target hosts, preventing access to link-local and internal IP ranges, removing support for unsafe HTTP methods/headers, enabling cloud provider mitigations, and deploying network-level protections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 14:58:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40836 | Ericsson Indoor Connect 8855 - Improper Input Validation Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40836</link><description>Ericsson

Affected versions allow standard users to add custom configuration files. These files, which are loaded in alphabetical order, can override or change the settings of the original configuration files, creating a security vulnerability. This issue stems from improper directory access management.

Prior to version 2.2.18, Rack::QueryParser enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated by &amp;, while still splitting on both &amp; and ;. As a result, attackers could use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service vector. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.18.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 14:49:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10541 | Local Privilege Escalation via Insecure Update Mechanism in iMonitor EAM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10541</link><description>iMonitor EAM 9.6394 installs a system service (eamusbsrv64.exe) that runs with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges. This service includes an insecure update mechanism that automatically loads files placed in the C:\sysupdate\ directory during startup. Because any local user can create and write to this directory, an attacker can place malicious DLLs or executables in it. Upon service restart, the files are moved to the application’s installation path and executed with SYSTEM privileges, leading to privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 14:49:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10542 | Insecure Default Admin Credentials Enable Full Administrative Access in iMonitor EAM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10542</link><description>iMonitor EAM 9.6394 ships with default administrative credentials that are also displayed within the management client’s connection dialog.

Prior to version 0.48.0, Omni Wireguard SideroLink has the potential to escape. Omni and each Talos machine establish a peer-to-peer (P2P) SideroLink connection using WireGuard to mutually authenticate and authorize access. The WireGuard interface on Omni is configured to ensure that the source IP address of an incoming packet matches the IPv6 address assigned to the Talos peer. However, it performs no validation on the packet's destination address. The Talos end of the SideroLink connection cannot be considered a trusted environment. Workloads running on Kubernetes, especially those configured with host networking, could gain direct access to this link. Therefore, a malicious workload could theoretically send arbitrary packets over the SideroLink interface.

directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8869</link><description>When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706.
Note that upgrading pip to a "fixed" version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by using a Python version that implements PEP 706.

Note that this is a vulnerability in pip's fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706
and therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're using a Python version that implements PEP 706
then pip doesn't use the "vulnerable" fallback code.

Mitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python &gt;=3.9.17, &gt;=3.10.12, &gt;=3.11.4, or &gt;=3.12),
applying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:20:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48868 | Horilla vulnerable to authenticated RCE via eval() in project_bulk_archive</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48868</link><description>Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:52:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23248 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the nvdisasm binary where a user may cause an out-of-bounds read by passin...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23248</link><description>NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the nvdisasm binary where a user may cause an out-of-bounds read by passing a malformed ELF file to nvdisasm.

In versions 0.5.3 and earlier of astral-tokio-tar, tar archives may extract outside of their intended destination directory when using the Entry::unpack_in_raw API. Additionally, the Entry::allow_external_symlinks control (which defaults to true) could be bypassed via a pair of symlinks that individually point within the destination but combine to point outside of it. These behaviors could be used individually or combined to bypass the intended security control of limiting extraction to the given directory. This in turn would allow an attacker with a malicious tar archive to perform an arbitrary file write and potentially pivot into code execution. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.4. There is no workaround other than upgrading.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 20:14:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57636 | OS Command injection vulnerability in D-Link C1 2020-02-21.

This flaw may allow a previously deleted user to authenticate using their FIDO credentials and impersonate the newly created user, resulting in unauthorized access. The vulnerability applies only to deployments that utilize FIDO-based authentication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:38:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56394 | Free5gc 4.0.1 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow.

A single cryptographic key is used across all tenants to sign authentication cookies, allowing a privileged user in one tenant to forge authentication cookies for users in other tenants.

Because the Auto-Login feature is enabled by default, this flaw may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially take over accounts in other tenants. Successful exploitation requires access to Adaptive Authentication functionality, which is typically restricted to high-privileged users. The vulnerability is only exploitable when Auto-Login is enabled, reducing its practical impact in deployments where the feature is disabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:10:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6429 | Content Spoofing in Multiple WSO2 Products via Error Message Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6429</link><description>A content spoofing vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper error message handling.

dmaengine: ti: edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_map

Fix a critical memory allocation bug in edma_setup_from_hw() where
queue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory. The code
declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8),
but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.

This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing:
  queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;
  queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;

The bug manifested as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction"
on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the
memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.

Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which
automatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39870 | dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39870</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()

The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error
handling is a bit subtle.  It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner
way.  The issues here are:

1) If "idxd-&gt;max_wqs" is &lt;= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when
   "conf_dev" hasn't been initialized.
2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again "conf_dev" is invalid.  It's
   either uninitialized or it points to the "conf_dev" from the
   previous iteration so it leads to a double free.

It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then
the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations.  I also
renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto
was located.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39871 | dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB

can_put_echo_skb() takes ownership of the SKB and it may be freed

However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call.

Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done
touching the SKB.

The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and
also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not
matter.

An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb
memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.

macsec: sync features on RTM_NEWLINK

Syzkaller managed to lock the lower device via ETHTOOL_SFEATURES:

It happens because lower features are out of sync with the upper:

  __dev_ethtool (real_dev)
    netdev_lock_ops(real_dev)
    ETHTOOL_SFEATURES
      __netdev_features_change

	          netdev_lock_ops(lower) # lower == real_dev
		  stuck
		  ...

    netdev_unlock_ops(real_dev)

Per commit af5f54b0ef9e ("net: Lock lower level devices when updating
features"), we elide the lock/unlock when the upper and lower features
are synced. Makes sure the lower (real_dev) has proper features after
the macsec link has been created. This makes sure we never hit the
situation where we need to sync upper flags to the lower.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39875 | igb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39875</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

not added to the test rings.

Since commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in

mm/damon/sysfs: fix use-after-free in state_show()

state_show() reads kdamond-&gt;damon_ctx without holding damon_sysfs_lock. 
This allows a use-after-free race:

CPU 0                         CPU 1

damon_is_running(ctx);        /* ctx is freed */
mutex_lock(&amp;amp;ctx-&gt;kdamond_lock); /* UAF */

(The race can also occur with damon_sysfs_kdamonds_rm_dirs() and
damon_sysfs_kdamond_release(), which free or replace the context under
damon_sysfs_lock.)

Fix by taking damon_sysfs_lock before dereferencing the context, mirroring
the locking used in pid_show().

The bug has existed since state_show() first accessed kdamond-&gt;damon_ctx.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39878 | ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39878</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error

The function move_dirty_folio_in_page_array() was created by commit
ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method") by
moving code from ceph_writepages_start() to this function.

This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked
by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the
caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the
loop.

However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it
always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and
then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are
silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may
later crash the kernel.

The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39879 | ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39879</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()

The function ceph_process_folio_batch() sets folio_batch entries to
NULL, which is an illegal state.  Before folio_batch_release() crashes
due to this API violation, the function ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()
is supposed to remove those NULLs from the array.

However, since commit ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce
ceph_process_folio_batch() method"), this shifting doesn't happen
anymore because the "for" loop got moved to ceph_process_folio_batch(),
and now the `i` variable that remains in ceph_writepages_start()
doesn't get incremented anymore, making the shifting effectively
unreachable much of the time.

Later, commit 1551ec61dc55 ("ceph: introduce ceph_submit_write()
method") added more preconditions for doing the shift, replacing the
`i` check (with something that is still just as broken):

- if ceph_process_folio_batch() fails, shifting never happens

- if ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() was never called (because
  ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of various
  reasons), shifting never happens

- if `processed_in_fbatch` is zero (because ceph_process_folio_batch()
  has returned early for some of the reasons mentioned above or
  because ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() has failed), shifting
  never happens

Since those two commits, any problem in ceph_process_folio_batch()
could crash the kernel, e.g. this way:

The crash can be reproduced easily by changing the
ceph_check_page_before_write() return value to `-E2BIG`.

(Interestingly, the crash happens only if `huge_zero_folio` has
already been allocated; without `huge_zero_folio`,
is_huge_zero_folio(NULL) returns true and folios_put_refs() skips NULL
entries instead of dereferencing them.  That makes reproducing the bug
somewhat unreliable.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/20250826231626.218675-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com
for a discussion of this detail.)

My suggestion is to move the ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() to right
after ceph_process_folio_batch() to ensure it always gets called to
fix up the illegal folio_batch state.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39880 | libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39880</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

On 64-bit systems, con-&gt;v1.auth_retry overlaps with con-&gt;v2.out_iter,
so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of
0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the
side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive
fetching of new tickets.

con-&gt;v1.connect_seq overlaps with con-&gt;v2.conn_bufs and the fact that
it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily
it's not something that happens often.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39881 | kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39881</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released

A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability was identified in the PSI (Pressure
Stall Information) monitoring mechanism:

Reproduction Steps:
1. Open test/cpu.pressure and establish epoll monitoring
2. Disable monitoring: echo 0 &gt; test/cgroup.pressure
3. Re-enable monitoring: echo 1 &gt; test/cgroup.pressure

The race condition occurs because:
1. When cgroup.pressure is disabled (echo 0 &gt; cgroup.pressure), it:
   - Releases PSI triggers via cgroup_file_release()
   - Frees of-&gt;priv through kernfs_drain_open_files()
2. While epoll still holds reference to the file and continues polling
3. Re-enabling (echo 1 &gt; cgroup.pressure) accesses freed of-&gt;priv

epolling			disable/enable cgroup.pressure
fd=open(cpu.pressure)
while(1)
...
epoll_wait
kernfs_fop_poll
kernfs_get_active = true	echo 0 &gt; cgroup.pressure
...				cgroup_file_show
				kernfs_show
				// inactive kn
				kernfs_drain_open_files
				cft-&gt;release(of);
				kfree(ctx);
				...
kernfs_get_active = false
				echo 1 &gt; cgroup.pressure
				kernfs_show
				kernfs_activate_one(kn);
kernfs_fop_poll
kernfs_get_active = true
cgroup_file_poll
psi_trigger_poll
// UAF
...
end: close(fd)

To address this issue, introduce kernfs_get_active_of() for kernfs open
files to obtain active references. This function will fail if the open file
has been released. Replace kernfs_get_active() with kernfs_get_active_of()
to prevent further operations on released file descriptors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39882 | drm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39882</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception ]---

The root cause is that unpoison_memory() tries to check the PG_HWPoison
flags of an uninitialized page.  So VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(page)) is
triggered.  This can be reproduced by below steps:

1.Offline memory block:

 echo offline &gt; /sys/devices/system/memory/memory12/state

2.Get offlined memory pfn:

 page-types -b n -rlN

3.Write pfn to unpoison-pfn

 echo  &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/hwpoison/unpoison-pfn

This scenario can be identified by pfn_to_online_page() returning NULL. 
And ZONE_DEVICE pages are never expected, so we can simply fail if
pfn_to_online_page() == NULL to fix the bug.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39884 | btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39884</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race

There is a race condition between inode eviction and inode caching that
can cause a live struct btrfs_inode to be missing from the root-&gt;inodes
xarray. Specifically, there is a window during evict() between the inode
being unhashed and deleted from the xarray. If btrfs_iget() is called
for the same inode in that window, it will be recreated and inserted
into the xarray, but then eviction will delete the new entry, leaving
nothing in the xarray:

Thread 1                          Thread 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
evict()
  remove_inode_hash()
                                  btrfs_iget_path()
                                    btrfs_iget_locked()
                                    btrfs_read_locked_inode()
                                      btrfs_add_inode_to_root()
  destroy_inode()
    btrfs_destroy_inode()
      btrfs_del_inode_from_root()
        __xa_erase

In turn, this can cause issues for subvolume deletion. Specifically, if
an inode is in this lost state, and all other inodes are evicted, then
btrfs_del_inode_from_root() will call btrfs_add_dead_root() prematurely.
If the lost inode has a delayed_node attached to it, then when
btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot() calls btrfs_kill_all_delayed_nodes(),
it will loop forever because the delayed_nodes xarray will never become
empty (unless memory pressure forces the inode out). We saw this
manifest as soft lockups in production.

Fix it by only deleting the xarray entry if it matches the given inode
(using __xa_cmpxchg()).</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39885 | ocfs2: fix recursive semaphore deadlock in fiemap call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39885</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2_fiemap() takes a read lock of the ip_alloc_sem semaphore (since
v2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the
extent list of this running mmap executable.  The user supplied buffer to
hold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which
will take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same
semaphore.  This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes
a hang of the fileystem.

The ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size.  Release the
read semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap()
and ocfs2_fiemap_inline().  This does an unnecessary semaphore lock/unlock
on the last extent but simplifies the error path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39886 | bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39886</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The above was reproduced on bpf-next (b338cf849ec8) by modifying
./tools/sched_ext/scx_flatcg.bpf.c to call bpf_timer_init() during
ops.runnable(), and hacking the memcg accounting code a bit to make
a bpf_timer_init() call more likely to raise an MEMCG_MAX event.

We have also run into other similar variants (both internally and on
bpf-next), including double-acquiring cgroup_file_kn_lock, the same
worker_pool::lock, etc.

As suggested by Shakeel, fix this by using __GFP_HIGH instead of
GFP_ATOMIC in __bpf_async_init(), so that e.g. if try_charge_memcg()
raises an MEMCG_MAX event, we call __memcg_memory_event() with
@allow_spinning=false and avoid calling cgroup_file_notify() there.

This issue can be reproduced by below code:

fd=open("/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/osnoise/cpus", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "0-2", 0);

When user pass 'count=0' to osnoise_cpus_write(), kmalloc() will return
ZERO_SIZE_PTR (16) and cpulist_parse() treat it as a normal value, which
trigger the null pointer dereference. Add check for the parameter 'count'.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39888 | fuse: Block access to folio overlimit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39888</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
