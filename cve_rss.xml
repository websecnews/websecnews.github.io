The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that
takes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that "an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of
the base file". However, when the path contains encoded ".."
characters (for example, "%2E%2E/bar.txt"), it might return file objects that are not
a descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.
This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:25:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2691 | Versions of the package nossrf before 1.0.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker can provide a hostname th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2691</link><description>Versions of the package nossrf before 1.0.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker can provide a hostname that resolves to a local or reserved IP address space and bypass the SSRF protection mechanism.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30474 | Apache Commons VFS: Failing to find an FTP file can reveal the URI&amp;#x27;s password in an error message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30474</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS.

Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29640 | Phpgurukul Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) ‚Äì Testing Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /patient-report.php via the param...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29640</link><description>Phpgurukul Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) ‚Äì Testing Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /patient-report.php via the parameter searchdata..</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30157 | Envoy crashes when HTTP ext_proc processes local replies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30157</link><description>Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy.

When submitting descriptions such as Moderator Notes or Agenda Topics, an editor is shown that allows one to format the submitted text. This allows insertion of various HTML elements. When trying to insert a SCRIPT element, it is properly encoded when reflected; however, adding attributes to links is possible, which allows the injection of JavaScript via the onmouseover attribute and others. When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link, JavaScript is executed in that user's session.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:57:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30343 | A directory traversal issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5.

Files can be uploaded to OpenSlides meetings and organized in folders. The interface allows users to download a ZIP archive that contains all files in a folder and its subfolders. If an attacker specifies the title of a file or folder as a relative or absolute path (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd), the ZIP archive generated for download converts that title into a path. Depending on the extraction tool used by the user, this might overwrite files locally outside of the chosen directory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:57:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30344 | An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5.

When creating new chats via the chat_group.create action, the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements such as SCRIPT are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, HTML entities are encoded properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website, but it is unlikely that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:49:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2581 | xmedcon DICOM File malloc integer underflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2581</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in xmedcon 0.25.0 and classified as problematic.
