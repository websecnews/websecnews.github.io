Starting in the 7.x branch and prior to versions 13.4.2 and 15.1.2, the 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address, potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems. This issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2. Unpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the `Send email with template (Razor)` workflow instead or writing a custom workflow type. To avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using a composer available in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:12:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36339 | A DLL hijacking vulnerability in the AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries could allow an attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially resul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36339</link><description>A DLL hijacking vulnerability in the AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries could allow an attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:12:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6364 | Server Identity Validation Bypass in Absolute Persistence®</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6364</link><description>A vulnerability in Absolute Persistence® versions before 2.8 exists when it is not activated.

In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 16:19:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45857 | EDIMAX CV7428NS v1.20 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the command parameter in the mp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45857</link><description>EDIMAX CV7428NS v1.20 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the command parameter in the mp function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4427 | Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4427</link><description>An authentication bypass in the API component of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile 12.5.0.0 and prior allows attackers to access protected resources without proper credentials via the API.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4428 | Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4428</link><description>Remote Code Execution in API component in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile 12.5.0.0 and prior on unspecified platforms allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted API requests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47276 | Actualizer Uses OpenSSL&amp;#x27;s  &amp;quot;-passwd&amp;quot; Function Which Uses SHA512 Under The Hood Instead of Proper Password Hasher like Yescript/Argon2i</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47276</link><description>Actualizer is a single shell script solution to allow developers and embedded engineers to create Debian operating systems (OS). Prior to version 1.2.0, Actualizer uses OpenSSL's  "-passwd" function, which uses SHA512 instead of a more suitable password hasher like Yescript/Argon2i. All Actualizer users building a full Debian Operating System are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.2.0 of Actualizer. Existing OS deployment requires manual password changes against the alpha and root accounts. The change will deploy's Debian's yescript overriding the older SHA512 hash created by OpenSSL.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby-&gt;collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby-&gt;collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have added a check for the collection path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured collections root. Collection paths that point outside of the collections root will not be loaded.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45858 | TOTOLINK A3002R v4.0.0-B20230531.1404 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the FUN_00459fdc function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45858</link><description>TOTOLINK A3002R v4.0.0-B20230531.1404 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the FUN_00459fdc function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46721 | nosurf vulnerable to CSRF due to non-functional same-origin request checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46721</link><description>nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48766 | NetAlertX 24.7.18 before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated file reading because an HTTP client can ignore a redirect, and because of factors r...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48766</link><description>NetAlertX 24.7.18 before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated file reading because an HTTP client can ignore a redirect, and because of factors related to strpos and directory traversal.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby setups that use PHP's built-in server. Such setups are commonly only used during local development. Sites that use other server software (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine whether the file exists or not.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22460 | Default credentials in Ivanti Cloud Services Application before version 5.0.5 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22460</link><description>Default credentials in Ivanti Cloud Services Application before version 5.0.5 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28057 | owl-admin v3.2.2~ to v4.10.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /admin-api/system/admin_menus/save_order.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28057</link><description>owl-admin v3.2.2~ to v4.10.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /admin-api/system/admin_menus/save_order.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30159 | Kirby vulnerable to path traversal of snippet names in the `snippet()` helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30159</link><description>Kirby is an open-source content management system.

Due to the ordering of code used to start an MCP server container, versions of ToolHive prior to 0.0.33 inadvertently store secrets in the run config files which are used to restart stopped containers. This means that an attacker who has access to the home folder of the user who starts the MCP server can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself. This only applies to secrets which were used in containers whose run configs exist at a point in time - other secrets remaining inaccessible. ToolHive 0.0.33 fixes the issue. Some workarounds are available. Stop and delete any running MCP servers, or manually remove any runconfigs from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/toolhive/runconfigs/` (macOS) or `$HOME/.state/toolhive/runconfigs/` (Linux).</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:25:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56523 | Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by placing random data in ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56523</link><description>Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by placing random data in the HTTP request body when using the HTTP GET method.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56524 | Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by adding a special charac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56524</link><description>Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) before 2025-05-07 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall filters by adding a special character to the request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46717 | sudo-rs Allows Low Privilege Users to Discover the Existence of Files in Inaccessible Folders</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46717</link><description>sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory.

The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:53:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32390 | EspoCRM vulnerable to HTML Injection into phishing, which may lead to account takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32390</link><description>EspoCRM is a free, open-source customer relationship management platform.
