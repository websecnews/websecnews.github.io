Prior to versions 6.3.6, 7.0.4, 7.1.3, 7.2.2, and 7.3, due to a missing permission check on the preview endpoints, a user with access to the Wagtail admin and knowledge of a model's fields can craft a form submission to obtain a preview rendering of any page, snippet or site setting object for which previews are enabled, consisting of any data of the user's choosing. The existing data of the object itself is not exposed, but depending on the nature of the template being rendered, this may expose other database contents that would otherwise only be accessible to users with edit access over the model. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. This issue has been patched in versions 6.3.6, 7.0.4, 7.1.3, 7.2.2, and 7.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:02:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25519 | OpenSlides has incorrect access control vulnerability in authentication service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25519</link><description>OpenSlides is a free, web based presentation and assembly system for managing and projecting agenda, motions and elections of an assembly.

Prior to version 0.59.32, there is a bypass to the fix for CVE-2025-46724. TableChatAgent can call pandas_eval tool to evaluate the expression. There is a WAF in langroid/utils/pandas_utils.py introduced to block code injection CVE-2025-46724. However it can be bypassed due to _literal_ok() returning False instead of raising UnsafeCommandError on invalid input, combined with unrestricted access to dangerous dunder attributes (__init__, __globals__, __builtins__). This allows chaining whitelisted DataFrame methods to leak the eval builtin and execute arbitrary code.

Prior to version 2026.1.29, there is an OS command injection vulnerability via the Project Root Path in sshNodeCommand. The sshNodeCommand function constructed a shell script without properly escaping the user-supplied project path in an error message. When the cd command failed, the unescaped path was interpolated directly into an echo statement, allowing arbitrary command execution on the remote SSH host. The parseSSHTarget function did not validate that SSH target strings could not begin with a dash. An attacker-supplied target like -oProxyCommand=... would be interpreted as an SSH configuration flag rather than a hostname, allowing arbitrary command execution on the local machine. This issue has been patched in version 2026.1.29.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 20:33:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25475 | OpenClaw Vulnerable to Local File Inclusion via MEDIA: Path Extraction</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25475</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant.

In version 2.0.0 and 1.10.3 and prior, Compressing extracts TAR archives while restoring symbolic links without validating their targets. By embedding symlinks that resolve outside the intended extraction directory, an attacker can cause subsequent file entries to be written to arbitrary locations on the host file system. Depending on the extractor’s handling of existing files, this behavior may allow overwriting sensitive files or creating new files in security-critical locations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.10.4 and 2.0.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:56:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25143 | melange affected by potential host command execution via license-check YAML mode patch pipeline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25143</link><description>melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version 0.10.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could execute arbitrary shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml embeds input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters) into shell scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters to break out of their intended context. The vulnerability affects the built-in patch pipeline which can be invoked through melange build and melange license-check operations. An attacker who can control patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull request-driven CI, build-as-a-service, or by influencing melange configurations) can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks, command substitutions $(…), semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the melange build process.

From version 0.14.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence a melange configuration file (e.g., through pull request-driven CI or build-as-a-service scenarios) could read arbitrary files from the host system. The LicensingInfos function in pkg/config/config.go reads license files specified in copyright[].license-path without validating that paths remain within the workspace directory, allowing path traversal via ../ sequences. The contents of the traversed file are embedded into the generated SBOM as license text, enabling exfiltration of sensitive data through build artifacts.

In version 0.24.6, NanoMQ has a protocol parsing / forwarding inconsistency when handling shared subscriptions ($share/). A malformed SUBSCRIBE topic such as $share/ab (missing the second /) is not strictly validated during the subscription stage, so the invalid Topic Filter is stored into the subscription table. Later, when any PUBLISH matches this subscription, the broker send path (nmq_pipe_send_start_v4/v5) performs a second $share/ parsing using strchr() and increments the returned pointer without NULL checks. If the second strchr() returns NULL, sub_topic++ turns the pointer into an invalid address (e.g. 0x1). This invalid pointer is then passed into topic_filtern(), which triggers strlen() and crashes with SIGSEGV. The crash is stable and remotely triggerable.

From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.0, expandapk.Split drains the first gzip stream of an APK archive via io.Copy(io.Discard, gzi) without explicit bounds. With an attacker-controlled input stream, this can force large gzip inflation work and lead to resource exhaustion (availability impact). The Split function reads the first tar header, then drains the remainder of the gzip stream by reading from the gzip reader directly without any maximum uncompressed byte limit or inflate-ratio cap. A caller that parses attacker-controlled APK streams may be forced to spend excessive CPU time inflating gzip data, leading to timeouts or process slowdown.

In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, a use-after-free vulnerability was reported in the BLE provisioning transport (protocomm_ble) layer. The issue can be triggered by a remote BLE client while the device is in provisioning mode. The vulnerability occurred when provisioning was stopped with keep_ble_on = true. In this configuration, internal protocomm_ble state and GATT metadata were freed while the BLE stack and GATT services remained active. Subsequent BLE read or write callbacks dereferenced freed memory, allowing a connected or newly connected client to trigger invalid memory acces.

In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability was reported in the BLE ATT Prepare Write handling of the BLE provisioning transport (protocomm_ble). The issue can be triggered by a remote BLE client while the device is in provisioning mode. The transport accumulated prepared-write fragments in a fixed-size buffer but incorrectly tracked the cumulative length. By sending repeated prepare write requests with overlapping offsets, a remote client could cause the reported length to exceed the allocated buffer size. This inflated length was then passed to provisioning handlers during execute-write processing, resulting in an out-of-bounds read and potential memory corruption.

In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, a vulnerability exists in the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) Enrollee implementation where malformed EAP-WSC packets with truncated payloads can cause integer underflow during fragment length calculation. When processing EAP-Expanded (WSC) messages, the code computes frag_len by subtracting header sizes from the total packet length. If an attacker sends a packet where the EAP Length field covers only the header and flags but omits the expected payload (such as the 2-byte Message Length field when WPS_MSG_FLAG_LEN is set), frag_len becomes negative. This negative value is then implicitly cast to size_t when passed to wpabuf_put_data(), resulting in a very large unsigned value.

phy: qcom-qusb2: Fix NULL pointer dereference on early suspend

Enabling runtime PM before attaching the QPHY instance as driver data
can lead to a NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM callbacks that
expect valid driver data. There is a small window where the suspend
callback may run after PM runtime enabling and before runtime forbid.
This causes a sporadic crash during boot:

```
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000a1

lr : pm_generic_runtime_suspend+0x2c/0x44
[...]
```

Attach the QPHY instance as driver data before enabling runtime PM to
prevent NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM callbacks.

Reorder pm_runtime_enable() and pm_runtime_forbid() to prevent a
short window where an unnecessary runtime suspend can occur.

Use the devres-managed version to ensure PM runtime is symmetrically
disabled during driver removal for proper cleanup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71194 | btrfs: fix deadlock in wait_current_trans() due to ignored transaction type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71194</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix deadlock in wait_current_trans() due to ignored transaction type

When wait_current_trans() is called during start_transaction(), it
currently waits for a blocked transaction without considering whether
the given transaction type actually needs to wait for that particular
transaction state. The btrfs_blocked_trans_types[] array already defines
which transaction types should wait for which transaction states, but
this check was missing in wait_current_trans().

This can lead to a deadlock scenario involving two transactions and
pending ordered extents:

  1. Transaction A is in TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING state

  2. A worker processing an ordered extent calls start_transaction()
     with TRANS_JOIN

  3. join_transaction() returns -EBUSY because Transaction A is in
     TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING

  4. Transaction A moves to TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED and completes

  5. A new Transaction B is created (TRANS_STATE_RUNNING)

  6. The ordered extent from step 2 is added to Transaction B's
     pending ordered extents

  7. Transaction B immediately starts commit by another task and
     enters TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START

  8. The worker finally reaches wait_current_trans(), sees Transaction B
     in TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START (a blocked state), and waits
     unconditionally

  9. However, TRANS_JOIN should NOT wait for TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START
     according to btrfs_blocked_trans_types[]

  10. Transaction B is waiting for pending ordered extents to complete

  11. Deadlock: Transaction B waits for ordered extent, ordered extent
      waits for Transaction B

This can be illustrated by the following call stacks:
  CPU0                              CPU1
                                    btrfs_finish_ordered_io()
                                      start_transaction(TRANS_JOIN)
                                        join_transaction()
                                          # -EBUSY (Transaction A is
                                          # TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING)
  # Transaction A completes
  # Transaction B created
  # ordered extent added to
  # Transaction B's pending list
  btrfs_commit_transaction()
    # Transaction B enters
    # TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START
    # waiting for pending ordered
    # extents
                                        wait_current_trans()
                                          # waits for Transaction B
                                          # (should not wait!)

Fix this by passing the transaction type to wait_current_trans() and
checking btrfs_blocked_trans_types[cur_trans-&gt;state] against the given
type before deciding to wait. This ensures that transaction types which
are allowed to join during certain blocked states will not unnecessarily
wait and cause deadlocks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71195 | dmaengine: xilinx: xdma: Fix regmap max_register</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71195</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: stm32-usphyc: Fix off by one in probe()

The "index" variable is used as an index into the usbphyc-&gt;phys[] array
which has usbphyc-&gt;nphys elements.  So if it is equal to usbphyc-&gt;nphys
then it is one element out of bounds.  The "index" comes from the
device tree so it's data that we trust and it's unlikely to be wrong,
however it's obviously still worth fixing the bug.  Change the &gt; to &gt;=.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71197 | w1: therm: Fix off-by-one buffer overflow in alarms_store</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71197</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

w1: therm: Fix off-by-one buffer overflow in alarms_store

The sysfs buffer passed to alarms_store() is allocated with 'size + 1'
bytes and a NUL terminator is appended. However, the 'size' argument
does not account for this extra byte. The original code then allocated
'size' bytes and used strcpy() to copy 'buf', which always writes one
byte past the allocated buffer since strcpy() copies until the NUL
terminator at index 'size'.

Fix this by parsing the 'buf' parameter directly using simple_strtoll()
without allocating any intermediate memory or string copying. This
removes the overflow while simplifying the code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71198 | iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71198</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection

The st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels array of struct iio_chan_spec has a non-NULL
event_spec field, indicating support for IIO events. However, event
detection is not supported for all sensors, and if userspace tries to
configure accelerometer wakeup events on a sensor device that does not
support them (e.g. LSM6DS0), st_lsm6dsx_write_event() dereferences a NULL
pointer when trying to write to the wakeup register.
Define an additional struct iio_chan_spec array whose members have a NULL
event_spec field, and use this array instead of st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels for
sensors without event detection capability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71199 | iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: Fix potential use-after-free in sama5d2_adc driver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71199</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: Fix potential use-after-free in sama5d2_adc driver

at91_adc_interrupt can call at91_adc_touch_data_handler function
to start the work by schedule_work(&amp;amp;st-&gt;touch_st.workq).

If we remove the module which will call at91_adc_remove to
make cleanup, it will free indio_dev through iio_device_unregister but
quite a bit later. While the work mentioned above will be used. The
sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                      CPU1

                                     | at91_adc_workq_handler

                                     | //use indio_dev

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with
the cleanup in at91_adc_remove.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0538 | GIF File Parsing Out-of-Bounds Write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0538</link><description>A maliciously crafted GIF file, when parsed through Autodesk 3ds Max, can force an Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability.

The issue is that the delegreturn is being asked to wait for a layout
return that cannot complete because a state recovery was initiated. The
state recovery cannot complete until the open() finishes processing the
delegations it was given.

The solution is to propagate the existing flags that indicate a
non-blocking call to the function pnfs_roc(), so that it knows not to
wait in this situation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23051 | drm/amdgpu: fix drm panic null pointer when driver not support atomic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23051</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Do not over-allocate ftrace memory

The pg_remaining calculation in ftrace_process_locs() assumes that
ENTRIES_PER_PAGE multiplied by 2^order equals the actual capacity of the
allocated page group. However, ENTRIES_PER_PAGE is PAGE_SIZE / ENTRY_SIZE
(integer division). When PAGE_SIZE is not a multiple of ENTRY_SIZE (e.g.
4096 / 24 = 170 with remainder 16), high-order allocations (like 256 pages)
have significantly more capacity than 256 * 170. This leads to pg_remaining
being underestimated, which in turn makes skip (derived from skipped -
pg_remaining) larger than expected, causing the WARN(skip != remaining)
to trigger.

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/trace/ftrace.c:7295 ftrace_process_locs+0x5bf/0x5e0

A similar problem in ftrace_allocate_records() can result in allocating

Use the actual capacity of a page group to determine the number of pages
to allocate. Have ftrace_allocate_pages() return the number of allocated
pages to avoid having to calculate it. Use the actual page group capacity
when validating the number of unused pages due to skipped entries.

The warning is triggered because I2C transfers can still be attempted
while the controller is already suspended, due to inappropriate ordering
of the system sleep callbacks.

If the controller is autosuspended, there is no way to wake it up once
runtime PM disabled (in suspend_late()). During system resume, the I2C
controller will be available only after runtime PM is re-enabled
(in resume_early()). However, this may be too late for some devices.

Wake up the controller in the suspend() callback while runtime PM is
still enabled. The I2C controller will remain available until the
suspend_noirq() callback (pm_runtime_force_suspend()) is called. During
resume, the I2C controller can be restored by the resume_noirq() callback
(pm_runtime_force_resume()). Finally, the resume() callback re-enables
autosuspend. As a result, the I2C controller can remain available until
the system enters suspend_noirq() and from resume_noirq().</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23056 | uacce: implement mremap in uacce_vm_ops to return -EPERM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23056</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: implement mremap in uacce_vm_ops to return -EPERM

The current uacce_vm_ops does not support the mremap operation of
vm_operations_struct. Implement .mremap to return -EPERM to remind
users.

The reason we need to explicitly disable mremap is that when the
driver does not implement .mremap, it uses the default mremap
method. This could lead to a risk scenario:

An application might first mmap address p1, then mremap to p2,
followed by munmap(p1), and finally munmap(p2). Since the default
mremap copies the original vma's vm_private_data (i.e., q) to the
new vma, both munmap operations would trigger vma_close, causing
q-&gt;qfr to be freed twice(qfr will be set to null here, so repeated
release is ok).</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23057 | vsock/virtio: Coalesce only linear skb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23057</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: Coalesce only linear skb

vsock/virtio common tries to coalesce buffers in rx queue: if a linear skb
(with a spare tail room) is followed by a small skb (length limited by
GOOD_COPY_LEN = 128), an attempt is made to join them.

Since the introduction of MSG_ZEROCOPY support, assumption that a small skb
will always be linear is incorrect. In the zerocopy case, data is lost and
the linear skb is appended with uninitialized kernel memory.

Of all 3 supported virtio-based transports, only loopback-transport is

scsi: qla2xxx: Sanitize payload size to prevent member overflow

In qla27xx_copy_fpin_pkt() and qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), the frame_size
reported by firmware is used to calculate the copy length into
item-&gt;iocb. However, the iocb member is defined as a fixed-size 64-byte
array within struct purex_item.

If the reported frame_size exceeds 64 bytes, subsequent memcpy calls will
overflow the iocb member boundary. While extra memory might be allocated,
this cross-member write is unsafe and triggers warnings under
CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

Fix this by capping total_bytes to the size of the iocb member (64 bytes)
before allocation and copying. This ensures all copies remain within the
bounds of the destination structure member.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23060 | crypto: authencesn - reject too-short AAD (assoclen&amp;lt;8) to match ESP/ESN spec</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23060</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: ensure safe queue release with state management

Directly calling `put_queue` carries risks since it cannot
guarantee that resources of `uacce_queue` have been fully released
beforehand. So adding a `stop_queue` operation for the
UACCE_CMD_PUT_Q command and leaving the `put_queue` operation to
the final resource release ensures safety.

Queue states are defined as follows:
- UACCE_Q_ZOMBIE: Initial state
- UACCE_Q_INIT: After opening `uacce`
- UACCE_Q_STARTED: After `start` is issued via `ioctl`

When executing `poweroff -f` in virt while accelerator are still
working, `uacce_fops_release` and `uacce_remove` may execute
concurrently. This can cause `uacce_put_queue` within
`uacce_fops_release` to access a NULL `ops` pointer. Therefore, add
state checks to prevent accessing freed pointers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23064 | net/sched: act_ife: avoid possible NULL deref</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23064</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix recvmsg() unconditional requeue

If rxrpc_recvmsg() fails because MSG_DONTWAIT was specified but the call at
the front of the recvmsg queue already has its mutex locked, it requeues
the call - whether or not the call is already queued.  The call may be on
the queue because MSG_PEEK was also passed and so the call was not dequeued
or because the I/O thread requeued it.

The unconditional requeue may then corrupt the recvmsg queue, leading to
things like UAFs or refcount underruns.

Fix this by only requeuing the call if it isn't already on the queue - and
moving it to the front if it is already queued.  If we don't queue it, we
have to put the ref we obtained by dequeuing it.

Also, MSG_PEEK doesn't dequeue the call so shouldn't call
rxrpc_notify_socket() for the call if we didn't use up all the data on the
queue, so fix that also.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23067 | iommu/io-pgtable-arm: fix size_t signedness bug in unmap path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23067</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/io-pgtable-arm: fix size_t signedness bug in unmap path

__arm_lpae_unmap() returns size_t but was returning -ENOENT (negative
error code) when encountering an unmapped PTE. Since size_t is unsigned,
-ENOENT (typically -2) becomes a huge positive value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE
on 64-bit systems).

This corrupted value propagates through the call chain:
  __arm_lpae_unmap() returns -ENOENT as size_t
  -&gt; arm_lpae_unmap_pages() returns it
  -&gt; __iommu_unmap() adds it to iova address
  -&gt; iommu_pgsize() triggers BUG_ON due to corrupted iova

This can cause IOVA address overflow in __iommu_unmap() loop and
trigger BUG_ON in iommu_pgsize() from invalid address alignment.

Fix by returning 0 instead of -ENOENT. The WARN_ON already signals
the error condition, and returning 0 (meaning "nothing unmapped")
is the correct semantic for size_t return type. This matches the
behavior of other io-pgtable implementations (io-pgtable-arm-v7s,
io-pgtable-dart) which return 0 on error conditions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23068 | spi: spi-sprd-adi: Fix double free in probe error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23068</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-sprd-adi: Fix double free in probe error path

The driver currently uses spi_alloc_host() to allocate the controller
but registers it using devm_spi_register_controller().

If devm_register_restart_handler() fails, the code jumps to the
put_ctlr label and calls spi_controller_put(). However, since the
controller was registered via a devm function, the device core will
automatically call spi_controller_put() again when the probe fails.
This results in a double-free of the spi_controller structure.

Fix this by switching to devm_spi_alloc_host() and removing the
manual spi_controller_put() call.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23069 | vsock/virtio: fix potential underflow in virtio_transport_get_credit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23069</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The credit calculation in virtio_transport_get_credit() uses unsigned
arithmetic:

  ret = vvs-&gt;peer_buf_alloc - (vvs-&gt;tx_cnt - vvs-&gt;peer_fwd_cnt);

If the peer shrinks its advertised buffer (peer_buf_alloc) while bytes
are in flight, the subtraction can underflow and produce a large
positive value, potentially allowing more data to be queued than the
peer can handle.

Reuse virtio_transport_has_space() which already handles this case and

wifi: rsi: Fix memory corruption due to not set vif driver data size

The struct ieee80211_vif contains trailing space for vif driver data,
when struct ieee80211_vif is allocated, the total memory size that is
allocated is sizeof(struct ieee80211_vif) + size of vif driver data.
The size of vif driver data is set by each WiFi driver as needed.

The RSI911x driver does not set vif driver data size, no trailing space
for vif driver data is therefore allocated past struct ieee80211_vif .
The RSI911x driver does however use the vif driver data to store its
vif driver data structure "struct vif_priv". An access to vif-&gt;drv_priv
leads to access out of struct ieee80211_vif bounds and corruption of
some memory.

In case of the failure observed locally, rsi_mac80211_add_interface()
would write struct vif_priv *vif_info = (struct vif_priv *)vif-&gt;drv_priv;
vif_info-&gt;vap_id = vap_idx. This write corrupts struct fq_tin member
struct list_head new_flows . The flow = list_first_entry(head, struct
fq_flow, flowchain); in fq_tin_reset() then reports non-NULL bogus
address, which when accessed causes a crash.

The trigger is very simple, boot the machine with init=/bin/sh , mount
devtmpfs, sysfs, procfs, and then do "ip link set wlan0 up", "sleep 1",
"ip link set wlan0 down" and the crash occurs.

Fix this by setting the correct size of vif driver data, which is the
size of "struct vif_priv", so that memory is allocated and the driver
can store its driver data in it, instead of corrupting memory around
it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23074 | net/sched: Enforce that teql can only be used as root qdisc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23074</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Enforce that teql can only be used as root qdisc

Design intent of teql is that it is only supposed to be used as root qdisc.
We need to check for that constraint.

Although not important, I will describe the scenario that unearthed this
issue for the curious.

GangMin Kim  managed to concot a scenario as follows:

ROOT qdisc 1:0 (QFQ)
  ├── class 1:1 (weight=15, lmax=16384) netem with delay 6.4s
  └── class 1:2 (weight=1, lmax=1514) teql

GangMin sends a packet which is enqueued to 1:1 (netem).
Any invocation of dequeue by QFQ from this class will not return a packet
until after 6.4s. In the meantime, a second packet is sent and it lands on
1:2. teql's enqueue will return success and this will activate class 1:2.
Main issue is that teql only updates the parent visible qlen (sch-&gt;q.qlen)
at dequeue. Since QFQ will only call dequeue if peek succeeds (and teql's
peek always returns NULL), dequeue will never be called and thus the qlen
will remain as 0. With that in mind, when GangMin updates 1:2's lmax value,
the qfq_change_class calls qfq_deact_rm_from_agg. Since the child qdisc's
qlen was not incremented, qfq fails to deactivate the class, but still
frees its pointers from the aggregate. So when the first packet is
rescheduled after 6.4 seconds (netem's delay), a dangling pointer is
accessed causing GangMin's causing a UAF.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23075 | can: esd_usb: esd_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23075</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vma: fix anon_vma UAF on mremap() faulted, unfaulted merge

Patch series "mm/vma: fix anon_vma UAF on mremap() faulted, unfaulted
merge", v2.

Commit 879bca0a2c4f ("mm/vma: fix incorrectly disallowed anonymous VMA
merges") introduced the ability to merge previously unavailable VMA merge
scenarios.

However, it is handling merges incorrectly when it comes to mremap() of a
faulted VMA adjacent to an unfaulted VMA.  The issues arise in three
cases:

1. Previous VMA unfaulted:

              copied -----|
                          v
	|-----------|.............|
	| unfaulted |(faulted VMA)|
	|-----------|.............|
	     prev

2. Next VMA unfaulted:

              copied -----|
                          v
	            |.............|-----------|
	            |(faulted VMA)| unfaulted |
                    |.............|-----------|
		                      next

3. Both adjacent VMAs unfaulted:

              copied -----|
                          v
	|-----------|.............|-----------|
	| unfaulted |(faulted VMA)| unfaulted |
	|-----------|.............|-----------|
	     prev                      next

This series fixes each of these cases, and introduces self tests to assert
that the issues are corrected.

I also test a further case which was already handled, to assert that my
changes continues to correctly handle it:

4. prev unfaulted, next faulted:

              copied -----|
                          v
	|-----------|.............|-----------|
	| unfaulted |(faulted VMA)|  faulted  |
	|-----------|.............|-----------|
	     prev                      next

This bug was discovered via a syzbot report, linked to in the first patch
in the series, I confirmed that this series fixes the bug.

I also discovered that we are failing to check that the faulted VMA was
not forked when merging a copied VMA in cases 1-3 above, an issue this
series also addresses.

I also added self tests to assert that this is resolved (and confirmed
that the tests failed prior to this).

I also cleaned up vma_expand() as part of this work, renamed
vma_had_uncowed_parents() to vma_is_fork_child() as the previous name was
unduly confusing, and simplified the comments around this function.


This patch (of 4):

Commit 879bca0a2c4f ("mm/vma: fix incorrectly disallowed anonymous VMA
merges") introduced the ability to merge previously unavailable VMA merge
scenarios.

The key piece of logic introduced was the ability to merge a faulted VMA
immediately next to an unfaulted VMA, which relies upon dup_anon_vma() to
correctly handle anon_vma state.

In the case of the merge of an existing VMA (that is changing properties
of a VMA and then merging if those properties are shared by adjacent
VMAs), dup_anon_vma() is invoked correctly.

However in the case of the merge of a new VMA, a corner case peculiar to
mremap() was missed.

The issue is that vma_expand() only performs dup_anon_vma() if the target
(the VMA that will ultimately become the merged VMA): is not the next VMA,
i.e.  the one that appears after the range in which the new VMA is to be
established.

A key insight here is that in all other cases other than mremap(), a new
VMA merge either expands an existing VMA, meaning that the target VMA will
be that VMA, or would have anon_vma be NULL.

Specifically:

* __mmap_region() - no anon_vma in place, initial mapping.
* do_brk_flags() - expanding an existing VMA.
* vma_merge_extend() - expanding an existing VMA.
* relocate_vma_down() - no anon_vma in place, initial mapping.

In addition, we are in the unique situation of needing to duplicate
anon_vma state from a VMA that is neither the previous or next VMA being
merged with.

dup_anon_vma() deals exclusively with the target=unfaulted, src=faulted
case.  This leaves four possibilities, in each case where the copied VMA
is faulted:

1. Previous VMA unfaulted:

ALSA: scarlett2: Fix buffer overflow in config retrieval

The scarlett2_usb_get_config() function has a logic error in the
endianness conversion code that can cause buffer overflows when
count &gt; 1.

The code checks `if (size == 2)` where `size` is the total buffer size in
bytes, then loops `count` times treating each element as u16 (2 bytes).
This causes the loop to access `count * 2` bytes when the buffer only
has `size` bytes allocated.

Fix by checking the element size (config_item-&gt;size) instead of the
total buffer size. This ensures the endianness conversion matches the
actual element type.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23079 | gpio: cdev: Fix resource leaks on errors in lineinfo_changed_notify()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23079</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In mcba_usb_probe() -&gt; mcba_usb_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are
allocated, added to the priv-&gt;rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the
complete callback mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and
resubmitted. In mcba_usb_close() -&gt; mcba_urb_unlink() the URBs are freed by
calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&amp;amp;priv-&gt;rx_submitted).

However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
released in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Avoid truncating memory addresses

On 32-bit machines with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, it is possible for lowmem
allocations to be backed by addresses physical memory above the 32-bit
address limit, as found while experimenting with larger VMSPLIT
configurations.

This caused the qemu virt model to crash in the GICv3 driver, which
allocates the 'itt' object using GFP_KERNEL. Since all memory below
the 4GB physical address limit is in ZONE_DMA in this configuration,
kmalloc() defaults to higher addresses for ZONE_NORMAL, and the
ITS driver stores the physical address in a 32-bit 'unsigned long'
variable.

Change the itt_addr variable to the correct phys_addr_t type instead,
along with all other variables in this driver that hold a physical
address.

The gicv5 driver correctly uses u64 variables, while all other irqchip
drivers don't call virt_to_phys or similar interfaces. It's expected that
other device drivers have similar issues, but fixing this one is
sufficient for booting a virtio based guest.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23086 | vsock/virtio: cap TX credit to local buffer size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23086</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: cap TX credit to local buffer size

The virtio transports derives its TX credit directly from peer_buf_alloc,
which is set from the remote endpoint's SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE value.

On the host side this means that the amount of data we are willing to
queue for a connection is scaled by a guest-chosen buffer size, rather
than the host's own vsock configuration. A malicious guest can advertise
a large buffer and read slowly, causing the host to allocate a
correspondingly large amount of sk_buff memory.
The same thing would happen in the guest with a malicious host, since
virtio transports share the same code base.

Introduce a small helper, virtio_transport_tx_buf_size(), that
returns min(peer_buf_alloc, buf_alloc), and use it wherever we consume
peer_buf_alloc.

This ensures the effective TX window is bounded by both the peer's
advertised buffer and our own buf_alloc (already clamped to
buffer_max_size via SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE), so a remote peer
cannot force the other to queue more data than allowed by its own
vsock settings.

On an unpatched Ubuntu 22.04 host (~64 GiB RAM), running a PoC with
32 guest vsock connections advertising 2 GiB each and reading slowly
drove Slab/SUnreclaim from ~0.5 GiB to ~57 GiB; the system only
recovered after killing the QEMU process. That said, if QEMU memory is
limited with cgroups, the maximum memory used will be limited.

With this patch applied:

  Before:
    MemFree:        ~61.6 GiB
    Slab:           ~142 MiB
    SUnreclaim:     ~117 MiB

  After 32 high-credit connections:
    MemFree:        ~61.5 GiB
    Slab:           ~178 MiB
    SUnreclaim:     ~152 MiB

Only ~35 MiB increase in Slab/SUnreclaim, no host OOM, and the guest
remains responsive.

Compatibility with non-virtio transports:

  - VMCI uses the AF_VSOCK buffer knobs to size its queue pairs per
    socket based on the local vsk-&gt;buffer_* values; the remote side
    cannot enlarge those queues beyond what the local endpoint
    configured.

  - Hyper-V's vsock transport uses fixed-size VMBus ring buffers and
    an MTU bound; there is no peer-controlled credit field comparable
    to peer_buf_alloc, and the remote endpoint cannot drive in-flight
    kernel memory above those ring sizes.

  - The loopback path reuses virtio_transport_common.c, so it
    naturally follows the same semantics as the virtio transport.

This change is limited to virtio_transport_common.c and thus affects
virtio-vsock, vhost-vsock, and loopback, bringing them in line with the
"remote window intersected with local policy" behaviour that VMCI and
Hyper-V already effectively have.

tracing: Fix crash on synthetic stacktrace field usage

When creating a synthetic event based on an existing synthetic event that
had a stacktrace field and the new synthetic event used that field a
kernel crash occurred:

 ~# cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 ~# echo 's:stack unsigned long stack[];' &gt; dynamic_events
 ~# echo 'hist:keys=prev_pid:s0=common_stacktrace if prev_state &amp; 3' &gt;&gt; events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
 ~# echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:s1=$s0:onmatch(sched.sched_switch).trace(stack,$s1)' &gt;&gt; events/sched/sched_switch/trigger

The above creates a synthetic event that takes a stacktrace when a task
schedules out in a non-running state and passes that stacktrace to the
sched_switch event when that task schedules back in. It triggers the
"stack" synthetic event that has a stacktrace as its field (called "stack").

 ~# echo 's:syscall_stack s64 id; unsigned long stack[];' &gt;&gt; dynamic_events
 ~# echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:s2=stack' &gt;&gt; events/synthetic/stack/trigger
 ~# echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:s3=$s2,i0=id:onmatch(synthetic.stack).trace(syscall_stack,$i0,$s3)' &gt;&gt; events/raw_syscalls/sys_exit/trigger

The above makes another synthetic event called "syscall_stack" that
attaches the first synthetic event (stack) to the sys_exit trace event and
records the stacktrace from the stack event with the id of the system call
that is exiting.

When enabling this event (or using it in a historgram):

 ~# echo 1 &gt; events/synthetic/syscall_stack/enable

Produces a kernel crash!

iio: dac: ad3552r-hs: fix out-of-bound write in ad3552r_hs_write_data_source

When simple_write_to_buffer() succeeds, it returns the number of bytes
actually copied to the buffer. The code incorrectly uses 'count'
as the index for null termination instead of the actual bytes copied.
If count exceeds the buffer size, this leads to out-of-bounds write.
Add a check for the count and use the return value as the index.

The bug was validated using a demo module that mirrors the original
code and was tested under QEMU.

Pattern of the bug:
- A fixed 64-byte stack buffer is filled using count.
- If count &gt; 64, the code still does buf[count] = '\0', causing an
- out-of-bounds write on the stack.

Steps for reproduce:
- Opens the device node.
- Writes 128 bytes of A to it.
- This overflows the 64-byte stack buffer and KASAN reports the OOB.

Found via static analysis. This is similar to the
commit da9374819eb3 ("iio: backend: fix out-of-bound write")</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23093 | ksmbd: smbd: fix dma_unmap_sg() nents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23093</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: fix isolate sysfs check condition

uacce supports the device isolation feature. If the driver
implements the isolate_err_threshold_read and
isolate_err_threshold_write callback functions, uacce will create
sysfs files now. Users can read and configure the isolation policy
through sysfs. Currently, sysfs files are created as long as either
isolate_err_threshold_read or isolate_err_threshold_write callback
functions are present.

However, accessing a non-existent callback function may cause the
system to crash. Therefore, intercept the creation of sysfs if
neither read nor write exists; create sysfs if either is supported,
but intercept unsupported operations at the call site.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23095 | gue: Fix skb memleak with inner IP protocol 0.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix hugetlb_pmd_shared()

Patch series "mm/hugetlb: fixes for PMD table sharing (incl.  using
mmu_gather)", v3.

One functional fix, one performance regression fix, and two related
comment fixes.

I cleaned up my prototype I recently shared [1] for the performance fix,
deferring most of the cleanups I had in the prototype to a later point. 
While doing that I identified the other things.

The goal of this patch set is to be backported to stable trees "fairly"
easily. At least patch #1 and #4.

Patch #1 fixes hugetlb_pmd_shared() not detecting any sharing
Patch #2 + #3 are simple comment fixes that patch #4 interacts with.
Patch #4 is a fix for the reported performance regression due to excessive
IPI broadcasts during fork()+exit().

The last patch is all about TLB flushes, IPIs and mmu_gather.
Read: complicated

There are plenty of cleanups in the future to be had + one reasonable
optimization on x86. But that's all out of scope for this series.

Runtime tested, with a focus on fixing the performance regression using
the original reproducer [2] on x86.


This patch (of 4):

We switched from (wrongly) using the page count to an independent shared
count.  Now, shared page tables have a refcount of 1 (excluding
speculative references) and instead use ptdesc-&gt;pt_share_count to identify
sharing.

We didn't convert hugetlb_pmd_shared(), so right now, we would never
detect a shared PMD table as such, because sharing/unsharing no longer
touches the refcount of a PMD table.

Page migration, like mbind() or migrate_pages() would allow for migrating
folios mapped into such shared PMD tables, even though the folios are not
exclusive.  In smaps we would account them as "private" although they are
"shared", and we would be wrongly setting the PM_MMAP_EXCLUSIVE in the
pagemap interface.

Fix it by properly using ptdesc_pmd_is_shared() in hugetlb_pmd_shared().</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23101 | leds: led-class: Only Add LED to leds_list when it is fully ready</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23101</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

leds: led-class: Only Add LED to leds_list when it is fully ready

Before this change the LED was added to leds_list before led_init_core()
gets called adding it the list before led_classdev.set_brightness_work gets
initialized.

This leaves a window where led_trigger_register() of a LED's default
trigger will call led_trigger_set() which calls led_set_brightness()
which in turn will end up queueing the *uninitialized*
led_classdev.set_brightness_work.

This race gets hit by the lenovo-thinkpad-t14s EC driver which registers
2 LEDs with a default trigger provided by snd_ctl_led.ko in quick
succession. The first led_classdev_register() causes an async modprobe of
snd_ctl_led to run and that async modprobe manages to exactly hit
the window where the second LED is on the leds_list without led_init_core()
being called for it, resulting in:

arm64/fpsimd: signal: Fix restoration of SVE context

When SME is supported, Restoring SVE signal context can go wrong in a
few ways, including placing the task into an invalid state where the
kernel may read from out-of-bounds memory (and may potentially take a
fatal fault) and/or may kill the task with a SIGKILL.

(1) Restoring a context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM set can place the task into
    an invalid state where SVCR.SM is set (and sve_state is non-NULL)
    but TIF_SME is clear, consequently resuting in out-of-bounds memory
    reads and/or killing the task with SIGKILL.

    This can only occur in unusual (but legitimate) cases where the SVE
    signal context has either been modified by userspace or was saved in
    the context of another task (e.g. as with CRIU), as otherwise the
    presence of an SVE signal context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM implies that
    TIF_SME is already set.

    While in this state, task_fpsimd_load() will NOT configure SMCR_ELx
    (leaving some arbitrary value configured in hardware) before
    restoring SVCR and attempting to restore the streaming mode SVE
    registers from memory via sve_load_state(). As the value of
    SMCR_ELx.LEN may be larger than the task's streaming SVE vector
    length, this may read memory outside of the task's allocated
    sve_state, reading unrelated data and/or triggering a fault.

    While this can result in secrets being loaded into streaming SVE
    registers, these values are never exposed. As TIF_SME is clear,
    fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() will configure CPACR_ELx.SMEN to trap EL0
    accesses to streaming mode SVE registers, so these cannot be
    accessed directly at EL0. As fpsimd_save_user_state() verifies the
    live vector length before saving (S)SVE state to memory, no secret
    values can be saved back to memory (and hence cannot be observed via
    ptrace, signals, etc).

    When the live vector length doesn't match the expected vector length
    for the task, fpsimd_save_user_state() will send a fatal SIGKILL
    signal to the task. Hence the task may be killed after executing
    userspace for some period of time.

(2) Restoring a context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear does not clear the
    task's SVCR.SM. If SVCR.SM was set prior to restoring the context,
    then the task will be left in streaming mode unexpectedly, and some
    register state will be combined inconsistently, though the task will
    be left in legitimate state from the kernel's PoV.

    This can only occur in unusual (but legitimate) cases where ptrace
    has been used to set SVCR.SM after entry to the sigreturn syscall,
    as syscall entry clears SVCR.SM.

    In these cases, the the provided SVE register data will be loaded
    into the task's sve_state using the non-streaming SVE vector length
    and the FPSIMD registers will be merged into this using the
    streaming SVE vector length.

Fix (1) by setting TIF_SME when setting SVCR.SM. This also requires
ensuring that the task's sme_state has been allocated, but as this could
contain live ZA state, it should not be zeroed. Fix (2) by clearing
SVCR.SM when restoring a SVE signal context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear.

For consistency, I've pulled the manipulation of SVCR, TIF_SVE, TIF_SME,
and fp_type earlier, immediately after the allocation of
sve_state/sme_state, before the restore of the actual register state.
This makes it easier to ensure that these are always modified
consistently, even if a fault is taken while reading the register data
from the signal context. I do not expect any software to depend on the
exact state restored when a fault is taken while reading the context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23103 | ipvlan: Make the addrs_lock be per port</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvlan: Make the addrs_lock be per port

Make the addrs_lock be per port, not per ipvlan dev.

Initial code seems to be written in the assumption,
that any address change must occur under RTNL.
But it is not so for the case of IPv6. So

1) Introduce per-port addrs_lock.

2) It was needed to fix places where it was forgotten
to take lock (ipvlan_open/ipvlan_close)

This appears to be a very minor problem though.
Since it's highly unlikely that ipvlan_add_addr() will
be called on 2 CPU simultaneously. But nevertheless,
this could cause:

1) False-negative of ipvlan_addr_busy(): one interface
iterated through all port-&gt;ipvlans + ipvlan-&gt;addrs
under some ipvlan spinlock, and another added IP
under its own lock. Though this is only possible
for IPv6, since looks like only ipvlan_addr6_event() can be
called without rtnl_lock.

2) Race since ipvlan_ht_addr_add(port) is called under
different ipvlan-&gt;addrs_lock locks

This should not affect performance, since add/remove IP
is a rare situation and spinlock is not taken on fast
paths.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23104 | ice: fix devlink reload call trace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23104</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix devlink reload call trace

Commit 4da71a77fc3b ("ice: read internal temperature sensor") introduced
internal temperature sensor reading via HWMON. ice_hwmon_init() was added
to ice_init_feature() and ice_hwmon_exit() was added to ice_remove(). As a
result if devlink reload is used to reinit the device and then the driver
is removed, a call trace can occur.

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d

The call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system
monitoring tools (e.g., sadc) attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs
attributes that reference freed module memory.

The sequence is:
1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature()
2. Devlink reload down, flow does not call ice_remove()
3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from
   ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance
4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit() called from ice_remove() leaving the
   first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer

Fix this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to
ice_deinit_features() to ensure proper cleanup symmetry with
ice_hwmon_init().</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23105 | net/sched: qfq: Use cl_is_active to determine whether class is active in qfq_rm_from_ag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

timekeeper, this reference to tk_core was not updated. When called on an
auxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.

This gets caught by the lock debugging diagnostics because the
timekeepers sequence lock gets written to without holding its
associated spinlock:

arm64/fpsimd: signal: Allocate SSVE storage when restoring ZA

The code to restore a ZA context doesn't attempt to allocate the task's
sve_state before setting TIF_SME. Consequently, restoring a ZA context
can place a task into an invalid state where TIF_SME is set but the
task's sve_state is NULL.

In legitimate but uncommon cases where the ZA signal context was NOT
created by the kernel in the context of the same task (e.g. if the task
is saved/restored with something like CRIU), we have no guarantee that
sve_state had been allocated previously. In these cases, userspace can
enter streaming mode without trapping while sve_state is NULL, causing a
later NULL pointer dereference when the kernel attempts to store the
register state:

Fix this by having restore_za_context() ensure that the task's sve_state
is allocated, matching what we do when taking an SME trap. Any live
SVE/SSVE state (which is restored earlier from a separate signal
context) must be preserved, and hence this is not zeroed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23108 | can: usb_8dev: usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23108</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: usb_8dev: usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb:
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").

In usb_8dev_open() -&gt; usb_8dev_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are
allocated, added to the priv-&gt;rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the
complete callback usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and
resubmitted. In usb_8dev_close() -&gt; unlink_all_urbs() the URBs are freed by
calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&amp;amp;priv-&gt;rx_submitted).

However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
released in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback() to the priv-&gt;rx_submitted anchor.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23109 | fs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23109</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()

Above the while() loop in wait_sb_inodes(), we document that we must wait
for all pages under writeback for data integrity.  Consequently, if a
mapping, like fuse, traditionally does not have data integrity semantics,
there is no need to wait at all; we can simply skip these inodes.

This restores fuse back to prior behavior where syncs are no-ops.  This
fixes a user regression where if a system is running a faulty fuse server
that does not reply to issued write requests, this causes wait_sb_inodes()
to wait forever.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23110 | scsi: core: Wake up the error handler when final completions race against each other</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23110</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Wake up the error handler when final completions race against each other

The fragile ordering between marking commands completed or failed so
that the error handler only wakes when the last running command
completes or times out has race conditions. These race conditions can
cause the SCSI layer to fail to wake the error handler, leaving I/O
through the SCSI host stuck as the error state cannot advance.

First, there is an memory ordering issue within scsi_dec_host_busy().
The write which clears SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT may be reordered with reads
counting in scsi_host_busy(). While the local CPU will see its own
write, reordering can allow other CPUs in scsi_dec_host_busy() or
scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() to see a raised busy count, causing no CPU to
see a host busy equal to the host_failed count.

This race condition can be prevented with a memory barrier on the error
path to force the write to be visible before counting host busy
commands.

Second, there is a general ordering issue with scsi_eh_inc_host_failed(). By
counting busy commands before incrementing host_failed, it can race with a
final command in scsi_dec_host_busy(), such that scsi_dec_host_busy() does
not see host_failed incremented but scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() counts busy
commands before SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT is cleared by scsi_dec_host_busy(),
resulting in neither waking the error handler task.

This needs the call to scsi_host_busy() to be moved after host_failed is
incremented to close the race condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71192 | ALSA: ac97: fix a double free in snd_ac97_controller_register()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71192</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix NULL pointer crash in bnxt_ptp_enable during error cleanup

When bnxt_init_one() fails during initialization (e.g.,
bnxt_init_int_mode returns -ENODEV), the error path calls
bnxt_free_hwrm_resources() which destroys the DMA pool and sets
bp-&gt;hwrm_dma_pool to NULL. Subsequently, bnxt_ptp_clear() is called,
which invokes ptp_clock_unregister().

Since commit a60fc3294a37 ("ptp: rework ptp_clock_unregister() to
disable events"), ptp_clock_unregister() now calls
ptp_disable_all_events(), which in turn invokes the driver's .enable()
callback (bnxt_ptp_enable()) to disable PTP events before completing the
unregistration.

bnxt_ptp_enable() attempts to send HWRM commands via bnxt_ptp_cfg_pin()
and bnxt_ptp_cfg_event(), both of which call hwrm_req_init(). This
function tries to allocate from bp-&gt;hwrm_dma_pool, causing a NULL
pointer dereference:

PM: hibernate: Fix crash when freeing invalid crypto compressor

When crypto_alloc_acomp() fails, it returns an ERR_PTR value, not NULL.

The cleanup code in save_compressed_image() and load_compressed_image()
unconditionally calls crypto_free_acomp() without checking for ERR_PTR,
which causes crypto_acomp_tfm() to dereference an invalid pointer and
crash the kernel.

This can be triggered when the compression algorithm is unavailable
(e.g., CONFIG_CRYPTO_LZO not enabled).

Fix by adding IS_ERR_OR_NULL() checks before calling crypto_free_acomp()
and acomp_request_free(), similar to the existing kthread_stop() check.

Fix by using virtio_device-&gt;device consistently for

libceph: make calc_target() set t-&gt;paused, not just clear it

Currently calc_target() clears t-&gt;paused if the request shouldn't be
paused anymore, but doesn't ever set t-&gt;paused even though it's able to
determine when the request should be paused.  Setting t-&gt;paused is left
to __submit_request() which is fine for regular requests but doesn't
work for linger requests -- since __submit_request() doesn't operate
on linger requests, there is nowhere for lreq-&gt;t.paused to be set.
One consequence of this is that watches don't get reestablished on
paused -&gt; unpaused transitions in cases where requests have been paused
long enough for the (paused) unwatch request to time out and for the
subsequent (re)watch request to enter the paused state.  On top of the
watch not getting reestablished, rbd_reregister_watch() gets stuck with
rbd_dev-&gt;watch_mutex held:

  rbd_register_watch
    __rbd_register_watch
      ceph_osdc_watch
        linger_reg_commit_wait

It's waiting for lreq-&gt;reg_commit_wait to be completed, but for that to
happen the respective request needs to end up on need_resend_linger list
and be kicked when requests are unpaused.  There is no chance for that
if the request in question is never marked paused in the first place.

The fact that rbd_dev-&gt;watch_mutex remains taken out forever then
prevents the image from getting unmapped -- "rbd unmap" would inevitably
hang in D state on an attempt to grab the mutex.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23048 | udp: call skb_orphan() before skb_attempt_defer_free()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23048</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: call skb_orphan() before skb_attempt_defer_free()

Standard UDP receive path does not use skb-&gt;destructor.

But skmsg layer does use it, since it calls skb_set_owner_sk_safe()
from udp_read_skb().

This then triggers this warning in skb_attempt_defer_free():

    DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(skb-&gt;destructor);

We must call skb_orphan() to fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:00:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-70545 | A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web management interface of the PPC (Belden) ONT 2K05X router running firmwa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-70545</link><description>A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web management interface of the PPC (Belden) ONT 2K05X router running firmware v1.1.9_206L.

The installer creates this directory without proper ownership verification, creating two exploitation scenarios:

Scenario 1 (Persistent Attack):
If a low-privileged attacker pre-creates C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop before Docker Desktop installation, the attacker retains ownership of the directory even after the installer applies restrictive ACLs. At any time after installation completes, the attacker can modify the directory ACL (as the owner) and tamper with critical configuration files such as install-settings.json to specify a malicious credentialHelper, causing arbitrary code execution when any user runs Docker Desktop.

Scenario 2 (TOCTOU Attack):
During installation, there is a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition between when the installer creates C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop and when it sets secure ACLs. A low-privileged attacker actively monitoring for the installation can inject malicious files (such as install-settings.json) with attacker-controlled ACLs during this window, achieving the same code execution outcome.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:29:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15368 | SportsPress &amp;lt;= 2.7.26 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Local File Inclusion via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15368</link><description>The SportsPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.26 via shortcodes 'template_name' attribute.

The "obfuscate_literals" option in the query logs does not redact error information, exposing unredacted data in the query log when a customer writes a query that fails. It can allow a user with legitimate access to the local log files to obtain information they are not authorised to see. If this user is also in a position to run queries and trigger errors, this vulnerability can potentially help them to infer information they are not authorised to see through their intended database access.

We recommend upgrading to versions 2026.01.3 (or 5.26.21) where the issue is fixed, and reviewing query log files permissions to ensure restricted access. If your configuration had db.logs.query.obfuscate_literal enabled, and you wish the obfuscation to cover the error messages as well, you need to enable the new configuration setting db.logs.query.obfuscate_errors once you have upgraded Neo4j.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:00:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14461 | Xendit Payment &amp;lt;= 6.0.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Order Status Update to Paid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14461</link><description>The Xendit Payment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized order status manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2. This is due to the plugin exposing a publicly accessible WooCommerce API callback endpoint (`wc_xendit_callback`) that processes payment callbacks without any authentication or cryptographic verification that the requests originate from Xendit's payment gateway. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark any WooCommerce order as paid by sending a crafted POST request to the callback URL with a JSON body containing an `external_id` matching the order ID pattern and a `status` of 'PAID' or 'SETTLED', granted they can enumerate order IDs (which are sequential integers). This leads to orders being fraudulently marked as completed without any actual payment, resulting in financial loss and inventory depletion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:08:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15260 | MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce &amp;lt;= 5.6.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Loyalty Rule Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15260</link><description>The MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0.

). ParticipantGenericMessage is the DDS Security control-message container that carries not only the handshake but also on
going security-control traffic after the handshake, such as crypto-token exchange, rekeying, re-authentication, and token 
delivery for newly appearing endpoints. On receive, the CDR parser is invoked first and deserializes the `message_data` (i
.e., the `DataHolderSeq`) via the `readParticipantGenericMessage → readDataHolderSeq` path. The `DataHolderSeq` is parsed 
sequentially: a sequence count (`uint32`), and for each DataHolder the `class_id` string (e.g. `DDS:Auth:PKI-DH:1.0+Req`),
 string properties (a sequence of key/value pairs), and binary properties (a name plus an octet-vector). The parser operat
es at a stateless level and does not know higher-layer state (for example, whether the handshake has already completed), s
o it fully unfolds the structure before distinguishing legitimate from malformed traffic. Because RTPS permits duplicates,
 delays, and retransmissions, a receiver must perform at least minimal structural parsing to check identity and sequence n
umbers before discarding or processing a message; the current implementation, however, does not "peek" only at a minimal
 header and instead parses the entire `DataHolderSeq`. As a result, prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, this parsi
ng behavior can trigger an out-of-memory condition and remotely terminate the process. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 p

Although JavaScript is blocked (preventing XSS), the HTML is still preserved in the generated PDF document. As a result, an attacker can inject malicious clickable links into an ERP-generated PDF. Since PDF files generated by the ERP system are generally considered trustworthy, users are highly likely to click these links, potentially enabling phishing attacks or malware delivery. This issue occurs in the Add Quality Goal' function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:07:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67186 | TOTOLINK A950RG V4.1.2cu.5204_B20210112 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the setUrlFilterRules interface of /lib/cste_modules/fir...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67186</link><description>TOTOLINK A950RG V4.1.2cu.5204_B20210112 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the setUrlFilterRules interface of /lib/cste_modules/firewall.so.

An Insecure Direct Object Reference has been found to exist in `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver()` function within the Cloudflare Agents SDK. The issue occurs because the `Message-ID` and `References` headers are parsed to derive the target agentName and agentId without proper validation or origin checks, allowing an external attacker with control of these headers to route inbound mail to arbitrary Durable Object instances and namespaces .




Root cause

The `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver()` function lacks cryptographic verification or origin validation for the headers used in the routing logic, effectively allowing external input to dictate internal object routing.




Impact

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in email routing lets an attacker steer inbound mail to arbitrary Agent instances via spoofed Message-ID.





Mitigation:

  *  PR:  https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/email.md ] provides the necessary architectural context for coding agents to mitigate the issue by refactoring the resolver to enforce strict identity boundaries.
  *  Agents-sdk users should  upgrade to agents@0.3.7</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:53:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11598 | Exposure of Confidential Information in mObywatel application</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11598</link><description>In mObywatel iOS application an unauthorized user can use the App Switcher to view the account owner's personal information in the minimized app window, even after the login session has ended (reopening the app would require the user to log in).

Prior to 1.4.3, a critical vulnerability exists in the im-server component related to the file upload functionality found in com.xiaoleilu.loServer.action.UploadFileAction. The application exposes an endpoint (/fs) that handles multipart file uploads but fails to properly sanitize the filename provided by the user. Specifically, the writeFileUploadData method directly concatenates the configured storage directory with the filename extracted from the upload request without stripping directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../). This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to any location on the server's filesystem where the application process has write permissions. By uploading malicious files (such as scripts, executables, or overwriting configuration files like authorized_keys or cron jobs), an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and completely compromise the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69207 | Khoj has an IDOR in Notion OAuth Flow Enables Index Poisoning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69207</link><description>Khoj is a self-hostable artificial intelligence app. Prior to 2.0.0-beta.23, an IDOR in the Notion OAuth callback allows an attacker to hijack any user's Notion integration by manipulating the state parameter.

Prior to 4.1.0, the addJS method in the jspdf Node.js build utilizes a shared module-scoped variable (text) to store JavaScript content. When used in a concurrent environment (e.g., a Node.js web server), this variable is shared across all requests. If multiple requests generate PDFs simultaneously, the JavaScript content intended for one user may be overwritten by a subsequent request before the document is generated. This results in Cross-User Data Leakage, where the PDF generated for User A contains the JavaScript payload (and any embedded sensitive data) intended for User B.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with a malicious remote server to cause the local server to sign an arbitrary event upon user interaction. Upon a user account leaving a room (rejecting an invite), joining a room or knocking on a room, the victim server may ask a remote server for assistance. If the victim asks the attacker server for assistance the attacker is able to provide an arbitrary event, which the victim will sign and return to the attacker. For the /leave endpoint, this works for any event with a supported room version, where the origin and origin_server_ts is set by the victim. For the /join endpoint, an additionally victim-set content field in the format of a join membership is needed. For the /knock endpoint, an additional victim-set content field in the format of a knock membership and a room version not between 1 and 6 is needed. This was exploited as a part of a larger chain against the continuwuity.org homeserver. This vulnerability affects all Conduit-derived servers.

Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25134 | Group-Office Argument Injection in MaintenanceController::actionZipLanguage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25134</link><description>Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.

From 21.11 to before 25.11 and 26.05, every NixOS based Odoo setup publicly exposes the database manager without any authentication. This allows unauthorized actors to delete and download the entire database, including Odoos file store. Unauthorized access is evident from http requests. If kept, searching access logs and/or Odoos log for requests to /web/database can give indicators, if this has been actively exploited. The database manager is a featured intended for development and not meant to be publicly reachable. On other setups, a master password acts as 2nd line of defence. However, due to the nature of NixOS, Odoo is not able to modify its own configuration file and thus unable to persist the auto-generated password. This also applies when manually setting a master password in the web-UI. This means, the password is lost when restarting Odoo. When no password is set, the user is prompted to set one directly via the database manager. This requires no authentication or action by any authorized user or the system administrator. Thus, the database is effectively world readable by anyone able to reach Odoo. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11 and 26.05.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25142 | SandboxJS Prototype Pollution -&amp;gt; Sandbox Escape -&amp;gt; RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25142</link><description>SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library.

In 0-PRERELEASE-15 and earlier, the OAuth 2.0 implementation for GitHub and Google login providers is vulnerable to Login Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application fails to implement and verify the state parameter during the authentication flow. This allows an attacker to pre-authenticate a session and trick a victim into logging into the attacker's account. Any data the victim then enters or academic progress they make is stored on the attacker's account, leading to data loss for the victim and information disclosure to the attacker.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25222 | PolarLearn Affected by User Enumeration via Argon2 Timing Attack on Sign-In Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25222</link><description>PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program.

This is considered insecure and can be exploited by PID reuse attacks. The connection handler function uses _xpc_connection_get_pid(arg2) as argument for the hasValidSignature function. This value can not be trusted since it is vulnerable to PID reuse attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:09:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8587 | Time-Based Blind SQLi in AKCE Software&amp;#x27;s SKSPro</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8587</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in AKCE Software Technology R&amp;amp;D Industry and Trade Inc.

When a user submits input consisting only of whitespace, the program skips command execution but fails to free the allocated buffer. Repeating this action causes memory to continuously accumulate. Over time, this can exhaust system memory and terminate the xmllint process, creating a denial-of-service condition on the local system.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2356 | Remote Code Execution due to LFI in &amp;#x27;/reinstall_extension&amp;#x27; in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2356</link><description>A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the '/reinstall_extension' endpoint of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `name` parameter of the `@router.post("/reinstall_extension")` route. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject a malicious `name` parameter, leading to the server loading and executing arbitrary Python files from the upload directory for discussions. This issue arises due to the concatenation of `data.name` directly with `lollmsElfServer.lollms_paths.extensions_zoo_path` and its use as an argument for `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()`. The server's handling of the `__init__.py` file in arbitrary locations, facilitated by `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader`, enables the execution of arbitrary code, such as command execution or creating a reverse-shell connection. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the application is exposed to an external endpoint or the UI, especially when bound to `0.0.0.0` or in `headless mode`. No user interaction is required for exploitation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4147 | Insufficient Access Control in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4147</link><description>In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability allows users to delete prompts created in other organizations through ID manipulation. The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate the ownership of the prompt before deletion, only checking if the user has permissions to delete such resources without verifying if it belongs to the user's project or organization. As a result, users can remove prompts not owned by their organization or project, leading to legitimate users being unable to access the removed prompts and causing information inconsistencies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5386 | Account Hijacking via Password Reset Token Leak in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5386</link><description>In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an account hijacking vulnerability exists due to a password reset token leak. A user with a 'viewer' role can exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account by obtaining the password reset token. The vulnerability is triggered when the 'viewer' role user sends a specific request to the server, which responds with a password reset token in the 'recoveryToken' parameter. This token can then be used to reset the password of another user's account without authorization. The issue results from an excessive attack surface, allowing lower-privileged users to escalate their privileges and take over accounts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5986 | Remote Arbitrary File Write with Arbitrary Data in h2oai/h2o-3</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5986</link><description>A vulnerability in h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows remote attackers to write arbitrary data to any file on the server. This is achieved by exploiting the `/3/Parse` endpoint to inject attacker-controlled data as the header of an empty file, which is then exported using the `/3/Frames/framename/export` endpoint. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for remote code execution and complete access to the system running h2o-3, as attackers can overwrite critical files such as private SSH keys or script files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10279 | Privilege Escalation in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10279</link><description>In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). This vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite `.py` files in the virtual environment, leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue is resolved in version 3.4.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6208 | Uncontrolled Memory Consumption in run-llama/llama_index</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6208</link><description>The `SimpleDirectoryReader` component in `llama_index.core` version 0.12.23 suffers from uncontrolled memory consumption due to a resource management flaw. The vulnerability arises because the user-specified file limit (`num_files_limit`) is applied after all files in a directory are loaded into memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and degraded performance, particularly in environments with limited resources. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.41.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7105 | Denial of Service via JavaScript Memory Overflow in danny-avila/librechat</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7105</link><description>A vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat allows attackers to exploit the unrestricted Fork Function in `/api/convos/fork` to fork numerous contents rapidly. If the forked content includes a Mermaid graph with a large number of nodes, it can lead to a JavaScript heap out of memory error upon service restart, causing a denial of service. This issue affects the latest version of the product.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0599 | Unbounded External Image Fetch in Validation Leads to Resource-Exhaustion DoS in huggingface/text-generation-inference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0599</link><description>A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching during input validation in VLM mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs for Markdown image links and performs a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire response body into memory and cloning it before decoding. This behavior can lead to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation, memory inflation, and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request is later rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially crashing the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1117 | Improper Access Control in parisneo/lollms</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1117</link><description>A vulnerability in the `lollms_generation_events.py` component of parisneo/lollms version 5.9.0 allows unauthenticated access to sensitive Socket.IO events. The `add_events` function registers event handlers such as `generate_text`, `cancel_generation`, `generate_msg`, and `generate_msg_from` without implementing authentication or authorization checks. This allows unauthenticated clients to execute resource-intensive or state-altering operations, leading to potential denial of service, state corruption, and race conditions. Additionally, the use of global flags (`lollmsElfServer.busy`, `lollmsElfServer.cancel_gen`) for state management in a multi-client environment introduces further vulnerabilities, enabling one client's actions to affect the server's state and other clients' operations. The lack of proper access control and reliance on insecure global state management significantly impacts the availability and integrity of the service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54263 | WordPress Spirit Framework plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.13 - Local File Inclusion vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54263</link><description>Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in Talemy Spirit Framework allows PHP Local File Inclusion.This issue affects Spirit Framework: from n/a through 1.2.13.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:01:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1751 | Missing Authorization in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1751</link><description>A vulnerability has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting with 16.8 before 18.5.0 that could have allowed unauthorized edits to merge request approval rules under certain conditions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9974 | Insufficient Input Validation on WEBUI in Nokia ONT/Beacon product</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9974</link><description>The unified WEBUI application of the ONT/Beacon device contains an input handling flaw that allows authenticated users to trigger unintended system-level command execution.
