The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA, LoRa settings`, `loading tokenizers,` and `hardware settings`, `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless, `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment`, which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 17:27:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33819 | Globitel KSA SpeechLog v8.1 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Save Query function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33819</link><description>Globitel KSA SpeechLog v8.1 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Save Query function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 17:13:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4725 | Campcodes Legal Case Management System client_user cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4725</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Campcodes Legal Case Management System 1.0 and classified as problematic.
