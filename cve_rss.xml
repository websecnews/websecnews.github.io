Prior to versions 1.16.17, 1.17.10, and 1.18.4, CiliumNetworkPolicys which use egress.toGroups.aws.securityGroupsIds to reference AWS security group IDs that do not exist or are not attached to any network interface may unintentionally allow broader outbound access than intended by the policy authors. In such cases, the toCIDRset section of the derived policy is not generated, which means outbound traffic may be permitted to more destinations than originally intended. This issue has been patched in versions 1.16.17, 1.17.10, and 1.18.4. There are no workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 01:52:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13683 | Exposure of credentials in unintended requests in Devolutions Server, Remote Desktop Manager on Windows.This issue affects Devolutions Serve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13683</link><description>Exposure of credentials in unintended requests in Devolutions Server, Remote Desktop Manager on Windows.This issue affects Devolutions Server: through 2025.3.8.0; Remote Desktop Manager: through 2025.3.23.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:22:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12183 | org.lz4:lz4-java - Out-of-Bounds Memory Access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12183</link><description>Out-of-bounds memory operations in org.lz4:lz4-java 1.8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause denial of service and read adjacent memory via untrusted compressed input.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51735 | CSV formula injection vulnerability in HCL Technologies Ltd.

The vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's tarfile.extractall() method without the security-critical filter='data' parameter. Although Keras attempts to filter unsafe paths using filter_safe_paths(), this filtering occurs before extraction, and a PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits, resulting in a security bypass that allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the cache directory, enabling potential system compromise or malicious code execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations that process tar archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this extraction method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:27:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12143 | Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12143</link><description>Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ABB Terra AC wallbox.This issue affects Terra AC wallbox: through 1.8.33.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:28:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13771 | Uniong｜WebITR - Arbitrary File Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13771</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to exploit Relative Path Traversal to download arbitrary system files.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:59:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13769 | Uniong｜WebITR - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13769</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has a SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands to read database contents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13770 | Uniong｜WebITR - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13770</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has a SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands to read database contents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13768 | Uniong｜WebITR - Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13768</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has an Authentication Bypass vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to log into the system as any user by modifying a specific parameter.

The exploit can be triggered when any user accesses the public API endpoint of the malicious SVG images, or if the malicious images are embedded in an `iframe` element, during a widget creation, deployed to any page of the platform (e.g., dashboards), and accessed during normal operations. The vulnerability resides in the `ImageController`, which fails to restrict the execution of JavaScript code when an image is loaded by the user's browser. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:15:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12421 | Account Takeover via Code Exchange Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12421</link><description>Mattermost versions 11.0.x &lt;= 11.0.2, 10.12.x &lt;= 10.12.1, 10.11.x &lt;= 10.11.4, 10.5.x &lt;= 10.5.12 fail to to verify that the token used during the code exchange originates from the same authentication flow, which allows an authenticated user to perform account takeover via a specially crafted email address used when switching authentication methods and sending a request to the /users/login/sso/code-exchange endpoint.

For example, when {name} is used in an email template, it will be replaced with the buyer's name for the final email. If the name of the attendee contained HTML or Markdown formatting, this was rendered as HTML in the resulting email. This way, a user could inject links or other formatted text through a maliciously formatted name. Since pretix applies a strict allow list approach to allowed HTML tags, this could not be abused for XSS or similarly dangerous attack chains. However, it can be used to manipulate emails in a way that makes user-provided content appear in a trustworthy and credible way, which can be abused for phishing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:10:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10476 | WP Fastest Cache &amp;lt;= 1.4.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) DB Cleanup Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10476</link><description>The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_db_fix_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0.
