An attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP whitelist, could potentially acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.

To mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37206 | WordPress Demo Awesome plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.1 -
