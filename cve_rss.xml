In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default. Version 1.4.19 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 22:30:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54126 | WebAssembly Micro Runtime&amp;#x27;s `--addr-pool` option allows all IPv4 addresses when subnet mask is not specified</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54126</link><description>The WebAssembly Micro Runtime's (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface. In versions 2.4.0 and below, iwasm uses --addr-pool with an IPv4 address that lacks a subnet mask, allowing the system to accept all IP addresses. This can unintentionally expose the service to all incoming connections and bypass intended access restrictions. Services relying on --addr-pool for restricting access by IP may unintentionally become open to all external connections. This may lead to unauthorized access in production deployments, especially when users assume that specifying an IP without a subnet mask implies a default secure configuration. This is fixed in version 2.4.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 22:00:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7848 | Missing input check in lvpict.cpp used in NI LabVIEW</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7848</link><description>A memory corruption vulnerability due to improper input validation in lvpict.cpp exists in NI LabVIEW that may result in arbitrary code execution.

In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical security vulnerability exists in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation, user passwords are transmitted via shared memory, exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly severe during password modification operations, where both old and new passwords are passed as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation. This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session, including unprivileged processes, to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments, thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk. This is fixed in version 1.16.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:43:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6504 | Possibilities of IP Spoofing via X-Forwarded-For (XFF) Header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6504</link><description>In HDP Server versions below 4.6.2.2978 on Linux, unauthorized access could occur via IP spoofing using the X-Forwarded-For header.

There are various account address types in Frontier, e.g. precompiled contracts, smart contracts, and externally owned accounts. Some EVM mechanisms should be unreachable by certain types of accounts for safety. For precompiles to be callable by smart contracts they must be explicitly configured as CallableByContract. If this configuration is absent, then the precompile should be unreachable via smart contract accounts. In commits prior to 0822030, the underlying implementation of CallableByContract which returned the AddressType was incorrect. It considered the contract address running under CREATE or CREATE2 to be AddressType::EOA rather than correctly as AddressType::Contract. The issue only affects users who use custom precompile implementations that utilize AddressType::EOA and AddressType::Contract. It's not directly exploitable in any of the predefined precompiles in Frontier. This is fixed in version 0822030.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:55:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54427 | Polkadot Frontier contains missing `check_inherent` for `note_min_gas_price_target` inflates gas price</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54427</link><description>Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. The extrinsic note_min_gas_price_target is an inherent extrinsic, meaning only the block producer can call it. To ensure correctness, the ProvideInherent trait should be implemented for each inherent, which includes the check_inherent call. This allows other nodes to verify if the input (in this case, the target value) is correct. However, prior to commit a754b3d, the check_inherent function has not been implemented for note_min_gas_price_target. This lets the block producer set the target value without verification. The target is then used to set the MinGasPrice, which has an upper and lower bound defined in the on_initialize hook. The block producer can set the target to the upper bound. Which also increases the upper and lower bounds for the next block. Over time, this could result in continuously raising the gas price, making contract execution too expensive and ineffective for users. An attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the gas price, potentially leading to significantly inflated transaction fees. Such manipulation could render contract execution prohibitively expensive for users, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service condition for the network. This is fixed in version a754b3d.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:40:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54428 | RevelaCode exposes Sensitive MongoDB Atlas URI in .env (potential credential leak)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54428</link><description>RevelaCode is an AI-powered faith-tech project that decodes biblical verses, prophecies and global events into accessible language.

A command injection vulnerability present in versions prior to 4.6.2 affects applications that use the ImageMagick handler for image processing (`imagick` as the image library) and either allow file uploads with user-controlled filenames and process uploaded images using the `resize()` method or use the `text()` method with user-controlled text content or options. An attacker can upload a file with a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters that get executed when the image is processed or provide malicious text content or options that get executed when adding text to images Users should upgrade to v4.6.2 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, switch to the GD image handler (`gd`, the default handler), which is not affected by either vulnerability. For file upload scenarios, instead of using user-provided filenames, generate random names to eliminate the attack vector with `getRandomName()` when using the `move()` method, or use the `store()` method, which automatically generates safe filenames. For text operations, if one must use ImageMagick with user-controlled text, sanitize the input to only allow safe characters and validate/restrict text options.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 15:00:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53696 | iSTAR Ultra performs a firmware verification on boot, however the verification does not inspect certain portions of the firmware.

net/sched: Return NULL when htb_lookup_leaf encounters an empty rbtree

htb_lookup_leaf has a BUG_ON that can trigger with the following:

tc qdisc del dev lo root
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 64bit
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: netem
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: blackhole
ping -I lo -c1 -W0.001 127.0.0.1

The root cause is the following:

1. htb_dequeue calls htb_dequeue_tree which calls the dequeue handler on
   the selected leaf qdisc
2. netem_dequeue calls enqueue on the child qdisc
3. blackhole_enqueue drops the packet and returns a value that is not
   just NET_XMIT_SUCCESS
4. Because of this, netem_dequeue calls qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, and
   since qlen is now 0, it calls htb_qlen_notify -&gt; htb_deactivate -&gt;
   htb_deactiviate_prios -&gt; htb_remove_class_from_row -&gt; htb_safe_rb_erase
5. As this is the only class in the selected hprio rbtree,
   __rb_change_child in __rb_erase_augmented sets the rb_root pointer to
   NULL
6. Because blackhole_dequeue returns NULL, netem_dequeue returns NULL,
   which causes htb_dequeue_tree to call htb_lookup_leaf with the same
   hprio rbtree, and fail the BUG_ON

The function graph for this scenario is shown here:
 0)               |  htb_enqueue() {
 0) + 13.635 us   |    netem_enqueue();

KVM: x86/xen: Fix cleanup logic in emulation of Xen schedop poll hypercalls

kvm_xen_schedop_poll does a kmalloc_array() when a VM polls the host
for more than one event channel potr (nr_ports &gt; 1).

After the kmalloc_array(), the error paths need to go through the
"out" label, but the call to kvm_read_guest_virt() does not.

net: vlan: fix VLAN 0 refcount imbalance of toggling filtering during runtime

Assuming the "rx-vlan-filter" feature is enabled on a net device, the
8021q module will automatically add or remove VLAN 0 when the net device
is put administratively up or down, respectively. There are a couple of
problems with the above scheme.

The first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the "rx-vlan-filter"
feature is disabled while the device is running:

 # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0
 # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off
 # ip link del dev bond1

When the device is put administratively down the "rx-vlan-filter"
feature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the
memory will be leaked [1].

Another problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically
delete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not
adding it when the device was put administratively up since during that
time the "rx-vlan-filter" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or
bug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount
imbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:

$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0
$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q
$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off
$ ifconfig bond0 up
$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on
$ ifconfig bond0 down
$ ip link del vlan0

Root cause is as below:
step1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.
register_vlan_dev
    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1
step2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev
step3: change filter from 0 to 1
vlan_device_event
    vlan_filter_push_vids
        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0
step4: real_dev down
vlan_device_event
    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0
        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0
step5: delete vlan0
unregister_vlan_dev
    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null

Fix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was
automatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it
should be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the
"rx-vlan-filter" feature.

netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix crash due to removal of uninitialised entry

A crash in conntrack was reported while trying to unlink the conntrack
entry from the hash bucket list:
    [exception RIP: __nf_ct_delete_from_lists+172]
    [..]
 #7 [ff539b5a2b043aa0] nf_ct_delete at ffffffffc124d421 [nf_conntrack]
 #8 [ff539b5a2b043ad0] nf_ct_gc_expired at ffffffffc124d999 [nf_conntrack]
 #9 [ff539b5a2b043ae0] __nf_conntrack_find_get at ffffffffc124efbc [nf_conntrack]
    [..]

The nf_conn struct is marked as allocated from slab but appears to be in
a partially initialised state:

 ct hlist pointer is garbage; looks like the ct hash value
 (hence crash).
 ct-&gt;status is equal to IPS_CONFIRMED|IPS_DYING, which is expected
 ct-&gt;timeout is 30000 (=30s), which is unexpected.

Everything else looks like normal udp conntrack entry.  If we ignore
ct-&gt;status and pretend its 0, the entry matches those that are newly
allocated but not yet inserted into the hash:
  - ct hlist pointers are overloaded and store/cache the raw tuple hash
  - ct-&gt;timeout matches the relative time expected for a new udp flow
    rather than the absolute 'jiffies' value.

If it were not for the presence of IPS_CONFIRMED,
__nf_conntrack_find_get() would have skipped the entry.

Theory is that we did hit following race:

cpu x 			cpu y			cpu z
 found entry E		found entry E
 E is expired		
 nf_ct_delete()
 return E to rcu slab
					init_conntrack
					E is re-inited,
					ct-&gt;status set to 0
					reply tuplehash hnnode.pprev
					stores hash value.

cpu y found E right before it was deleted on cpu x.
E is now re-inited on cpu z.  cpu y was preempted before
checking for expiry and/or confirm bit.

					-&gt;refcnt set to 1
					E now owned by skb
					-&gt;timeout set to 30000

If cpu y were to resume now, it would observe E as
expired but would skip E due to missing CONFIRMED bit.

					nf_conntrack_confirm gets called
					sets: ct-&gt;status |= CONFIRMED
					This is wrong: E is not yet added
					to hashtable.

cpu y resumes, it observes E as expired but CONFIRMED:
			
			nf_ct_expired()
			 -&gt; yes (ct-&gt;timeout is 30s)
			confirmed bit set.

cpu y will try to delete E from the hashtable:
			nf_ct_delete() -&gt; set DYING bit
			__nf_ct_delete_from_lists

Even this scenario doesn't guarantee a crash:
cpu z still holds the table bucket lock(s) so y blocks:

			wait for spinlock held by z

					CONFIRMED is set but there is no
					guarantee ct will be added to hash:
					"chaintoolong" or "clash resolution"
					logic both skip the insert step.
					reply hnnode.pprev still stores the
					hash value.

					unlocks spinlock
					return NF_DROP
			

In case CPU z does insert the entry into the hashtable, cpu y will unlink
E again right away but no crash occurs.

Without 'cpu y' race, 'garbage' hlist is of no consequence:
ct refcnt remains at 1, eventually skb will be free'd and E gets
destroyed via: nf_conntrack_put -&gt; nf_conntrack_destroy -&gt; nf_ct_destroy.

To resolve this, move the IPS_CONFIRMED assignment after the table
insertion but before the unlock.

Pablo points out that the confirm-bit-store could be reordered to happen
before hlist add resp. the timeout fixup, so switch to set_bit and
before_atomic memory barrier to prevent this.

It doesn't matter if other CPUs can observe a newly inserted entry right
before the CONFIRMED bit was set:

Such event cannot be distinguished from above "E is the old incarnation"
case: the entry will be skipped.

Also change nf_ct_should_gc() to first check the confirmed bit.

The gc sequence is:
 1. Check if entry has expired, if not skip to next entry
 2. Obtain a reference to the expired entry.
 3. Call nf_ct_should_gc() to double-check step 1.

nf_ct_should_gc() is thus called only for entries that already failed an
expiry check. After this patch, once the confirmed bit check pas

l2cap_sock_resume_cb() has a similar problem that was fixed by commit
1bff51ea59a9 ("Bluetooth: fix use-after-free error in lock_sock_nested()").

Since both l2cap_sock_kill() and l2cap_sock_resume_cb() are executed
under l2cap_sock_resume_cb(), we can avoid the issue simply by checking
if chan-&gt;data is NULL.

Let's not access to the killed socket in l2cap_sock_resume_cb().

smc: Fix various oops due to inet_sock type confusion.

syzbot reported weird splats [0][1] in cipso_v4_sock_setattr() while
freeing inet_sk(sk)-&gt;inet_opt.

The address was freed multiple times even though it was read-only memory.

cipso_v4_sock_setattr() did nothing wrong, and the root cause was type
confusion.

The cited commit made it possible to create smc_sock as an INET socket.

The issue is that struct smc_sock does not have struct inet_sock as the
first member but hijacks AF_INET and AF_INET6 sk_family, which confuses
various places.

In this case, inet_sock.inet_opt was actually smc_sock.clcsk_data_ready(),
which is an address of a function in the text segment.

  $ pahole -C inet_sock vmlinux
  struct inet_sock {
  ...
          struct ip_options_rcu *    inet_opt;             /*   784     8 */

  $ pahole -C smc_sock vmlinux
  struct smc_sock {
  ...
          void                       (*clcsk_data_ready)(struct sock *); /*   784     8 */

The same issue for another field was reported before. [2][3]

At that time, an ugly hack was suggested [4], but it makes both INET
and SMC code error-prone and hard to change.

Also, yet another variant was fixed by a hacky commit 98d4435efcbf3
("net/smc: prevent NULL pointer dereference in txopt_get").

Instead of papering over the root cause by such hacks, we should not
allow non-INET socket to reuse the INET infra.

Let's add inet_sock as the first member of smc_sock.

rpl: Fix use-after-free in rpl_do_srh_inline().

Running lwt_dst_cache_ref_loop.sh in selftest with KASAN triggers
the splat below [0].

rpl_do_srh_inline() fetches ipv6_hdr(skb) and accesses it after
skb_cow_head(), which is illegal as the header could be freed then.

Let's fix it by making oldhdr to a local struct instead of a pointer.

comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice

Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access
instruction data elements beyond the first `insn-&gt;n` elements in some
cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions
allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,
but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes
that write to the subdevice, the first `insn-&gt;n` data elements are
copied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left
uninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction
handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first
`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction
handlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for
handling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`
elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the
subdevice.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:36:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38480 | comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38480</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()

For Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on "digital"
subdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and
`COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have
`insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an
`insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`
instructions.  In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or
`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the
`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.

For `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the
supplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at
least exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in
"comedi_fops.c" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are
allocated.  However, if `insn-&gt;n` is 0 (which is allowable for
`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain
uninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a
different instruction in the array of instructions handled by
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being
written to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output
channel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the
internal saved state of the channel.

Fix it by returning 0 early if `insn-&gt;n` is 0, before reaching the code
that accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on
success, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually
read or written up to `insn-&gt;n`, which is 0 in this case.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:36:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38481 | comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38481</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

The handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to
hold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the
`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.
The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too
large.

Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`
value is unreasonable.

Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set
this to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximum
allowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct
comedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at
least 1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:36:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38482 | comedi: das6402: Fix bit shift out of bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38482</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Dan has also reported following issues with the original patch
https://lore.kernel.org/all/33fe8fe7-719a-405a-9ed2-d9f816ce1d57@sabinyo.mountain/

Bug #1:
The zeroeth element of ctrl-&gt;pconfig[] is supposed to be unused.  We
start counting at 1.  However this code sets ctrl-&gt;pconfig[0].ch_mask = 128.

Bug #2:
There are SLIM_MAX_TX_PORTS (16) elements in tx_ch[] array but only
QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS + 1 (15) in the ctrl-&gt;pconfig[] array so it corrupts
memory like Yongqin Liu pointed out.

Bug 3:
Like Jie Gan pointed out, it erases all the tx information with the rx
information.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:37:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38487 | soc: aspeed: lpc-snoop: Don&amp;#x27;t disable channels that aren&amp;#x27;t enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38487</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &amp;amp;req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
CVE-2024-50047 fix.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:37:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38489 | s390/bpf: Fix bpf_arch_text_poke() with new_addr == NULL again</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38489</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

or building a skb if the size is too short. At other times, the pages
need to be reused. So remove the redundant page put. In the original
code, double free pages cause kernel panic:

netfs: Fix race between cache write completion and ALL_QUEUED being set

When netfslib is issuing subrequests, the subrequests start processing
immediately and may complete before we reach the end of the issuing
function.  At the end of the issuing function we set NETFS_RREQ_ALL_QUEUED
to indicate to the collector that we aren't going to issue any more subreqs
and that it can do the final notifications and cleanup.

Now, this isn't a problem if the request is synchronous
(NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION is unset) as the result collection will be
done in-thread and we're guaranteed an opportunity to run the collector.

However, if the request is asynchronous, collection is primarily triggered
by the termination of subrequests queuing it on a workqueue.  Now, a race
can occur here if the app thread sets ALL_QUEUED after the last subrequest
terminates.

This can happen most easily with the copy2cache code (as used by Ceph)
where, in the collection routine of a read request, an asynchronous write
request is spawned to copy data to the cache.  Folios are added to the
write request as they're unlocked, but there may be a delay before
ALL_QUEUED is set as the write subrequests may complete before we get
there.

If all the write subreqs have finished by the ALL_QUEUED point, no further
events happen and the collection never happens, leaving the request
hanging.

Fix this by queuing the collector after setting ALL_QUEUED.  This is a bit
heavy-handed and it may be sufficient to do it only if there are no extant
subreqs.

Also add a tracepoint to cross-reference both requests in a copy-to-request
operation and add a trace to the netfs_rreq tracepoint to indicate the
setting of ALL_QUEUED.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38493 | tracing/osnoise: Fix crash in timerlat_dump_stack()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38493</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

__timerlat_dump_stack() constructs the ftrace stack entry like this:

struct stack_entry *entry;
...
memcpy(&amp;amp;entry-&gt;caller, fstack-&gt;calls, size);
entry-&gt;size = fstack-&gt;nr_entries;

Since commit e7186af7fb26 ("tracing: Add back FORTIFY_SOURCE logic to
kernel_stack event structure"), struct stack_entry marks its caller
field with __counted_by(size). At the time of the memcpy, entry-&gt;size
contains garbage from the ringbuffer, which under some circumstances is
zero, triggering a kernel panic by buffer overflow.

Populate the size field before the memcpy so that the out-of-bounds
check knows the correct size. This is analogous to
__ftrace_trace_stack().</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38494 | HID: core: do not bypass hid_hw_raw_request</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38494</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This allowed an authenticated attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

RTE properties (text fields), which could be used in the "Edit" section of the CMS,
allowed the input of arbitrary text. It was possible to input malicious JavaScript 
code in these properties that would be executed if a user visits the previewed 
page. Attackers needed at least the role "WebEditor" in order to exploit this issue.

Affected products: Version 11.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (&lt;11.21.4) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (&lt;11.37.5), Version 12.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (&lt;12.22.1) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (&lt;11.37.3)</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 08:58:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27800 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Episerver Content Management System (CMS) Admin Dashboard</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27800</link><description>The Episerver Content Management System (CMS) by Optimizely was affected by multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

The Admin dashboard offered the functionality to add gadgets to the dashboard.
This included the "Notes" gadget. An authenticated attacker with the corresponding
access rights (such as "WebAdmin") that was impersonating the victim could insert
malicious JavaScript code in these notes that would be executed if the victim
visited the dashboard.

ContentReference properties, which could be used in the "Edit" section of the CMS, offered an upload functionality for documents. These documents could later be used as displayed content on the page. It was possible to upload SVG files that include malicious JavaScript code that would be executed if a user visited the direct URL of the preview image. Attackers needed at least the role "WebEditor" in order to exploit this issue.
