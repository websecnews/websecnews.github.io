Versiosn prior to2.2.0 have a protocol compliance vulnerability. The library allowed post-quantum handshake patterns that violated the PSK validity rule (Noise Protocol Framework Section 9.3). This could allow PSK-derived keys to be used for encryption without proper randomization by self-chosen ephemeral randomness, weakening security guarantees and potentially allowing catastrophic key reuse. Affected default patterns include `noise_pqkk_psk0`, `noise_pqkn_psk0`, `noise_pqnk_psk0`, `noise_pqnn_psk0``, and some hybrid variants. Users of these patterns may have been using handshakes that do not meet the intended security properties. The issue is fully patched and released in Clatter v2.2.0. The fixed version includes runtime checks to detect offending handshake patterns. As a workaround, avoid using offending `*_psk0` variants of post-quantum patterns. Review custom handshake patterns carefully.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:44:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55292 | In Meshtastic, an attacker can spoof licensed amateur flag for a node</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55292</link><description>Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. In the current Meshtastic architecture, a Node is identified by their NodeID, generated from the MAC address, rather than their public key. This aspect downgrades the security, specifically by abusing the HAM mode which doesn't use encryption. An attacker can, as such, forge a NodeInfo on behalf of a victim node advertising that the HAM mode is enabled. This, in turn, will allow the other nodes on the mesh to accept the new information and overwriting the NodeDB. The other nodes will then only be able to send direct messages to the victim by using the shared channel key instead of the PKC. Additionally, because HAM mode by design doesn't provide any confidentiality or authentication of information, the attacker could potentially also be able to change the Node details, like the full name, short code, etc. To keep the attack persistent, it is enough to regularly resend the forged NodeInfo, in particular right after the victim sends their own. A patch is available in version 2.7.6.834c3c5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:44:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23830 | SandboxJS has Sandbox Escape via Unprotected AsyncFunction Constructor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23830</link><description>SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Versions prior to 0.8.26 have a sandbox escape vulnerability due to `AsyncFunction` not being isolated in `SandboxFunction`. The library attempts to sandbox code execution by replacing the global `Function` constructor with a safe, sandboxed version (`SandboxFunction`). This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function` to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups. However, before version 0.8.26, the library did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`. These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property of an instance (e.g., `(async () =&gt; {}).constructor`). In `executor.ts`, property access is handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction` was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction` constructor. Constructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor, an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context, bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution). Version 0.8.26 patches this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:44:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54373 | OpenEMR may expose Contents of Clinical Notes and Care Planto users who do not have Sensitivities=high privilege</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54373</link><description>OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application.

Versions prior to 7.0.4 have a broken access control in the Profile Edit endpoint. An authenticated normal user can modify the request parameters (pubpid / pid) to reference another user’s record; the server accepts the modified IDs and applies the changes to that other user’s profile. This allows one user to alter another user’s profile data (name, contact info, etc.), and could enable account takeover.

In versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, the `mulDiv(x, y, z)` function incorrectly handled cases where both the intermediate product $x * y$ and the divisor $z$ were negative. The logic assumed that if the intermediate product was negative, the final result must also be negative, neglecting the sign of $z$. This resulted in rounding being applied in the wrong direction for cases where both $x * y$ and $z$ were negative. The functions most at risk are `fixed_div_floor` and `fixed_div_ceil`, as they often use non-constant numbers as the divisor $z$ in `mulDiv`.  This error is present in all signed `FixedPoint` and `SorobanFixedPoint` implementations, including `i64`, `i128`, and `I256`. Versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 contain a patch. No known workarounds for this issue are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:29:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24778 | Ghost vulnerable to XSS via malicious Portal preview links</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24778</link><description>Ghost is an open source content management system. In Ghost versions 5.43.0 through 5.12.04 and 6.0.0 through 6.14.0, an attacker was able to craft a malicious link that, when accessed by an authenticated staff user or member, would execute JavaScript with the victim's permissions, potentially leading to account takeover. Ghost Portal versions 2.29.1 through 2.51.4 and 2.52.0 through 2.57.0 were vulnerable to this issue. Ghost automatically loads the latest patch of the members Portal component via CDN.

Prior to version 0.14.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector` class within the vLLM project's multimodal feature set. The load_from_url and load_from_url_async methods obtain and process media from URLs provided by users, using different Python parsing libraries when restricting the target host. These two parsing libraries have different interpretations of backslashes, which allows the host name restriction to be bypassed. This allows an attacker to coerce the vLLM server into making arbitrary requests to internal network resources. This vulnerability is particularly critical in containerized environments like `llm-d`, where a compromised vLLM pod could be used to scan the internal network, interact with other pods, and potentially cause denial of service or access sensitive data. For example, an attacker could make the vLLM pod send malicious requests to an internal `llm-d` management endpoint, leading to system instability by falsely reporting metrics like the KV cache state. Version 0.14.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24770 | RAGFlow Affected by Zip Slip Remote Code Execution (RCE) in MinerUParser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24770</link><description>RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In version 0.23.1 and possibly earlier versions, the MinerU parser contains a "Zip Slip" vulnerability, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the server (leading to Remote Code Execution) via a malicious ZIP archive. The MinerUParser class retrieves and extracts ZIP files from an external source (mineru_server_url). The extraction logic in `_extract_zip_no_root` fails to sanitize filenames within the ZIP archive.

A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, and 8.5.52 involving unsafe deserialization of code coverage data in PHPT test execution. The vulnerability exists in the `cleanupForCoverage()` method, which deserializes code coverage files without validation, potentially allowing remote code execution if malicious `.coverage` files are present prior to the execution of the PHPT test. The vulnerability occurs when a `.coverage` file, which should not exist before test execution, is deserialized without the `allowed_classes` parameter restriction. An attacker with local file write access can place a malicious serialized object with a `__wakeup()` method into the file system, leading to arbitrary code execution during test runs with code coverage instrumentation enabled. This vulnerability requires local file write access to the location where PHPUnit stores or expects code coverage files for PHPT tests. This can occur through CI/CD pipeline attacks, the local development environment, and/or compromised dependencies. Rather than just silently sanitizing the input via `['allowed_classes' =&gt; false]`, the maintainer has chosen to make the anomalous state explicit by treating pre-existing `.coverage` files for PHPT tests as an error condition. Starting in versions  in versions 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, when a `.coverage` file is detected for a PHPT test prior to execution, PHPUnit will emit a clear error message identifying the anomalous state. Organizations can reduce the effective risk of this vulnerability through proper CI/CD configuration, including ephemeral runners, code review enforcement, branch protection, artifact isolation, and access control.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:51:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24748 | Kargo&amp;#x27;s `GetConfig()` and `RefreshResource()` API endpoints allow unauthenticated access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24748</link><description>Kargo manages and automates the promotion of software artifacts. Prior to versions 1.8.7, 1.7.7, and 1.6.3, a bug was found with authentication checks on the `GetConfig()` API endpoint. This allowed unauthenticated users to access this endpoint by specifying an `Authorization` header with any non-empty `Bearer` token value, regardless of validity.  This vulnerability did allow for exfiltration of configuration data such as endpoints for connected Argo CD clusters. This data could allow an attacker to enumerate cluster URLs and namespaces for use in subsequent attacks. Additionally, the same bug affected the `RefreshResource` endpoint. This endpoint does not lead to any information disclosure, but could be used by an unauthenticated attacker to perform a denial-of-service style attack against the Kargo API. `RefreshResource` sets an annotation on specific Kubernetes resources to trigger reconciliations. If run on a constant loop, this could also slow down legitimate requests to the Kubernetes API server. This problem has been patched in Kargo versiosn 1.8.7, 1.7.7, and 1.6.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:38:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24741 | ConvertX Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion via Path Traversal in `POST /delete`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24741</link><description>ConvertXis a self-hosted online file converter. In versions prior to 0.17.0, the `POST /delete` endpoint uses a user-controlled `filename` value to construct a filesystem path and deletes it via `unlink` without sufficient validation. By supplying path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can delete arbitrary files outside the intended uploads directory, limited only by the permissions of the server process. Version 0.17.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:38:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24747 | PyTorch Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Untrusted Checkpoint Files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24747</link><description>PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation. Prior to version 2.10.0, a vulnerability in PyTorch's `weights_only` unpickler allows an attacker to craft a malicious checkpoint file (`.pth`) that, when loaded with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`, can corrupt memory and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. Version 2.10.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:38:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24738 | gmrtd ReadFile Vulnerable to Denial of Service via Excessive TLV Length Values</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24738</link><description>gmrtd is a Go library for reading Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). Prior to version 0.17.2, ReadFile accepts TLVs with lengths that can range up to 4GB, which can cause unconstrained resource consumption in both memory and cpu cycles. ReadFile can consume an extended TLV with lengths well outside what would be available in ICs. It can accept something all the way up to 4GB which would take too many iterations in 256 byte chunks, and would also try to allocate memory that might not be available in constrained environments like phones. Or if an API sends data  to ReadFile, the same problem applies. The very small chunked read also locks the goroutine in  accepting data for a very large number of iterations.  projects using the gmrtd library to read files from NFCs can experience extreme slowdowns or memory consumption. A malicious NFC can just behave like the mock transceiver described above and by just sending dummy bytes as each chunk to be read, can make the receiving thread unresponsive and fill up memory on the host system. Version 0.17.2 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:20:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24740 | Dozzle Agent Label-Based Access Control Bypass Allows Unauthorized Container Shell Access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24740</link><description>Dozzle is a realtime log viewer for docker containers.

Versions of the application up to and including 7.21.0 allow users to define "Webhooks" as actions within the Rules engine. The url parameter in the webhook configuration does not appear to validate or restrict destination IP addresses. It accepts local addresses such as 127.0.0.1 or localhost. When a rule is triggered (Either manual trigger by manually calling the trigger endpoint or by a content update or any other triggers), the backend server executes an HTTP request to the user-supplied URL. Crucially, the server logs the full HTTP response in the rule execution log (lastDump field), which is accessible via the API. Which turns a "Blind" SSRF into a "Full Read" SSRF. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:58:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21589 | Session Smart Router, Session Smart Conductor, WAN Assurance Router: API Authentication Bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21589</link><description>An Authentication Bypass Using an

Starting in version 29.0.0 and prior to version 36.0.5, 40.0.3, and 41.0.1, on x86-64 platforms with AVX, Wasmtime's compilation of the `f64.copysign` WebAssembly instruction with Cranelift may load 8 more bytes than is necessary. When signals-based-traps are disabled this can result in a uncaught segfault due to loading from unmapped guard pages. With guard pages disabled it's possible for out-of-sandbox data to be loaded, but unless there is another bug in Cranelift this data is not visible to WebAssembly guests. Wasmtime 36.0.5, 40.0.3, and 41.0.1 have been released to fix this issue. Users are recommended to upgrade to the patched versions of Wasmtime. Other affected versions are not patched and users should updated to supported major version instead. This bug can be worked around by enabling signals-based-traps. While disabling guard pages can be a quick fix in some situations, it's not recommended to disabled guard pages as it is a key defense-in-depth measure of Wasmtime.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:20:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24398 | Hono&amp;#x27;s IPv4 address validation bypass in IP Restriction Middleware allows IP spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24398</link><description>Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.

OctoPrint versions up to and including 1.11.5 are affected by a (theoretical) timing attack vulnerability that allows API key extraction over the network. Due to using character based comparison that short-circuits on the first mismatched character during API key validation, rather than a cryptographical method with static runtime regardless of the point of mismatch, an attacker with network based access to an affected OctoPrint could extract API keys valid on the instance by measuring the response times of the denied access responses and guess an API key character by character. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.11.6. The likelihood of this attack actually working is highly dependent on the network's latency, noise and similar parameters. An actual proof of concept was not achieved so far. Still, as always administrators are advised to not expose their OctoPrint instance on hostile networks, especially not on the public Internet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:20:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24881 | In GnuPG before 2.5.17, a crafted CMS (S/MIME) EnvelopedData message carrying an oversized wrapped session key can cause a stack-based buffe...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24881</link><description>In GnuPG before 2.5.17, a crafted CMS (S/MIME) EnvelopedData message carrying an oversized wrapped session key can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in gpg-agent during PKDECRYPT--kem=CMS handling.

which can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, invalid pointer or NULL
pointer dereference during MAC verification.

Impact summary: The stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer dereference may
cause a crash leading to Denial of Service for an application that parses
untrusted PKCS#12 files. The buffer overflow may also potentially enable
code execution depending on platform mitigations.

When verifying a PKCS#12 file that uses PBMAC1 for the MAC, the PBKDF2
salt and keylength parameters from the file are used without validation.
If the value of keylength exceeds the size of the fixed stack buffer used
for the derived key (64 bytes), the key derivation will overflow the buffer.
The overflow length is attacker-controlled. Also, if the salt parameter is
not an OCTET STRING type this can lead to invalid or NULL pointer
dereference.

Exploiting this issue requires a user or application to process
a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted
PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private
keys which are trusted by definition. For this reason the issue was assessed
as Moderate severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are not affected by this issue, as
PKCS#12 processing is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue as they do

crafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.

Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial
of Service, or potentially remote code execution.

When parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as
AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is
copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits
the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an
oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any
authentication or tag verification occurs.

Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using
AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable.
Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material
is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution
depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write
primitive represents a severe risk.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.

a QUIC protocol client or server receives an unknown cipher suite from
the peer, a NULL dereference occurs.

Impact summary: A NULL pointer dereference leads to abnormal termination of
the running process causing Denial of Service.

Some applications call SSL_CIPHER_find() from the client_hello_cb callback
on the cipher ID received from the peer. If this is done with an SSL object
implementing the QUIC protocol, NULL pointer dereference will happen if
the examined cipher ID is unknown or unsupported.

As it is not very common to call this function in applications using the QUIC 
protocol and the worst outcome is Denial of Service, the issue was assessed
as Low severity.

The vulnerable code was introduced in the 3.2 version with the addition
of the QUIC protocol support.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are not affected by this issue,
as the QUIC implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

data to 16MB when using one-shot signing algorithms and reports success instead
of an error.

Impact summary: A user signing or verifying files larger than 16MB with
one-shot algorithms (such as Ed25519, Ed448, or ML-DSA) may believe the entire
file is authenticated while trailing data beyond 16MB remains unauthenticated.

When the 'openssl dgst' command is used with algorithms that only support
one-shot signing (Ed25519, Ed448, ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87), the input
is buffered with a 16MB limit. If the input exceeds this limit, the tool
silently truncates to the first 16MB and continues without signaling an error,
contrary to what the documentation states. This creates an integrity gap where
trailing bytes can be modified without detection if both signing and
verification are performed using the same affected codepath.

The issue affects only the command-line tool behavior. Verifiers that process
the full message using library APIs will reject the signature, so the risk
primarily affects workflows that both sign and verify with the affected
'openssl dgst' command. Streaming digest algorithms for 'openssl dgst' and
library users are unaffected.

The FIPS modules in 3.5 and 3.6 are not affected by this issue, as the
command-line tools are outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

forced to allocate a large buffer before decompression without checking
against the configured certificate size limit.

Impact summary: An attacker can cause per-connection memory allocations of
up to approximately 22 MiB and extra CPU work, potentially leading to
service degradation or resource exhaustion (Denial of Service).

In affected configurations, the peer-supplied uncompressed certificate
length from a CompressedCertificate message is used to grow a heap buffer
prior to decompression. This length is not bounded by the max_cert_list
setting, which otherwise constrains certificate message sizes. An attacker
can exploit this to cause large per-connection allocations followed by
handshake failure. No memory corruption or information disclosure occurs.

This issue only affects builds where TLS 1.3 certificate compression is
compiled in (i.e., not OPENSSL_NO_COMP_ALG) and at least one compression
algorithm (brotli, zlib, or zstd) is available, and where the compression
extension is negotiated. Both clients receiving a server CompressedCertificate
and servers in mutual TLS scenarios receiving a client CompressedCertificate
are affected. Servers that do not request client certificates are not
vulnerable to client-initiated attacks.

Users can mitigate this issue by setting SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION
to disable receiving compressed certificates.

line-buffering filter where the next BIO performs short writes can trigger
a heap-based out-of-bounds write.

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption which
typically results in a crash, leading to Denial of Service for an application.

The line-buffering BIO filter (BIO_f_linebuffer) is not used by default in
TLS/SSL data paths. In OpenSSL command-line applications, it is typically
only pushed onto stdout/stderr on VMS systems. Third-party applications that
explicitly use this filter with a BIO chain that can short-write and that
write large, newline-free data influenced by an attacker would be affected.
However, the circumstances where this could happen are unlikely to be under
attacker control, and BIO_f_linebuffer is unlikely to be handling non-curated
data controlled by an attacker. For that reason the issue was assessed as
Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,

The subsequent tail-handling code then operates on the original&lt;br /&gt;base pointers, effectively reprocessing the beginning of the buffer while&lt;br /&gt;leaving the actual trailing bytes unprocessed. The authentication checksum&lt;br /&gt;also excludes the true tail bytes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, typical OpenSSL consumers using EVP are not affected because the&lt;br /&gt;higher-level EVP and provider OCB implementations split inputs so that full&lt;br /&gt;blocks and trailing partial blocks are processed in separate calls, avoiding&lt;br /&gt;the problematic code path. Additionally, TLS does not use OCB ciphersuites.&lt;br /&gt;The vulnerability only affects applications that call the low-level&lt;br /&gt;CRYPTO_ocb128_encrypt() or CRYPTO_ocb128_decrypt() functions directly with&lt;br /&gt;non-block-aligned lengths in a single call on hardware-accelerated builds.&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected&lt;br /&gt;by this issue, as OCB mode is not a FIPS-approved algorithm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:15:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69419 | Out of bounds write in PKCS12_get_friendlyname() UTF-8 conversion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69419</link><description>Issue summary: Calling PKCS12_get_friendlyname() function on a maliciously
crafted PKCS#12 file with a BMPString (UTF-16BE) friendly name containing
non-ASCII BMP code point can trigger a one byte write before the allocated
buffer.

Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption
which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service.

The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12
BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes,
the helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16
source byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP
code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded
capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative
value is added to the output length without validation, causing the
length to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written
at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer.

The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API
when parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a
different code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly
invokes the vulnerable function. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide
a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the application and the attacker
can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer.
For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our
Security Policy.

verification code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first
validating the type, causing an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when
processing a malformed TimeStamp Response file.

Impact summary: An application calling TS_RESP_verify_response() with a

NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial of Service.

The functions ossl_ess_get_signing_cert() and ossl_ess_get_signing_cert_v2()

Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed

an application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file.

Impact summary: An application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can be
caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer on memory read, resulting
in a Denial of Service.

A type confusion vulnerability exists in PKCS#12 parsing code where
an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type,
causing an invalid pointer read.

The location is constrained to a 1-byte address space, meaning any
attempted pointer manipulation can only target addresses between 0x00 and 0xFF.
This range corresponds to the zero page, which is unmapped on most modern
operating systems and will reliably result in a crash, leading only to a
Denial of Service. Exploiting this issue also requires a user or application
to process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept
untrusted PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store
private keys which are trusted by definition. For these reasons, the issue
was assessed as Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
as the PKCS12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:15:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22796 | ASN1_TYPE Type Confusion in the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22796</link><description>Issue summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the signature
verification of signed PKCS#7 data where an ASN1_TYPE union member is
accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid or NULL
pointer dereference when processing malformed PKCS#7 data.

Impact summary: An application performing signature verification of PKCS#7
data or calling directly the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function can be
caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer when reading, resulting in
a Denial of Service.

The function PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() accesses the message digest attribute
value without validating its type. When the type is not V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING,
this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing
a crash.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed
signed PKCS#7 to an application that verifies it. The impact of the
exploit is just a Denial of Service, the PKCS7 API is legacy and applications
should be using the CMS API instead. For these reasons the issue was
assessed as Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
as the PKCS#7 parsing implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.

The issue stems from improper bounds checking when processing user domain information during the connection sequence. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack buffer and the return address, which could theoretically be used to redirect the execution flow. The impact of this vulnerability is lessened if a compiler flag has been used to build the xrdp executable with stack canary protection. If this is the case, a second vulnerability would need to be used to leak the stack canary value. Upgrade to version 0.10.5 to receive a patch. Additionally, do not rely on stack canary protection on production systems.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:15:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24870 | Information disclosure in ixray-1.6-stcop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24870</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in ixray-team ixray-1.6-stcop.This issue affects ixray-1.6-stcop: before 1.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:15:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24871 | Code injection in Minecraft-Rcon-Manage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24871</link><description>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in pilgrimage233 Minecraft-Rcon-Manage.This issue affects Minecraft-Rcon-Manage: before 3.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:15:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24872 | Pointer arithmetic error in SkyFire_548</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24872</link><description>improper pointer arithmetic

When it encounters an...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55095</link><description>The function _ux_host_class_storage_media_mount() is responsible for mounting partitions on a USB mass storage device. When it encounters an extended partition entry in the partition table, it recursively calls itself to mount the next logical partition.

This recursion occurs in _ux_host_class_storage_partition_read(), which parses up to four partition entries. If an extended partition is found (with type UX_HOST_CLASS_STORAGE_PARTITION_EXTENDED or EXTENDED_LBA_MAPPED), the code invokes:
            _ux_host_class_storage_media_mount(storage, sector + _ux_utility_long_get(...));


There is no limit on the recursion depth or tracking of visited sectors. As a result, a malicious or malformed disk image can include cyclic or excessively deep chains of extended partitions, causing the function to recurse until stack overflow occurs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:51:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0648 | The vulnerability stems from an incorrect error-checking logic in the CreateCounter() function (in threadx/utility/rtos_compatibility_layers...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0648</link><description>The vulnerability stems from an incorrect error-checking logic in the CreateCounter() function (in threadx/utility/rtos_compatibility_layers/OSEK/tx_osek.c) when handling the return value of osek_get_counter(). Specifically, the current code checks if cntr_id equals 0u to determine failure, but @osek_get_counter() actually returns E_OS_SYS_STACK (defined as 12U) when it fails. This mismatch causes the error branch to never execute even when the counter pool is exhausted.

As a result, when the counter pool is depleted, the code proceeds to cast the error code (12U) to a pointer (OSEK_COUNTER *), creating a wild pointer. Subsequent writes to members of this pointer lead to writes to illegal memory addresses (e.g., 0x0000000C), which can trigger immediate HardFaults or silent memory corruption.

This vulnerability poses significant risks, including potential denial-of-service attacks (via repeated calls to exhaust the counter pool) and unauthorized memory access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:51:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24831 | Infinite loop (DoS) in ixray-1.6-stcop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24831</link><description>Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') vulnerability in ixray-team ixray-1.6-stcop.This issue affects ixray-1.6-stcop: before 1.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:51:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24832 | Out-of-bounds write in ixray-1.6-stcop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24832</link><description>Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in ixray-team ixray-1.6-stcop.This issue affects ixray-1.6-stcop: before 1.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:51:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36938 | WinAVR Version 20100110 - Insecure Folder Permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36938</link><description>WinAVR version 20100110 contains an insecure permissions vulnerability that allows authenticated users to modify system files and executables.

This vulnerability, known as CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) Injection, occurs when an HTTP proxy is configured and the library improperly handles URL-decoded input used to create the Host header. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL containing CRLF sequences, allowing them to inject additional HTTP headers or complete HTTP request bodies. This can lead to unintended or unauthorized HTTP requests being forwarded by the proxy, potentially impacting downstream services.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24345 | Cross-Site Request Forgery in EZCast Pro II Dongle</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24345</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery in Admin UI of EZCast Pro II version 1.17478.146 allows attackers to bypass authorization checks and gain full access to the admin UI</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24346 | Use of well-known default credentials in EZCast Pro II Dongle</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24346</link><description>Use of well-known default credentials in Admin UI of EZCast Pro II version 1.17478.146 allows attackers to access protected areas in the web application</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24826 | Out-of-bounds write in turso3d</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24826</link><description>Out-of-bounds Write, Divide By Zero, NULL Pointer Dereference, Use of Uninitialized Resource, Out-of-bounds Read, Reachable Assertion vulnerability in cadaver turso3d.This issue affects .</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24827 | Out-of-bounds write in Commander-Genius</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24827</link><description>Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in gerstrong Commander-Genius.This issue affects Commander-Genius: before Release refs/pull/358/merge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24828 | Memory leak in is-Engine</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24828</link><description>Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Is-Daouda is-Engine.This issue affects is-Engine: before 3.3.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24829 | Out-of-bounds write in is-Engine</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24829</link><description>Out-of-bounds Write, Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Is-Daouda is-Engine.This issue affects is-Engine: before 3.3.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:46:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21720 | Unauthenticated DoS: avatar cache leaks goroutines when /avatar/:hash requests time out</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21720</link><description>Every uncached /avatar/:hash request spawns a goroutine that refreshes the Gravatar image.

Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 3.27.7, an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in `org.assertj.core.util.xml.XmlStringPrettyFormatter`: the `toXmlDocument(String)` method initializes `DocumentBuilderFactory` with default settings, without disabling DTDs or external entities. This formatter is used by the `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` assertion for `CharSequence` values. An application is vulnerable only when it uses untrusted XML input with either `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` from `org.assertj.core.api.AbstractCharSequenceAssert` or `xmlPrettyFormat(String)` from `org.assertj.core.util.xml.XmlStringPrettyFormatter`. If untrusted XML input is processed by tone of these methods, an attacker couldnread arbitrary local files via `file://` URIs (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, application configuration files); perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTTP/HTTPS URIs, and/or cause Denial of Service via "Billion Laughs" entity expansion attacks. `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` has been deprecated in favor of XMLUnit in version 3.18.0 and will be removed in version 4.0. Users of affected versions should, in order of preference: replace `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` with XMLUnit, upgrade to version 3.27.7, or avoid using `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` or `XmlStringPrettyFormatter` with untrusted input. `XmlStringPrettyFormatter` has historically been considered a utility for `isXmlEqualTo(CharSequence)` rather than a feature for AssertJ users, so it is deprecated in version 3.27.7 and removed in version 4.0, with no replacement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:44:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24408 | sigstore has CSRF possibility in OIDC authentication during signing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24408</link><description>sigstore-python is a Python tool for generating and verifying Sigstore signatures.

The PPR resume endpoint accepts unauthenticated POST requests with the `Next-Resume: 1` header and processes attacker-controlled postponed state data. Two closely related vulnerabilities allow an attacker to crash the server process through memory exhaustion:

1. **Unbounded request body buffering**: The server buffers the entire POST request body into memory using `Buffer.concat()` without enforcing any size limit, allowing arbitrarily large payloads to exhaust available memory.

2. **Unbounded decompression (zipbomb)**: The resume data cache is decompressed using `inflateSync()` without limiting the decompressed output size. A small compressed payload can expand to hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes, causing memory exhaustion.

Both attack vectors result in a fatal V8 out-of-memory error (`FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory`) causing the Node.js process to terminate. The zipbomb variant is particularly dangerous as it can bypass reverse proxy request size limits while still causing large memory allocation on the server.

To be affected you must have an application running with `experimental.ppr: true` or `cacheComponents: true` configured along with the NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1 environment variable.

A vulnerability present in versions prior to 0.3.9 involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl. The library fetches QE Identity collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report. An attacker can forge the QE Identity data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting Enclave. This allows the attacker to forge the QE and sign untrusted quotes that the verifier will accept as valid. Effectively, this bypasses the entire remote attestation security model, as the verifier can no longer trust the entity responsible for signing the quotes. All deployments utilizing the dcap-qvl library for SGX or TDX quote verification are affected. The vulnerability has been patched in dcap-qvl version 0.3.9. The fix implements the missing cryptographic verification for the QE Identity signature and enforces the required checks for MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, and ISVSVN against the QE Report. Users of the `@phala/dcap-qvl-node` and `@phala/dcap-qvl-web` packages should switch to the pure JavaScript implementation, `@phala/dcap-qvl`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users must upgrade to the patched version to ensure that QE Identity collateral is properly verified.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:42:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22709 | vm2 has a Sandbox Escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22709</link><description>vm2 is an open source vm/sandbox for Node.js. In vm2 prior to version 3.10.2, `Promise.prototype.then` `Promise.prototype.catch` callback sanitization can be bypassed. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code.

This algorithm uses a simple XOR encryption technique combined with a cryptographic key (cryptoKey) to transform each character of the input string. However, it's important to note that this implementation does not provide strong encryption and should not be considered secure for sensitive data. It's more of a custom encryption approach rather than a common algorithm used in cryptographic applications. The key itself is static and based on the founder's name of the company. The functionality is for example used to encrypt the user PINs before storing them in the MSSQL database.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59096 | Weak Default Password in dormakaba Kaba exos 9300</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59096</link><description>The default password for the extended admin user mode in the application U9ExosAdmin.exe ("Kaba 9300 Administration") is hard-coded in multiple locations as well as documented in the locally stored user documentation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59097 | Unauthenticated SOAP API in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59097</link><description>The exos 9300 application can be used to configure Access Managers (e.g. 92xx, 9230 and 9290). The configuration is done in a graphical user interface on the dormakaba exos server. As soon as the save button is clicked in exos 9300, the whole configuration is sent to the selected Access Manager via SOAP. The SOAP request is sent without any prior authentication or authorization by default. Though authentication and authorization can be configured using IPsec for 92xx-K5 devices and mTLS for 92xx-K7 devices, it is not enabled by default and must therefore be activated with additional steps.

This insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:
- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)
- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs
- Open all connected doors permanently
- Open all doors for a defined time interval
- Change the admin password
- and many more

Network level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls. Devices with an insecure configuration have been identified to be directly exposed to the internet.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59098 | Trace Functionality Leaking Sensitive Data in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59098</link><description>The Access Manager is offering a trace functionality to debug errors and issues with the device. The trace functionality is implemented as a simple TCP socket. A tool called TraceClient.exe, provided by dormakaba via the Access Manager web interface, is used to connect to the socket and receive debug information. The data is permanently broadcasted on the TCP socket. The socket can be accessed without any authentication or encryption. 

The transmitted data is based on the set verbosity level. The verbosity level can be set using the http(s) endpoint with the service interface password or with the guessable identifier of the device via the SOAP interface.

The transmitted data contains sensitive data like the Card ID as well as all button presses on Registration units. This allows an attacker with network level access to retrieve all entered PINs on a registration unit.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59099 | Unauthenticated Path Traversal in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59099</link><description>The Access Manager is using the open source web server CompactWebServer written in C#. This web server is affected by a path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to directly access files via simple GET requests without prior authentication. 

Hence, it is possible to retrieve all files stored on the file system, including the SQLite database Database.sq3, containing badge information and the corresponding PIN codes. Additionally, when trying to access certain files, the web server crashes and becomes unreachable for about 60 seconds. This can be abused to continuously send the request and cause denial of service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59100 | Unauthenticated Access to the SQLite Database in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59100</link><description>The web interface offers a functionality to export the internal SQLite database. After executing the database export, an automatic download is started and the device reboots. After rebooting, the exported database is deleted and cannot be accessed anymore. However, it was noticed that sometimes the device does not reboot and therefore the exported database is not deleted, or the device reboots and the export is not deleted for unknown reasons. The path where the database export is located can be accessed without prior authentication. This leads to the fact that an attacker might be able to get access to the exported database without prior authentication. 
The database includes sensitive data like passwords, card pins, encrypted Mifare sitekeys and much more.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59101 | Insufficient Session Management in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59101</link><description>Instead of typical session tokens or cookies, it is verified on a per-request basis if the originating IP address has once successfully logged in.

Combined with the fact that an attacker can easily get access to the backup functionality by abusing the session management issue (CVE-2025-59101), or by exploiting the weak default password (CVE-2025-59108), or by simply setting a new password without prior authentication via the SOAP API (CVE-2025-59097), it is easily possible to access the sensitive data on the device.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59103 | Weak Default Passwords for SSH Access in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59103</link><description>The Access Manager 92xx in hardware revision K7 is based on Linux instead of Windows CE embedded in older hardware revisions. In this new hardware revision it was noticed that an SSH service is exposed on port 22. By analyzing the firmware of the devices, it was noticed that there are two users with hardcoded and weak passwords that can be used to access the devices via SSH. The passwords can be also guessed very easily. The password of at least one user is set to a random value after the first deployment, with the restriction that the password is only randomized if the configured date is prior to 2022. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the passwords are not randomized. For example, if the clock is never set on the device, the battery of the clock module has been changed, the Access Manager has been factory reset and has not received a time yet.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59104 | Unlocked Bootloader in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59104</link><description>With physical access to the device and enough time an attacker is able to solder test leads to the debug footprint (or use the 6-Pin tag-connect cable).

dmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free

A use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams
are terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs
when the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the
vchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.

The race condition follows this sequence:

  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the
     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)
  2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which
     frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()
  3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()
     which attempts to access the already-freed memory

Since tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is
no guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete()
runs.

Fix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:
 - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the
   descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.
 - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls
   vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any
   terminated descriptors.

nvme-tcp: fix NULL pointer dereferences in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec

Commit efa56305908b ("nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length")
added ttag bounds checking and data_offset
validation in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), but it did not validate
whether the command's data structures (cmd-&gt;req.sg and cmd-&gt;iov) have
been properly initialized before processing H2C_DATA PDUs.

The nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() function dereferences these pointers
without NULL checks. This can be triggered by sending H2C_DATA PDU
immediately after the ICREQ/ICRESP handshake, before
sending a CONNECT command or NVMe write command.

Attack vectors that trigger NULL pointer dereferences:
1. H2C_DATA PDU sent before CONNECT → both pointers NULL
2. H2C_DATA PDU for READ command → cmd-&gt;req.sg allocated, cmd-&gt;iov NULL
3. H2C_DATA PDU for uninitialized command slot → both pointers NULL

The fix validates both cmd-&gt;req.sg and cmd-&gt;iov before calling
nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec(). Both checks are required because:
- Uninitialized commands: both NULL
- READ commands: cmd-&gt;req.sg allocated, cmd-&gt;iov NULL
- WRITE commands: both allocated</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22999 | net/sched: sch_qfq: do not free existing class in qfq_change_class()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22999</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix crash on profile change rollback failure

mlx5e_netdev_change_profile can fail to attach a new profile and can
fail to rollback to old profile, in such case, we could end up with a
dangling netdev with a fully reset netdev_priv. A retry to change
profile, e.g. another attempt to call mlx5e_netdev_change_profile via
switchdev mode change, will crash trying to access the now NULL
priv-&gt;mdev.

This fix allows mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() to handle previous
failures and an empty priv, by not assuming priv is valid.

Pass netdev and mdev to all flows requiring
mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() and avoid passing priv.
In mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() check if current priv is valid, and if
not, just attach the new profile without trying to access the old one.

This fixes the following oops, when enabling switchdev mode for the 2nd
time after first time failure:

macvlan: fix possible UAF in macvlan_forward_source()

Add RCU protection on (struct macvlan_source_entry)-&gt;vlan.

Whenever macvlan_hash_del_source() is called, we must clear
entry-&gt;vlan pointer before RCU grace period starts.

This allows macvlan_forward_source() to skip over
entries queued for freeing.

Note that macvlan_dev are already RCU protected, as they
are embedded in a standard netdev (netdev_priv(ndev)).

lib/buildid: use __kernel_read() for sleepable context

Prevent a "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference in
filemap_read_folio".

For the sleepable context, convert freader to use __kernel_read() instead
of direct page cache access via read_cache_folio().  This simplifies the
faultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface
which handles all the complexity of reading file data.

At the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which
uses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are
already in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple
and easier to backport to stable kernels.

Syzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run
successfully.

In the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for
non-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the
secretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the
buildid code.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23003 | ip6_tunnel: use skb_vlan_inet_prepare() in __ip6_tnl_rcv()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23003</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dst: fix races in rt6_uncached_list_del() and rt_del_uncached_list()

syzbot was able to crash the kernel in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()
in an interesting way [1]

Crash happens in list_del_init()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() while writing
list-&gt;prev, while the prior write on list-&gt;next went well.

static inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;next, list); // This went well
	WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;prev, list); // Crash, @list has been freed.
}

Issue here is that rt6_uncached_list_del() did not attempt to lock
ul-&gt;lock, as list_empty(&amp;amp;rt-&gt;dst.rt_uncached) returned
true because the WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;next, list) happened on the other CPU.

We might use list_del_init_careful() and list_empty_careful(),
or make sure rt6_uncached_list_del() always grabs the spinlock
whenever rt-&gt;dst.rt_uncached_list has been set.

A similar fix is neeed for IPv4.

x86/fpu: Clear XSTATE_BV[i] in guest XSAVE state whenever XFD[i]=1

When loading guest XSAVE state via KVM_SET_XSAVE, and when updating XFD in
response to a guest WRMSR, clear XFD-disabled features in the saved (or to
be restored) XSTATE_BV to ensure KVM doesn't attempt to load state for
features that are disabled via the guest's XFD.  Because the kernel
executes XRSTOR with the guest's XFD, saving XSTATE_BV[i]=1 with XFD[i]=1
will cause XRSTOR to #NM and panic the kernel.

E.g. if fpu_update_guest_xfd() sets XFD without clearing XSTATE_BV:

The new behavior is consistent with the AMX architecture.  Per Intel's SDM,
XSAVE saves XSTATE_BV as '0' for components that are disabled via XFD
(and non-compacted XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the state
component):

  If XSAVE, XSAVEC, XSAVEOPT, or XSAVES is saving the state component i,
  the instruction does not generate #NM when XCR0[i] = IA32_XFD[i] = 1;
  instead, it operates as if XINUSE[i] = 0 (and the state component was
  in its initial state): it saves bit i of XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE
  header as 0; in addition, XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the
  state component (the other instructions do not save state component i).

Alternatively, KVM could always do XRSTOR with XFD=0, e.g. by using
a constant XFD based on the set of enabled features when XSAVEing for
a struct fpu_guest.  However, having XSTATE_BV[i]=1 for XFD-disabled
features can only happen in the above interrupt case, or in similar
scenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, because
fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate()'s call to save_fpregs_to_fpstate() saves the
outgoing FPU state with the current XFD; and that is (on all but the
first WRMSR to XFD) the guest XFD.

Therefore, XFD can only go out of sync with XSTATE_BV in the above
interrupt case, or in similar scenarios involving preemption on
preemptible kernels, and it we can consider it (de facto) part of KVM
ABI that KVM_GET_XSAVE returns XSTATE_BV[i]=0 for XFD-disabled features.

block: zero non-PI portion of auto integrity buffer

The auto-generated integrity buffer for writes needs to be fully
initialized before being passed to the underlying block device,
otherwise the uninitialized memory can be read back by userspace or
anyone with physical access to the storage device. If protection
information is generated, that portion of the integrity buffer is
already initialized. The integrity data is also zeroed if PI generation
is disabled via sysfs or the PI tuple size is 0. However, this misses
the case where PI is generated and the PI tuple size is nonzero, but the
metadata size is larger than the PI tuple. In this case, the remainder
("opaque") of the metadata is left uninitialized.
Generalize the BLK_INTEGRITY_CSUM_NONE check to cover any case when the
metadata is larger than just the PI tuple.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23008 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix KMS with 3D on HW version 10</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xhci: sideband: don't dereference freed ring when removing sideband endpoint

xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint() incorrecly assumes that the endpoint is
running and has a valid transfer ring.

Lianqin reported a crash during suspend/wake-up stress testing, and
found the cause to be dereferencing a non-existing transfer ring
'ep-&gt;ring' during xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint().

The endpoint and its ring may be in unknown state if this function
is called after xHCI was reinitialized in resume (lost power), or if
device is being re-enumerated, disconnected or endpoint already dropped.

Fix this by both removing unnecessary ring access, and by checking
ep-&gt;ring exists before dereferencing it. Also make sure endpoint is
running before attempting to stop it.

Remove the xhci_initialize_ring_info() call during sideband endpoint
removal as is it only initializes ring structure enqueue, dequeue and
cycle state values to their starting values without changing actual
hardware enqueue, dequeue and cycle state. Leaving them out of sync
is worse than leaving it as it is. The endpoint will get freed in after
this in most usecases.

If the (audio) class driver want's to reuse the endpoint after offload
then it is up to the class driver to ensure endpoint is properly set up.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23010 | ipv6: Fix use-after-free in inet6_addr_del().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: ip_gre: make ipgre_header() robust

Analog to commit db5b4e39c4e6 ("ip6_gre: make ip6gre_header() robust")

Over the years, syzbot found many ways to crash the kernel
in ipgre_header() [1].

This involves team or bonding drivers ability to dynamically
change their dev-&gt;needed_headroom and/or dev-&gt;hard_header_len

In this particular crash mld_newpack() allocated an skb
with a too small reserve/headroom, and by the time mld_sendpack()
was called, syzbot managed to attach an ipgre device.

mm/damon/core: remove call_control in inactive contexts

If damon_call() is executed against a DAMON context that is not running,
the function returns error while keeping the damon_call_control object
linked to the context's call_controls list.  Let's suppose the object is
deallocated after the damon_call(), and yet another damon_call() is
executed against the same context.  The function tries to add the new
damon_call_control object to the call_controls list, which still has the
pointer to the previous damon_call_control object, which is deallocated. 
As a result, use-after-free happens.

This can actually be triggered using the DAMON sysfs interface.  It is not
easily exploitable since it requires the sysfs write permission and making
a definitely weird file writes, though.  Please refer to the report for
more details about the issue reproduction steps.

Fix the issue by making two changes.  Firstly, move the final
kdamond_call() for cancelling all existing damon_call() requests from
terminating DAMON context to be done before the ctx-&gt;kdamond reset.  This
makes any code that sees NULL ctx-&gt;kdamond can safely assume the context
may not access damon_call() requests anymore.  Secondly, let damon_call()
to cleanup the damon_call_control objects that were added to the
already-terminated DAMON context, before returning the error.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23013 | net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23013</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback

octep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue IRQs with dev_id set to
ioq_vector. If request_irq() fails part-way, the rollback loop calls
free_irq() with dev_id set to 'oct', which does not match the original
dev_id and may leave the irqaction registered.

This can keep IRQ handlers alive while ioq_vector is later freed during
unwind/teardown, leading to a use-after-free or crash when an interrupt
fires.

Fix the error path to free IRQs with the same ioq_vector dev_id used
