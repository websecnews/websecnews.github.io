From version 0.15.0 to before 0.19.2, a vulnerability was discovered where the List() calls for Kubernetes Secret and SecretStore resources performed by the PushSecret controller did not apply a namespace selector. This flaw allowed an attacker to use label selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across the cluster, bypassing intended namespace restrictions. An attacker with the ability to create or update PushSecret resources and control SecretStore configurations could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive data from arbitrary namespaces. This could lead to full disclosure of Kubernetes secrets, including credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the cluster. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround for this issue includes auditing and restricting RBAC permissions so that only trusted service accounts can create or update PushSecret and SecretStore resources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 23:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55193 | Active Record logging vulnerable to ANSI escape injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55193</link><description>Active Record connects classes to relational database tables.

By opening streams and then rapidly triggering the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an attacker can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the server are considered closed at the protocol level, even though backend processing continues. This allows a client to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection. This CVE will be updated as affected product details are released.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55280 | Information Disclosure Vulnerability in ZKTeco WL20</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55280</link><description>This vulnerability exists in ZKTeco WL20 due to storage of Wi-Fi credentials, configuration data and system data in plaintext within the device firmware.

Prior to version 0.8.3, the debug pack generated by Autocaliweb can expose sensitive configuration data, including API keys. This occurs because the to_dict() method, used to serialize configuration for the debug pack, doesn't adequately filter out sensitive fields such as API tokens. Users, unaware of the full contents, might share these debug packs, inadvertently leaking their private API keys. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:11:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54187 | Substance3D - Painter | Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54187</link><description>Substance3D - Painter versions 11.0.2 and earlier are affected by an out-of-bounds write vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface

collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation,
thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces.

The check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was
returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md
interface, and thus the validation was never reached.

Calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi
in the xfrmi_net-&gt;xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the
xfrmi_net-&gt;collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when
the net namespace was taken down [1].

Change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier
in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.

This vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to bypass access controls and perform a limited set of actions typically reserved for higher privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized data modifications. This issue is addressed in the listed patches and family releases, which have been made available to hosted and self-hosted customers, as well as partners.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55164 | content-security-policy-parser Prototype Pollution Vulnerability May Lead to RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55164</link><description>content-security-policy-parser parses content security policy directives. A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier, wherein if a policy name is called __proto__, one can override the Object prototype. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0. A workaround involves disabling prototype method in NodeJS, neutralizing all possible prototype pollution attacks. Provide either --disable-proto=delete (recommended) or --disable-proto=throw as an argument to node to enable this feature.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55010 | Kanboard Authenticated Admin Remote Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization of Events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55010</link><description>Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the ProjectEventActvityFormatter allows admin users the ability to instantiate arbitrary php objects by modifying the event["data"] field in the project_activities table. A malicious actor can update this field to use a php gadget to write a web shell into the /plugins folder, which then gives remote code execution on the host system. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55011 | Kanboard Path Traversal in File Write via Task File Upload Api</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55011</link><description>Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, the createTaskFile method in the API does not validate whether the task_id parameter is a valid task id, nor does it check for path traversal. As a result, a malicious actor could write a file anywhere on the system the app user controls. The impact is limited due to the filename being hashed and having no extension. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54864 | Hydra missing authentication when triggering evaluations through GitHub and Gitea plugins</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54864</link><description>Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit f7bda02, /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea are called by the corresponding forge without HTTP Basic authentication. Both forges do however feature HMAC signing with a secret key. Triggering an evaluation can be very taxing on the infrastructure when large evaluations are done, introducing potential denial of service attacks on the host running the evaluator. This issue has been patched by commit f7bda02. A workaround involves blocking /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea via a reverse proxy.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:59:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54800 | Hydra persistent XSS in build metrics</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54800</link><description>Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8452 | Unauthenticated leak of sensitive information affecting multiple models from Brother Industries, Ltd., FUJIFILM Business Innovation, Ricoh, Toshiba Tec, and Konica Minolta, Inc.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8452</link><description>By using the "uscan" protocol provided by the eSCL specification, an attacker can discover the serial number of multi-function printers that implement the Brother-provided firmware.
