Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in `$this-&gt;_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this-&gt;_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 22:33:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2514 | MAGESH-K21 Online-College-Event-Hall-Reservation-System login.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2514</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in MAGESH-K21 Online-College-Event-Hall-Reservation-System 1.0.

valid connections after that.

This behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de ("neighbor:

Currenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this
only happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to
guard against memory corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate.

Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, it
just prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the short
while after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable
and correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47111 | xen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47111</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Error injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling

we insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the
other side.  If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the first
one dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind.  Fix this by
aborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47114 | ocfs2: fix data corruption by fallocate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47114</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix data corruption by fallocate

When fallocate punches holes out of inode size, if original isize is in
the middle of last cluster, then the part from isize to the end of the
cluster will be zeroed with buffer write, at that time isize is not yet
updated to match the new size, if writeback is kicked in, it will invoke
ocfs2_writepage()-&gt;block_write_full_page() where the pages out of inode
size will be dropped.  That will cause file corruption.  Fix this by
zero out eof blocks when extending the inode size.

Running the following command with qemu-image 4.2.1 can get a corrupted
coverted image file easily.

    qemu-img convert -p -t none -T none -f qcow2 $qcow_image \
             -O qcow2 -o compat=1.1 $qcow_image.conv

The usage of fallocate in qemu is like this, it first punches holes out
of inode size, then extend the inode size.

    fallocate(11, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 2276196352, 65536) = 0

"I see. Now I understand your patch. Honestly, seeing how fragile is trying
to fix extent tree after split has failed in the middle, I would probably
go even further and make sure we fix the tree properly in case of ENOSPC
and EDQUOT (those are easily user triggerable).  Anything else indicates a
HW problem or fs corruption so I'd rather leave the extent tree as is and
don't try to fix it (which also means we will not create overlapping
extents)."</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47118 | pid: take a reference when initializing `cad_pid`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47118</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pid: take a reference when initializing `cad_pid`

During boot, kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the init
task's struct pid.  Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, and
when this happens proc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on the
new pid via get_pid(), and will decrement the refcount on the old pid
via put_pid().  As we never called get_pid() when we initialized
`cad_pid`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can therefore
free the init task's struct pid early.  As there can be dangling
references to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free
(e.g.  when delivering signals).

This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to
have been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in
commit 9ec52099e4b8 ("[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid") from the
pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.

Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when we
assign it to `cad_pid`.

ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super

Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not
be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.

If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and
page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread
again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't
fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were
not freed and instead leaked.

This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:

  systemctl start &lt;ext4_on_lvm&gt;.mount, and
  systemctl stop &lt;ext4_on_lvm&gt;.mount

... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and
the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never
gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47120 | HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47120</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_htb: fix refcount leak in htb_parent_to_leaf_offload

The commit ae81feb7338c ("sch_htb: fix null pointer dereference
on a null new_q") fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug, but it
is not correct.

Because htb_graft_helper properly handles the case when new_q
is NULL, and after the previous patch by skipping this call
which creates an inconsistency : dev_queue-&gt;qdisc will still
point to the old qdisc, but cl-&gt;parent-&gt;leaf.q will point to
the new one (which will be noop_qdisc, because new_q was NULL).
The code is based on an assumption that these two pointers are
the same, so it can lead to refcount leaks.

The correct fix is to add a NULL pointer check to protect
qdisc_refcount_inc inside htb_parent_to_leaf_offload.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47126 | ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47126</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit c7a219048e45 ("ice: Remove xsk_buff_pool from VSI structure")
silently introduced a regression and broke the Tx side of AF_XDP in copy
mode. xsk_pool on ice_ring is set only based on the existence of the XDP
prog on the VSI which in turn picks ice_clean_tx_irq_zc to be executed.
That is not something that should happen for copy mode as it should use
the regular data path ice_clean_tx_irq.

This results in a following splat when xdpsock is run in txonly or l2fwd
scenarios in copy mode:

Fix this by introducing the bitmap of queues that are zero-copy enabled,
where each bit, corresponding to a queue id that xsk pool is being
configured on, will be set/cleared within ice_xsk_pool_{en,dis}able and
checked within ice_xsk_pool(). The latter is a function used for
deciding which napi poll routine is executed.
Idea is being taken from our other drivers such as i40e and ixgbe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47128 | bpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks

Commit 59438b46471a ("security,lockdown,selinux: implement SELinux lockdown")
added an implementation of the locked_down LSM hook to SELinux, with the aim
to restrict which domains are allowed to perform operations that would breach
lockdown. This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report
events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it
can bring down the whole system via audit:

  1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security_locked_down()
     can OOM kill a machine, see below details [0].

  2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc_has_perm()/slow_avc_audit()
     when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace_sched_switch()
     tracepoint, see details in [1]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical
     corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat &amp; runqslower from bcc, for
     example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:

     rq_lock(rq) -&gt; -------------------------+
       trace_sched_switch() -&gt;               |
         bpf_prog_xyz() -&gt;                   +-&gt; deadlock
           selinux_lockdown() -&gt;             |
             audit_log_end() -&gt;              |
               wake_up_interruptible() -&gt;    |
                 try_to_wake_up() -&gt;         |
                   rq_lock(rq) --------------+

What's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown
settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is
completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check
looks something like this:

  allow &lt;who&gt; &lt;who&gt; : lockdown { &lt;reason&gt; };

However, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()
is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached
to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a
bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does
the permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd
has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical
having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper
pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing
the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall
counts by user space application:

  bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way
of doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()
helper and then access current-&gt;comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()
helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random
app doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown
check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you
want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the
system like my_random_tracer _not_.

Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different
approach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the
program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This
also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing
program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since
we're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several
millions of times per second.

The check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the
system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,
open_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures

Add the ct helper extension only for unconfirmed conntrack. Skip rule
evaluation if the ct helper extension does not exist. Thus, you can
only create expectations from the first packet.

It should be possible to remove this limitation by adding a new action
to attach a generic ct helper to the first packet. Then, use this ct
helper extension from follow up packets to create the ct expectation.

While at it, add a missing check to skip the template conntrack too
and remove check for IPCT_UNTRACK which is implicit to !ct.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47130 | nvmet: fix freeing unallocated p2pmem</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47130</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up

When a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is
called to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the
socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now
deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,
and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will
lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.

This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its
normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the
connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.

On the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX
side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving
non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is
to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving
non-decrypted packets.

The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:
first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released
(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).

A new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback
mode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes
useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,
which is allocated and freed by the driver).</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47132 | mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47132</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission

MPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field
is protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain
socket lock.

Currently we have a code path updating such field without handling
the relevant lock:

__mptcp_retrans() -&gt; __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()

Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update
sk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, as reported
by Matthieu.

Address the issue providing and using a new variant of blamed function
which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:27:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47133 | HID: amd_sfh: Fix memory leak in amd_sfh_work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47133</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE.

Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:18:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51699 | OS Command Injection for Fluid Users with JuicefsRuntime</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51699</link><description>Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native Distributed Dataset Orchestrator and Accelerator for data-intensive applications. An OS command injection vulnerability within the Fluid project's JuicefsRuntime can potentially allow an authenticated user, who has the authority to create or update the K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime, to execute arbitrary OS commands within the juicefs related containers. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of data. Users who're using versions &lt; 0.9.3 with JuicefsRuntime should upgrade to v0.9.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28252 | CoreWCF NetFraming based services can leave connections open when they should be closed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28252</link><description>CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.3 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28851 | Elevation of privilege in Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector Helper script</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28851</link><description>The Snowflake Hive metastore connector provides an easy way to query Hive-managed data via Snowflake. Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector has addressed a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a `helper script` for the Hive MetaStore Connector. A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the helper script.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:11:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28854 | Slow loris vulnerability with default configuration in tls-listener</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28854</link><description>tls-listener is a rust lang wrapper around a connection listener to support TLS. With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter to `Builder::max_handshakes`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 18:58:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7060 | Missing Security Control in Zephyr OS IP Packet Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7060</link><description>Zephyr OS IP packet handling does not properly drop IP packets arriving on an external interface with a source address equal to 127.0.01 or the destination address.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 18:20:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2193 | Speculative Race Condition impacts modern CPU architectures that support speculative execution, also known as GhostRace.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2193</link><description>A Speculative Race Condition (SRC) vulnerability that impacts modern CPU architectures supporting speculative execution (related to Spectre V1) has been disclosed.

It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 10:33:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27987 | WordPress Give plugin &amp;lt;= 3.3.1 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27987</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in GiveWP Give allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Give: from n/a through 3.3.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 10:33:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28752 | Apache CXF SSRF Vulnerability using the Aegis databinding</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28752</link><description>A SSRF vulnerability using the Aegis DataBinding in versions of Apache CXF before 4.0.4, 3.6.3 and 3.5.8 allows an attacker to perform SSRF style attacks on webservices that take at least one parameter of any type.

It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang `#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it'll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file  `$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed.
An attacker could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:42:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42938 | A logic issue was addressed with improved checks.

TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround advice.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28849 | Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts in follow-redirects</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28849</link><description>follow-redirects is an open source, drop-in replacement for Node's `http` and `https` modules that automatically follows redirects.
