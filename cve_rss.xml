The Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the “aggregations” object. The ‘name’ field in this “aggregations” object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries.  This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22407 | Broken Access Control order API in Shopware</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22407</link><description>Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. In the Shopware CMS, the state handler for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate implementation, users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change the order state. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22408 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Shopware Flow Builder</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22408</link><description>Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The implemented Flow Builder functionality in the Shopware application does not adequately validate the URL used when creating the “call webhook” action. This enables malicious users to perform web requests to internal hosts. This issue has been fixed in the Commercial Plugin release 6.5.7.4 or with the Security Plugin. For installations with Shopware 6.4 the Security plugin is recommended to be installed and up to date. For older versions of 6.4 and 6.5 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:41:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51807 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in OFCMS v.1.14 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the tit...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51807</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in OFCMS v.1.14 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the title addition component.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:31:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22409 | Default Privileges allow for high level operations for low privileged users in datahub</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22409</link><description>DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions a low privileged user could remove a user, edit group members, or edit another user's profile information. The default privileges gave too many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have been constrained in PR #9067 to prevent abuse. This issue can result in privilege escalation for lower privileged users up to admin privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges exists. May not impact instances that have modified default privileges. This issue has been addressed in datahub version 0.12.1. Users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:31:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-36236 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in webkil Bagisto v.1.5.0 and before allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36236</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in webkil Bagisto v.1.5.0 and before allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file uplad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22916 | In D-LINK Go-RT-AC750 v101b03, the sprintf function in the sub_40E700 function within the cgibin is susceptible to stack overflow.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22916</link><description>In D-LINK Go-RT-AC750 v101b03, the sprintf function in the sub_40E700 function within the cgibin is susceptible to stack overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0603 | ZhiCms giftcontroller.php deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0603</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in ZhiCms up to 4.0.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the key_value field of Avo v3.2.3. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. The value of the key_value is inserted directly into the HTML code. In the current version of Avo (possibly also older versions), the value is not properly sanitized before it is inserted into the HTML code. This vulnerability could be used to steal sensitive information from victims that could be used to hijack victims' accounts or redirect them to malicious websites. Avo 3.2.4 includes a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 22:16:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22411 | Cross site scripting in Action messages on Avo</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22411</link><description>Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the UI on Action completion.

is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. A weakness in the Hyperledger AnonCreds specification that is not mitigated in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations is that the Issuer does not publish a key correctness proof demonstrating that a generated private key is sufficient to meet the unlinkability guarantees of AnonCreds. The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds credentials implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations of CL Signatures. The ursa project has has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 21:47:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0601 | ZhongFuCheng3y Austin Email Message Template AustinFileUtils.java getRemoteUrl2File server-side request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0601</link><description>A vulnerability was found in ZhongFuCheng3y Austin 1.0.

The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-proccess.

The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission.
