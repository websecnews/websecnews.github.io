A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.11 when deserializing .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with attacker-controlled payload lengths. While MessagePack-Java parses extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared EXT payload length when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData() is invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared length without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only a few bytes can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in JVM heap exhaustion, process termination, or service unavailability. This vulnerability is triggered during model loading / deserialization, making it a model format vulnerability suitable for remote exploitation. The vulnerability enables a remote denial-of-service attack against applications that deserialize untrusted .msgpack model files using MessagePack for Java. A specially crafted but syntactically valid .msgpack file containing an EXT32 object with an attacker-controlled, excessively large payload length can trigger unbounded memory allocation during deserialization. When the model file is loaded, the library trusts the declared length metadata and attempts to allocate a byte array of that size, leading to rapid heap exhaustion, excessive garbage collection, or immediate JVM termination with an OutOfMemoryError. The attack requires no malformed bytes, user interaction, or elevated privileges and can be exploited remotely in real-world environments such as model registries, inference services, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-based model hosting platforms that accept or fetch .msgpack artifacts. Because the malicious file is extremely small yet valid, it can bypass basic validation and scanning mechanisms, resulting in complete service unavailability and potential cascading failures in production systems. Version 0.9.11 fixes the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 21:09:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21450 | Bagisto has SSTI in parameter that can lead to RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21450</link><description>Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform.

In versions on the 2.3 branch prior to 2.3.10, API routes remain active even after initial installation is complete. The underlying API endpoints (`/install/api/*`) are directly accessible and exploitable without any authentication. An attacker can bypass the Ib installer entirely by calling the API endpoints directly. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts, modify application configurations, and potentially overwrite existing data. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:29:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21445 | Langflow Missing Authentication on Critical API Endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21445</link><description>Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows.

When parsing a NAVCOM packet, the payload length is calculated using `lexer-&gt;length = (size_t)c - 4` without checking if the input byte `c` is less than 4. This results in an unsigned integer underflow, setting `lexer-&gt;length` to a very large value (near `SIZE_MAX`). The parser then enters a loop attempting to consume this massive number of bytes, causing 100% CPU utilization and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:53:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69284 | In plane.io, a Guest User to a Workspace can still be able to see list of members</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69284</link><description>Plane is an an open-source project management tool.
