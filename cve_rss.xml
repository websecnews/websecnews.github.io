Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 23:48:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29941 | Credential Cloning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29941</link><description>Insecure storage of the ICT MIFARE and DESFire encryption keys in the firmware

If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted
by client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data
may result in a stack-based buffer overflow.  This flaw was introduced
in glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.

This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 19:36:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33600 | nscd: Null pointer crashes after notfound response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33600</link><description>nscd: Null pointer crashes after notfound response

If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) cache fails to add a not-found
netgroup response to the cache, the client request can result in a null
pointer dereference.  This flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the
cache was added to nscd.

This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 19:36:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33601 | nscd: netgroup cache may terminate daemon on memory allocation failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33601</link><description>nscd: netgroup cache may terminate daemon on memory allocation failure

The Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) netgroup cache uses xmalloc or
xrealloc and these functions may terminate the process due to a memory
allocation failure resulting in a denial of service to the clients.  The
flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.

This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 19:36:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33602 | nscd: netgroup cache assumes NSS callback uses in-buffer strings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33602</link><description>nscd: netgroup cache assumes NSS callback uses in-buffer strings

The Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) netgroup cache can corrupt memory
when the NSS callback does not store all strings in the provided buffer.
The flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.

This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 19:36:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33907 | WordPress Print My Blog plugin &amp;lt;= 3.26.2 -

The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32982 | Litestar and Starlite affected by Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (&amp;#x27;Path Traversal&amp;#x27;)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32982</link><description>Litestar and Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.8.3, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability has been discovered in the static file serving component of LiteStar. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit path traversal flaws, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the designated directories. Such access can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or potentially compromise the server. The vulnerability is located in the file path handling mechanism within the static content serving function, specifically at `litestar/static_files/base.py`. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34064 | Jinja vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys to xmlattr filter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34064</link><description>Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `&gt;`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33119 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in
