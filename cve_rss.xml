A bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy` gives ServiceAccount tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name. For example consider two tenants `solar` and `wind`. Tenant `solar`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`. Tenant `wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `wind`. The Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the namespaces of the Tenant `wind` and vice-versa, although this is not correct. The bug introduces an exfiltration vulnerability since allows the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants, although just in some specific conditions: 1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-caching=false` (default value: `false`) and 2. Tenant owners are ServiceAccount, with the same resource name, but in different Namespaces. This vulnerability doesn't allow any privilege escalation on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes RBAC is enforcing this. This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 18:41:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-39345 | Unauthorized Access to Private Fields in User Registration API in strapi</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39345</link><description>strapi is an open-source headless CMS. Versions prior to 4.13.1 did not properly restrict write access to fielded marked as private in the user registration endpoint.

Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings → Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings_):
- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code → [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_. Similarly, individual MyBB forum users are able to disable the visual editor by diabling the account option (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_) _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 17:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44398 | Out-of-bounds write in exiv2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44398</link><description>Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 17:39:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4700 | Improper Access Control in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4700</link><description>An authorization issue affecting GitLab EE affecting all versions from 14.7 prior to 16.3.6, 16.4 prior to 16.4.2, and 16.5 prior to 16.5.1, allowed a user to run jobs in protected environments, bypassing any required approvals.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 17:39:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45827 | Prototype Pollution vulnerability in @clickbar/dot-diver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45827</link><description>Dot diver is a lightweight, powerful, and dependency-free TypeScript utility library that provides types and functions to work with object paths in dot notation.

excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applications
that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this
are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the
"-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:58:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5969 |  Denial of Service via Link Preview in /api/v4/redirect_location</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5969</link><description>Mattermost fails to properly sanitize the request to /api/v4/redirect_location allowing an attacker, sending a specially crafted request to /api/v4/redirect_location, to fill up the memory due to caching large items.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:58:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5968 | Password hash in response body after username update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5968</link><description>Mattermost fails to properly sanitize the user object when updating the username, resulting in the password hash being included in the response body.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:38:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5967 | Denial of Service via crashing the Calls Plugin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5967</link><description>Mattermost fails to properly validate requests to the Calls plugin, allowing an attacker sending a request without a User Agent header to cause a panic and crash the Calls plugin</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:26:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41378 | Calico Typha hangs during unclean TLS handshake</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41378</link><description>In certain conditions for Calico Typha (v3.26.2, v3.25.1 and below), and Calico Enterprise Typha (v3.17.1, v3.16.3, v3.15.3 and below), a client TLS handshake can block the Calico Typha server indefinitely, resulting in denial of service.

This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the "rpcecho" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 07:20:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47253 | Qualitor through 8.20 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via PHP code in the html/ad/adpesquisasql/request/processVariavel.ph...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47253</link><description>Qualitor through 8.20 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via PHP code in the html/ad/adpesquisasql/request/processVariavel.php gridValoresPopHidden parameter.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 05:27:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38406 | bgpd/bgp_flowspec.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.4.3 mishandles an nlri length of zero, aka a "flowspec overflow."</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38406</link><description>bgpd/bgp_flowspec.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.4.3 mishandles an nlri length of zero, aka a "flowspec overflow."</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 05:27:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38407 | bgpd/bgp_label.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.5 attempts to read beyond the end of the stream during labeled unicast parsing.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38407</link><description>bgpd/bgp_label.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.5 attempts to read beyond the end of the stream during labeled unicast parsing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 05:27:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4699 | Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerability in MELSEC Series</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4699</link><description>Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation MELSEC-F Series main modules and MELSEC iQ-F Series CPU modules allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to reset the memory of the products to factory default state and cause denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the products by sending specific packets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 05:27:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4625 | Denial-of-Service（DoS） Vulnerability in Web server function on MELSEC Series CPU module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4625</link><description>Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation MELSEC iQ-F Series CPU modules Web server function allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging into the Web server function for a certain period after the attacker has attempted to log in illegally by continuously attempting unauthorized login to the Web server function.
