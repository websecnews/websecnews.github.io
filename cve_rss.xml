Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 02:45:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-40361 | Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in Elite CRM v1.2.11 allows attacker to execute arbitrary code via the language parameter to the /ngs/log...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-40361</link><description>Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in Elite CRM v1.2.11 allows attacker to execute arbitrary code via the language parameter to the /ngs/login endpoint.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 02:31:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45169 | IBM AIX denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45169</link><description>IBM AIX 7.2, 7.3, and VIOS 3.1 could allow a non-privileged local user to exploit a vulnerability in the pmsvcs kernel extension to cause a denial of service.

An attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of PATH_CHALLENGE frames. The receiver is supposed to respond to each PATH_CHALLENGE frame with a PATH_RESPONSE frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these PATH_RESPONSE frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 0.37.7, 0.38.2 and 0.39.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:49:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21638 | Azure IPAM solution Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21638</link><description>Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:49:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51123 | An issue discovered in D-Link dir815 v.1.01SSb08.bin allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted POST request to the se...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51123</link><description>An issue discovered in D-Link dir815 v.1.01SSb08.bin allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted POST request to the service parameter in the soapcgi_main function of the cgibin binary component.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:39:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0333 | Insufficient data validation in Extensions in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.216 allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0333</link><description>Insufficient data validation in Extensions in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.216 allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to install a malicious extension via a crafted HTML page.

It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:54:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37934 | An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacke...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37934</link><description>An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacker to perform a denial of service attack via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests in a high frequency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44250 | An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a For...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44250</link><description>An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a FortiProxy HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 allows an authenticated attacker to perform elevated actions via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46712 | A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46712</link><description>A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attacker to escalate its privilege via specifically crafted HTTP requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48783 | An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48783</link><description>An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and below, version 6.0.14 and below, version 5.3.8 and below may allow a remote authenticated user with at least read-only permissions to access to other organization endpoints via crafted GET requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37932 | An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37932</link><description>An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0.0 and before 6.4.7 allows an authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the system via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 17:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-29444 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PTC&amp;#x27;s Kepware KEPServerEX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29444</link><description>An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability (DLL hijacking) has been discovered that could allow a locally authenticated adversary to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 16:47:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-36763 | Heap Buffer Overflow in Tcg2MeasureGptTable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36763</link><description>EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasureGptTable() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network.
