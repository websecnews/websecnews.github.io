certificates for Print Deploy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9785</link><description>PaperCut Print Deploy is an optional component that integrates with PaperCut NG/MF which simplifies printer deployment and management. When the component is deployed to an environment, the customer has an option to configure the system to use a self-signed certificate. If the customer does not fully configure the system to leverage the trust database on the clients, it opens up the communication between clients and the server to man-in-the-middle attacks.Â 

It was discovered that certain parts of the documentation related to the configuration of SSL in Print Deploy were lacking, which could potentially contribute to a misconfiguration of the Print Deploy client installation. PaperCut strongly recommends to use valid certificates to secure installations and to follow the updated documentation to ensure the correct SSL configuration. Those who use private CAs and/or self-signed certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority certificate, or their self signed certificate if using only one, to the trust store of their operating system and to the Java key store</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:39:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58176 | Dive&amp;#x27;s improper processing of custom urls can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58176</link><description>Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victimâs machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58351 | Outline&amp;#x27;s Local File Storage Feature can Cause CSP Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58351</link><description>Outline is a service that allows for collaborative documentation. In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:35:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7039 | Glib: buffer under-read on glib through glib/gfileutils.c via get_tmp_file()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7039</link><description>A flaw was found in glib. An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58163 | FreeScout&amp;#x27;s deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58163</link><description>FreeScout is a free help desk and shared inbox built with PHP's Laravel framework. In versions 1.8.185 and below, the application performs deserialization of data that can allow authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited via endpoint: `/help/{mailbox_id}/auth/{customer_id}/{hash}/{timestamp}` where the `customer_id` and `timestamp` parameters are processed through the decrypt function in `app/Helper.php` without proper validation. The vulnerable code performs decryption using Laravel's built-in encryption functions, which subsequently deserializes the decrypted payload without sanitization. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9847 | ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System register.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9847</link><description>A weakness has been identified in ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System 1.0.

Versions 0.2.0 through 0.6.7 stored confidential information, including API keys, in a local SQLite database without encryption. This behavior was not clearly documented outside of the database architecture page. Users were not given the ability to configure the database location, allowing anyone with access to the container or host filesystem to retrieve sensitive data in plaintext by accessing the .db file. This is fixed in version 1.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 01:02:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9843 | Das Parking Management System åè½¦åºç®¡çç³»ç» FindAll information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9843</link><description>A flaw has been found in Das Parking Management System åè½¦åºç®¡çç³»ç» 6.2.0.

Versions 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0 contain a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache, causing abnormal process termination. The vulnerability is in Envoy's Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation, occurring when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions. This condition may occur when the following conditions are met: dynamic Forwarding Filter is enabled, the `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag is enabled, and the Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding Filter and Router filters. This issue is resolved in versions 1.34.5 and 1.35.1. To work around this issue, set the envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts runtime flag to false.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:47:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9841 | code-projects Mobile Shop Management System AddNewProduct.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9841</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in code-projects Mobile Shop Management System 1.0.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to read arbitrary files. If allow_url_include is enabled on the server, remote code execution is possible.
While the vendor patched this issue in version 6.1.0, the patch caused a fatal error in the vulnerable code, due to a missing class import, so we consider 6.1.2 to be the most complete and best patched version</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:28:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9840 | itsourcecode Sports Management System gametype.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9840</link><description>A weakness has been identified in itsourcecode Sports Management System 1.0.
