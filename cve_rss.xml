This vulnerability causes VCenter credentials to be exposed in the ClusterProvision object after provisioning a VSphere cluster. Users with read access to ClusterProvision objects can extract sensitive credentials even if they do not have direct access to Kubernetes Secrets. This issue can lead to unauthorized VCenter access, cluster management, and privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:45:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2385 | code-projects Modern Bag login.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2385</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in code-projects Modern Bag 1.0 and classified as critical.

Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:53:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2381 | PHPGurukul Curfew e-Pass Management System search-pass.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2381</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in PHPGurukul Curfew e-Pass Management System 1.0.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.6.1, 1.7.1, and 2.0.1 allows users to manipulate the final payment amount processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart after initiating the PayPal Express Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount, while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total. This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value. Attackers can intentionally pay less than the actual total order amount, business owners may suffer financial losses due to underpaid orders, and integrity of payment processing is compromised. The issue is fixed in versions 1.6.1, 1.7.1, 2.0.1, and above. To resolve the problem in the end application without updating to the newest patches, there is a need to overwrite `ProcessPayPalOrderAction`, `CompletePayPalOrderFromPaymentPageAction`, and `CaptureAction` with modified logic.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-15706 | An improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the SSL VPN portal of FortiProxy version 2.0.0, version 1.2.9 and below an...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15706</link><description>An improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the SSL VPN portal of FortiProxy version 2.0.0, version 1.2.9 and below and FortiOS version 6.2.1 and below, version 6.0.8 and below, version 5.6.12 may allow a remote authenticated attacker to perform a stored cross site scripting attack (XSS).</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-17659 | A use of hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability in FortiSIEM version 5.2.6 may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain SSH acc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17659</link><description>A use of hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability in FortiSIEM version 5.2.6 may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain SSH access to the supervisor as the restricted user "tunneluser" by leveraging knowledge of the private key from another installation or a firmware image.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-29010 | An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability in FortiOS version 6.2.4 and below, version 6.0.10 and belowmay ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-29010</link><description>An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability in FortiOS version 6.2.4 and below, version 6.0.10 and belowmay allow remote authenticated actors to read the SSL VPN events log entries of users in other VDOMs by  executing "get vpn ssl monitor" from the CLI.

Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2378 | PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System download-medical-cards.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2378</link><description>A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System 1.0.
