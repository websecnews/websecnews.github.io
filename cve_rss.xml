The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that
takes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that "an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of
the base file". However, when the path contains encoded ".."
characters (for example, "%2E%2E/bar.txt"), it might return file objects that are not
a descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.
This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:25:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2691 | Versions of the package nossrf before 1.0.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker can provide a hostname th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2691</link><description>Versions of the package nossrf before 1.0.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker can provide a hostname that resolves to a local or reserved IP address space and bypass the SSRF protection mechanism.</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30474 | Apache Commons VFS: Failing to find an FTP file can reveal the URI&amp;#x27;s password in an error message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30474</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS.
