Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the 
developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed
 macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro 
is executed.

Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.


This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4607 | Mali GPU Kernel Driver allows improper GPU memory processing operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4607</link><description>Use After Free vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU memory processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0; Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 11:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2937 | Mali GPU Kernel Driver allows improper GPU memory processing operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2937</link><description>Use After Free vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU memory processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0; Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r49p0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 11:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40096 | The com.cascadialabs.who (aka Who - Caller ID, Spam Block) application 15.0 for Android places sensitive information in the system log.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40096</link><description>The com.cascadialabs.who (aka Who - Caller ID, Spam Block) application 15.0 for Android places sensitive information in the system log.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 10:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36448 | Apache IoTDB Workbench: SSRF Vulnerability (EOL)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36448</link><description>** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache IoTDB Workbench.

This issue affects Apache IoTDB Workbench: from 0.13.0.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 10:03:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38856 | Apache OFBiz: Unauthenticated endpoint could allow execution of screen rendering code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38856</link><description>Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache OFBiz.

This issue affects Apache OFBiz: through 18.12.14.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 18.12.15, which fixes the issue.

Unauthenticated endpoints could allow execution of screen rendering code of screens if some preconditions are met (such as when the screen definitions don't explicitly check user's permissions because they rely on the configuration of their endpoints).</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 08:38:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42447 | Apache Airflow Providers FAB: FAB provider 1.2.1 and 1.2.0 did not let user to logout for Airflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42447</link><description>Insufficient Session Expiration vulnerability in Apache Airflow Providers FAB.

This issue affects Apache Airflow Providers FAB: 1.2.1 (when used with Apache Airflow 2.9.3) and FAB 1.2.0 for all Airflow versions. The FAB provider prevented the user from logging out.  

* FAB provider 1.2.1 only affected Airflow 2.9.3 (earlier and later versions of Airflow are not affected)

* FAB provider 1.2.0 affected all versions of Airflow.

Users who run Apache Airflow 2.9.3 are recommended to upgrade to Apache Airflow Providers FAB version 1.2.2 which fixes the issue.

Users who run Any Apache Airflow version and have FAB provider 1.2.0 are recommended to upgrade to Apache Airflow Providers FAB version 1.2.2 which fixes the issue.

Also upgrading Apache Airflow to latest version available is recommended.

Note: Early version of Airflow reference container images of Airflow 2.9.3 and constraint files contained FAB provider 1.2.1 version, but this is fixed in updated versions of the images.
