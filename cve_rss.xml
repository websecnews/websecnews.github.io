thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug

With the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code,
user space can open the "mitigations" file for a thermal zone before
the zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer
dereference in tze_seq_start().

Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal
zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing
the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may clear
tz-&gt;debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the
struct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.

To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's
struct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in
thermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(),
tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s-&gt;private
instead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensure
that tz_debugfs will be valid across the "mitigations" file accesses
until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove()
removes that file.

To address the second problem, use tz-&gt;lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove()
around the tz-&gt;debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is
removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

net: ks8851: Queue RX packets in IRQ handler instead of disabling BHs

Currently the driver uses local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() in its
IRQ handler to avoid triggering net_rx_action() softirq on exit from
netif_rx(). The net_rx_action() could trigger this driver .start_xmit
callback, which is protected by the same lock as the IRQ handler, so
calling the .start_xmit from netif_rx() from the IRQ handler critical
section protected by the lock could lead to an attempt to claim the
already claimed lock, and a hang.

The local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() approach works only in case
the IRQ handler is protected by a spinlock, but does not work if the
IRQ handler is protected by mutex, i.e. this works for KS8851 with
Parallel bus interface, but not for KS8851 with SPI bus interface.

Remove the BH manipulation and instead of calling netif_rx() inside
the IRQ handler code protected by the lock, queue all the received
SKBs in the IRQ handler into a queue first, and once the IRQ handler
exits the critical section protected by the lock, dequeue all the
queued SKBs and push them all into netif_rx(). At this point, it is
safe to trigger the net_rx_action() softirq, since the netif_rx()
call is outside of the lock that protects the IRQ handler.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:52:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36963 | tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36963</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options

There's an inconsistency with the way permissions are handled in tracefs.
Because the permissions are generated when accessed, they default to the
root inode's permission if they were never set by the user. If the user
sets the permissions, then a flag is set and the permissions are saved via
the inode (for tracefs files) or an internal attribute field (for
eventfs).

But if a remount happens that specify the permissions, all the files that
were not changed by the user gets updated, but the ones that were are not.
If the user were to remount the file system with a given permission, then
all files and directories within that file system should be updated.

This can cause security issues if a file's permission was updated but the
admin forgot about it. They could incorrectly think that remounting with
permissions set would update all files, but miss some.

For example:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # chgrp 1002 current_tracer
 # ls -l
[..]
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp  0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Where current_tracer now has group "lkp".

 # mount -o remount,gid=1001 .
 # ls -l
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp     0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Everything changed but the "current_tracer".

Add a new link list that keeps track of all the tracefs_inodes which has
the permission flags that tell if the file/dir should use the root inode's
permission or not. Then on remount, clear all the flags so that the
default behavior of using the root inode's permission is done for all
files and directories.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36964 | fs/9p: only translate RWX permissions for plain 9P2000</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36964</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/9p: only translate RWX permissions for plain 9P2000

Garbage in plain 9P2000's perm bits is allowed through, which causes it
to be able to set (among others) the suid bit. This was presumably not
the intent since the unix extended bits are handled explicitly and
conditionally on .u.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35640 | WordPress Safety Exit plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35640</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Tomas Cordero Safety Exit allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Safety Exit: from n/a through 1.7.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:22:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35641 | WordPress Just Writing Statistics plugin &amp;lt;= 4.5 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35641</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in GregRoss Just Writing Statistics allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Just Writing Statistics: from n/a through 4.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:07:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35642 | WordPress Site Favicon plugin &amp;lt;= 0.2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35642</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Bryan Hadaway Site Favicon allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Site Favicon: from n/a through 0.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 06:51:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35643 | WordPress WP Back Button plugin &amp;lt;= 1.1.3 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35643</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Xabier Miranda WP Back Button allows Stored XSS.This issue affects WP Back Button: from n/a through 1.1.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 06:51:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5311 | DigiWin EasyFlow .NET - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5311</link><description>DigiWin EasyFlow .NET lacks validation for certain input parameters.
