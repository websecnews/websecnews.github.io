In versions 2.52.8 and below, when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., test.18446744073704), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash.

In versions 3.1.5 through 4.2.24, 4.3.0 through 4.3.11 and 4.4.0 through 4.4.3, Mastodon's rate-limiting system has a critical configuration error where the email-based throttle for confirmation emails incorrectly checks the password reset path instead of the confirmation path, effectively disabling per-email limits for confirmation requests. This allows attackers to bypass rate limits by rotating IP addresses and send unlimited confirmation emails to any email address, as only a weak IP-based throttle (25 requests per 5 minutes) remains active. The vulnerability enables denial-of-service attacks that can overwhelm mail queues and facilitate user harassment through confirmation email spam.

In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui &lt;= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (&lt;&lt;) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy.

In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling loops that could hang the thread.

These conditions enable attackers to upload executable payloads and .mof files to locations such as system32 and wbem\mof, where Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) automatically processes and executes them. This results in remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges, without requiring user interaction.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:11:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10032 | Maxthon3 about:history XCS Trusted Zone Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10032</link><description>Maxthon3 versions prior to 3.3 are vulnerable to cross context scripting (XCS) via the about:history page. The browser’s trusted zone improperly handles injected script content, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a privileged context. This flaw enables modification of browser configuration and execution of arbitrary code through Maxthon’s exposed DOM APIs, including maxthon.program.Program.launch() and maxthon.io.writeDataURL(). Exploitation requires user interaction, typically by visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the injection.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:11:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10033 | Narcissus backend.php Image Configuration Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10033</link><description>Narcissus is vulnerable to remote code execution via improper input handling in its image configuration workflow. Specifically, the backend.php script fails to sanitize the release parameter before passing it to the configure_image() function. This function invokes PHP’s passthru() with the unsanitized input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary system commands. Exploitation occurs via a crafted POST request, resulting in command execution under the web server’s context.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:11:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10035 | Turbo FTP Server 1.30.823/826 PORT Command Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10035</link><description>Turbo FTP Server versions 1.30.823 and 1.30.826 contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of the PORT command.

A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a request that injects arbitrary PHP code, resulting in command execution under the web server's context. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute system-level commands via base64-encoded payloads embedded in parameter names, leading to full compromise of the host system.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10031 | BlazeVideo HDTV Player Pro 6.6.0.3 Filename Handling Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10031</link><description>BlazeVideo HDTV Player Pro v6.6.0.3 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of user-supplied input embedded in .plf playlist files. When parsing a crafted .plf file, the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component invokes PathFindFileNameA() to extract a filename from a URL-like string. The returned value is then copied to a fixed-size stack buffer using an inline strcpy call without bounds checking. If the input exceeds the buffer size, this leads to a stack overflow and potential arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10034 | ClanSphere 2011.3 Local File Inclusion via cs_lang Cookie</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10034</link><description>ClanSphere 2011.3 is vulnerable to a local file inclusion (LFI) flaw due to improper handling of the cs_lang cookie parameter.

This is fixed in version 9.1.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 01:46:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53544 | Trilium Notes is Vulnerable to Brute-force Protection Bypass via Initial Sync Seed Retrieval</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53544</link><description>Trilium Notes is an open-source, cross-platform hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases. In versions below 0.97.0, a brute-force protection bypass in the initial sync seed retrieval endpoint allows unauthenticated attackers to guess the login password without triggering rate limiting. Trilium is a single-user app without a username requirement, and brute-force protection bypass makes exploitation much more feasible. Multiple features provided by Trilium (e.g. MFA, share notes, custom request handler) indicate that Trilium can be exposed to the internet. This is fixed in version 0.97.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 01:46:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54119 | ADOdb&amp;#x27;s sqlite3 driver allows SQL injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54119</link><description>ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases.
