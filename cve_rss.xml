When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was just opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes the window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument list that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it will crash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 23:59:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43378 | calamares-nixos-extensions LUKS keyfile exposure regression on legacy BIOS systems</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43378</link><description>calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI; some disk partitions are encrypted; but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted; have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 20:06:59 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 09:00:20 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it applied to the default configuration on BIOS systems.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 23:59:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43370 | gettext.js vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43370</link><description>gettext.js is a GNU gettext port for node and the browser.

In versions on the 4.6 branch prior to 4.6.10, the validator for the RichText fieldtype blocklists `javascript:` and `vbscript:` in links to prevent XSS. This can leave other options open, and the check can be circumvented using upper case. Content editing permissions for RichText content is required to exploit this vulnerability, which typically means Editor role or higher. The fix implements an allowlist instead, which allows only approved link protocols. The new check is case insensitive. Version 4.6.10 contains a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 23:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7844 | SourceCodester Online Graduate Tracer System add_acc.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7844</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester Online Graduate Tracer System 1.0 and classified as problematic.

Starting in version 0.16 and prior to version 0.19.0, a wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts. Boa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`. However, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user. Version 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case. Users unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 20:50:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42488 | Cilium agent&amp;#x27;s race condition may lead to policy bypass for Host Firewall policy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42488</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

When this project is compiled with certain compiler flags set, it is possible that the `state` parameter will not be checked at all, creating a CSRF vulnerability.

Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.

When `persistent=subdir` is used in the application permissions (represented as `--persist=subdir` in the command-line interface), that means that an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as `~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir`. This allows existing apps that are not aware of the per-application directory to still work as intended without general home directory access.

However, the application does have write access to the application directory `~/.var/app/$APPID` where this directory is stored. If the source directory for the `persistent`/`--persist` option is replaced by a symlink, then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.

Partial protection against this vulnerability can be provided by patching Flatpak using the patches in commits ceec2ffc and 98f79773. However, this leaves a race condition that could be exploited by two instances of a malicious app running in parallel. Closing the race condition requires updating or patching the version of bubblewrap that is used by Flatpak to add the new `--bind-fd` option using the patch and then patching Flatpak to use it. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.15.x) or `--with-system-bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.14.x or older), or a similar option, then the version of bubblewrap that needs to be patched is a system copy that is distributed separately, typically `/usr/bin/bwrap`. This configuration is the one that is typically used in Linux distributions. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=` (1.15.x) or with `--without-system-bubblewrap` (1.14.x or older), then it is the bundled version of bubblewrap that is included with Flatpak that must be patched. This is typically installed as `/usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap`. This configuration is the default when building from source code.

For the 1.14.x stable branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.14.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap included in this release has been updated to 0.6.3. For the 1.15.x development branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.15.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap in this release is a Meson "wrap" subproject, which has been updated to 0.10.0. The 1.12.x and 1.10.x branches will not be updated for this vulnerability. Long-term support OS distributions should backport the individual changes into their versions of Flatpak and bubblewrap, or update to newer versions if their stability policy allows it. As a workaround, avoid using applications using the `persistent` (`--persist`) permission.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:40:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43357 | JavaScript specification issue may lead to type confusion and pointer dereference in implementations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43357</link><description>ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor, may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as type confusion and pointer dereference.

The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.

The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.

In an eLabFTW system, one might disallow user creation except for by system administrators, administrators and trusted services. If administrators are allowed to create new users (which is the default), the vulnerability allows any user to create new users in teams where they are members. The new users are automatically validated and administrators are not notified. This can allow a user with permanent or temporary access to a user account or API key to maintain persistence in an eLabFTW system. Additionally, it allows the user to create separate account under a different name, and produce misleading revision histories. No additional privileges are granted to the new user. Users should upgrade to version 5.0.0 to receive a patch. As a workaround, disabling both options that allow *administrators* to create users will provide a mitigation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:40:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27728 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Friendica v.2023.12 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the text parameter of...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27728</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Friendica v.2023.12 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the text parameter of the babel debug feature.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:40:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42757 | Command injection vulnerability in Asus RT-N15U 3.0.0.4.376_3754 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the netstat function...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42757</link><description>Command injection vulnerability in Asus RT-N15U 3.0.0.4.376_3754 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the netstat function page.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:40:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23168 | Vulnerability in Xiexe XSOverlay before build 647 allows non-local websites to send the malicious commands to the WebSocket API, resulting i...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23168</link><description>Vulnerability in Xiexe XSOverlay before build 647 allows non-local websites to send the malicious commands to the WebSocket API, resulting in the arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:24:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32231 | Stash up to v0.25.1 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the sort parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32231</link><description>Stash up to v0.25.1 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the sort parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22217 | A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Terminalfour before 8.3.19 allows authenticated users to use specific features to acce...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22217</link><description>A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Terminalfour before 8.3.19 allows authenticated users to use specific features to access internal services including sensitive information on the server that Terminalfour runs on.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22219 | XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Terminalfour 8.0.0001 through 8.3.18 and XML JDBC versions up to 1.0.4 allows authenticated users...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22219</link><description>XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Terminalfour 8.0.0001 through 8.3.18 and XML JDBC versions up to 1.0.4 allows authenticated users to submit malicious XML via unspecified features which could lead to various actions such as accessing the underlying server, remote code execution (RCE), or performing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:47:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22218 | XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Terminalfour 8.0.0001 through 8.3.18 and XML JDBC versions up to 1.0.4 allows authenticated users...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22218</link><description>XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Terminalfour 8.0.0001 through 8.3.18 and XML JDBC versions up to 1.0.4 allows authenticated users to submit malicious XML via unspecified features which could lead to various actions such as accessing the underlying server, remote code execution (RCE), or performing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:47:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31905 | IBM QRadar Network Packet Capture information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31905</link><description>IBM QRadar Network Packet Capture 7.5 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security.

An arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in the webcrack module when processing specifically crafted malicious code on Windows systems. This vulnerability is triggered when using the unpack bundles feature in conjunction with the saving feature. If a module name includes a path traversal sequence with Windows path separators, an attacker can exploit this to overwrite files on the host system. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary `.js` files to the host system, which can be leveraged to hijack legitimate Node.js modules to gain arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.14.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:39:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6347 | Unauthorized access to ECU functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6347</link><description>*  Unprotected privileged mode access through UDS session in the Blind Spot Detection Sensor ECU firmware in Nissan Altima (2022) allows attackers to trigger denial-of-service (DoS) by unauthorized access to the ECU's programming session.

This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix put in place for GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99. In pull request 1149, sanitation was added for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`. An attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. This vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 21:27:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7793 | SourceCodester Task Progress Tracker add-task.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7793</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Task Progress Tracker 1.0.

drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation

Calculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value
between the requested size and the actual size does not consider
the partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.

Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the
total size is now deduced from the difference between the end and
start addresses.

Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer
and more understandable form.
