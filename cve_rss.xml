This is due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated booking processing endpoint (cpabc_appointments_check_IPN_verification) that trusts attacker-supplied payment notifications without verifying their origin, authenticity, or requiring proper authorization checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily confirm bookings and insert them into the live calendar via the 'cpabc_ipncheck' parameter, triggering administrative and customer notification emails and disrupting operations.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 07:39:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13384 | CP Contact Form with PayPal &amp;lt;= 1.3.56 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Payment Confirmation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13384</link><description>The CP Contact Form with PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.56.
