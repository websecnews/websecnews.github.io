The absence of encryption and authentication mechanisms in the communication protocol allows an attacker to capture legitimate traffic between the robot and the controller, replicate it, and send any valid command to the robot from any attacking computer or device. The communication protocol used in this interface is based on MAVLink, a widely documented protocol, which increases the likelihood of attack. There are two methods for connecting to the robot remotely: Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41109 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability in Ghost Robotics&amp;#x27; Vision 60</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41109</link><description>Ghost Robotics Vision 60 v0.27.2 includes, among its physical interfaces, three RJ45 connectors and a USB Type-C port.

In Mastodon version 4.4, support for verifiable quote posts with quote controls was added, but it is possible for an attacker to bypass these controls in Mastodon versions prior to 4.4.8 and 4.5.0-beta.2. Mastodon internally treats reblogs as statuses. Since they were not special-treated, an attacker could reblog any post, then quote their reblog, technically quoting themselves, but having the quote feature a preview of the post they did not get authorization for with all of the affordances that would be otherwise denied by the quote controls. This issue has been patched in versions 4.4.8 and 4.5.0-beta.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62763 | Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) before 10.1.12 allows SSRF because of the configuration of the chat proxy.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62763</link><description>Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) before 10.1.12 allows SSRF because of the configuration of the chat proxy.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62597 | WeGIA Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Endpoint &amp;#x27;pessoa/editar_info_pessoal.php&amp;#x27; Parameter &amp;#x27;sql&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62597</link><description>WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users.

Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.6.

In versions 2.16.2 to before 2.16.3 and 3.0.1 to before 3.0.3, a bypass to CVE-2025-8129 was discovered in the Koa.js framework affecting its back redirect functionality. In certain circumstances, an attacker can manipulate the Referer header to force a user’s browser to navigate to an external, potentially malicious website. This occurs because the implementation incorrectly treats some specially crafted URLs as safe relative paths. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow attackers to perform phishing, social engineering, or other redirect-based attacks on users of affected applications. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22166 | This High severity DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability was introduced in version 2.0 of Confluence Data Center.&#13;

This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding, allowing attacker-controlled input to be rendered directly in the browser. When exploited, an attacker can steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website. This can lead to user data compromise, loss of user trust, and a broader attack surface for more advanced exploitation techniques.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:00:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62250 | Improper Authentication in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 thro...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62250</link><description>Improper Authentication in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4, 7.4 GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions allows remote attackers to send malicious data to the Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4, 7.4 GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions that will treat it as trusted data via unauthenticated cluster messages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61220 | The incomplete verification mechanism in the AutoBizLine com.mysecondline.app 1.2.91 allows attackers to log in as other users and gain unau...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61220</link><description>The incomplete verification mechanism in the AutoBizLine com.mysecondline.app 1.2.91 allows attackers to log in as other users and gain unauthorized access to their personal information.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61181 | daicuocms V1.3.13 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the image upload feature.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61181</link><description>daicuocms V1.3.13 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the image upload feature.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:41:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60751 | GeographicLib 2.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in GeoConvert DMS::InternalDecode.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60751</link><description>GeographicLib 2.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in GeoConvert DMS::InternalDecode.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61194 | daicuocms V1.3.13 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the file library\think\db\Builder.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61194</link><description>daicuocms V1.3.13 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the file library\think\db\Builder.php.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:27:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36855 | DCMTK dcmqrscp parseQuota stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36855</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in DCMTK up to 3.6.5.

The application loads a network plugin without validating its digital signature or verifying its authenticity. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by placing a malicious component in the expected location, which is controllable by the attacker (e.g., under %APPDATA%), resulting in code execution within the context of the user. The main application is digitally signed, which may allow a malicious component to inherit trust and evade detection by security solutions that rely on signed parent processes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:02:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60932 | Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Current Goals function of HR Performance Solutions Performance Pro v3.19.1...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60932</link><description>Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Current Goals function of HR Performance Solutions Performance Pro v3.19.17 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Goal Name, Goal Notes, Action Step Name, Action Step Description, Note Name, and Goal Description parameters.

The WorkExaminer Professional console is used for administrative access to the server. Before access to the console is granted administrators must login. Internally, a custom protocol is used to call a respective stored procedure on the MSSQL database. The return value of the call is not validated on the server-side. Instead it is only validated client-side which allows to bypass authentication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9428 | SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9428</link><description>Zohocorp ManageEngine Analytics Plus versions 6171 and prior are vulnerable to authenticated SQL Injection via the key update api.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10639 | Usage of Hardcoded FTP Credentials EfficientLab WorkExaminer Professional</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10639</link><description>The WorkExaminer Professional server installation comes with an FTP server that is used to receive the client logs on TCP port 12304. An attacker with network access to this port can use weak hardcoded credentials to login to the FTP server and modify or read data, log files and gain remote code execution as NT Authority\SYSTEM on the server by exchanging accessible service binaries in the WorkExaminer installation directory (e.g. "C:\Program File (x86)\Work Examiner Professional Server").</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:42:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7473 | XML Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7473</link><description>Zohocorp ManageEngine EndPoint Central versions 11.4.2516.1 and prior are vulnerable to XML Injection.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:22:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5496 | Arbitrary File Deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5496</link><description>ZohoCorp ManageEngine Endpoint Central versions earlier than 11.4.2508.14, 11.4.2516.06, and 11.4.2518.01 are affected by an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the agent setup component.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10612 | XSS in GiSoft&amp;#x27;s City Guide</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10612</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in giSoft Information Technologies City Guide allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects City Guide: before 1.4.45.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 08:57:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26392 | SolarWinds Observability Self-Hosted SQL Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26392</link><description>SolarWinds Observability Self-Hosted is susceptible to SQL injection vulnerability that may display sensitive data using a low-level account.

Prior to version 1.4.0, a business logic flaw in FileRise’s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g., a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side, avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames, and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 17:43:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62510 | FileRise insecure folder visibility via name-based mapping and incomplete ACL checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62510</link><description>FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations.

mm/hugetlb: fix folio is still mapped when deleted

Migration may be raced with fallocating hole.  remove_inode_single_folio
will unmap the folio if the folio is still mapped.  However, it's called
without folio lock.  If the folio is migrated and the mapped pte has been
converted to migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false, and won't
unmap it.  Due to extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio,
migration fails, restores migration entry to normal pte, and the folio is
mapped again.  As a result, we triggered BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.

The log is as follows:

netfs: fix reference leak

Commit 20d72b00ca81 ("netfs: Fix the request's work item to not
require a ref") modified netfs_alloc_request() to initialize the
reference counter to 2 instead of 1.  The rationale was that the
requet's "work" would release the second reference after completion
(via netfs_{read,write}_collection_worker()).  That works most of the
time if all goes well.

However, it leaks this additional reference if the request is released
before the I/O operation has been submitted: the error code path only
decrements the reference counter once and the work item will never be
queued because there will never be a completion.

This has caused outages of our whole server cluster today because
tasks were blocked in netfs_wait_for_outstanding_io(), leading to
deadlocks in Ceph (another bug that I will address soon in another
patch).  This was caused by a netfs_pgpriv2_begin_copy_to_cache() call
which failed in fscache_begin_write_operation().  The leaked
netfs_io_request was never completed, leaving `netfs_inode.io_count`
with a positive value forever.

All of this is super-fragile code.  Finding out which code paths will
lead to an eventual completion and which do not is hard to see:

- Some functions like netfs_create_write_req() allocate a request, but
  will never submit any I/O.

- netfs_unbuffered_read_iter_locked() calls netfs_unbuffered_read()
  and then netfs_put_request(); however, netfs_unbuffered_read() can
  also fail early before submitting the I/O request, therefore another
  netfs_put_request() call must be added there.

A rule of thumb is that functions that return a `netfs_io_request` do
not submit I/O, and all of their callers must be checked.

For my taste, the whole netfs code needs an overhaul to make reference
counting easier to understand and less fragile &amp; obscure.  But to fix
this bug here and now and produce a patch that is adequate for a
stable backport, I tried a minimal approach that quickly frees the
request object upon early failure.

I decided against adding a second netfs_put_request() each time
because that would cause code duplication which obscures the code
further.  Instead, I added the function netfs_put_failed_request()
which frees such a failed request synchronously under the assumption
that the reference count is exactly 2 (as initially set by
netfs_alloc_request() and never touched), verified by a
WARN_ON_ONCE().  It then deinitializes the request object (without
going through the "cleanup_work" indirection) and frees the allocation
(with RCU protection to protect against concurrent access by
netfs_requests_seq_start()).

All code paths that fail early have been changed to call
netfs_put_failed_request() instead of netfs_put_request().
Additionally, I have added a netfs_put_request() call to
netfs_unbuffered_read() as explained above because the
netfs_put_failed_request() approach does not work there.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40008 | kmsan: fix out-of-bounds access to shadow memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This occurs when memset() is called on a buffer that is not 4-byte aligned
and extends to the end of a guard page, i.e.  the next page is unmapped.

The bug is that the loop at the end of kmsan_internal_set_shadow_origin()
accesses the wrong shadow memory bytes when the address is not 4-byte
aligned.  Since each 4 bytes are associated with an origin, it rounds the
address and size so that it can access all the origins that contain the
buffer.  However, when it checks the corresponding shadow bytes for a
particular origin, it incorrectly uses the original unrounded shadow
address.  This results in reads from shadow memory beyond the end of the
buffer's shadow memory, which crashes when that memory is not mapped.

To fix this, correctly align the shadow address before accessing the 4
shadow bytes corresponding to each origin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40009 | fs/proc/task_mmu: check p-&amp;gt;vec_buf for NULL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40009</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vec_len = 0 in pagemap_scan_init_bounce_buffer() means no buffers are
allocated and p-&gt;vec_buf remains set to NULL.

This breaks an assumption made later in pagemap_scan_backout_range(), that
page_region is always allocated for p-&gt;vec_buf_index.

Fix it by explicitly checking p-&gt;vec_buf for NULL before dereferencing.

Other sites that might run into same deref-issue are already (directly or
transitively) protected by checking p-&gt;vec_buf.

Note:
From PAGEMAP_SCAN man page, it seems vec_len = 0 is valid when no output
is requested and it's only the side effects caller is interested in,
hence it passes check in pagemap_scan_get_args().

net/smc: fix warning in smc_rx_splice() when calling get_page()

smc_lo_register_dmb() allocates DMB buffers with kzalloc(), which are
later passed to get_page() in smc_rx_splice(). Since kmalloc memory is
not page-backed, this triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() in get_page() and prevents
holding a refcount on the buffer. This can lead to use-after-free if
the memory is released before splice_to_pipe() completes.

Use folio_alloc() instead, ensuring DMBs are page-backed and safe for
get_page().

media: uvcvideo: Mark invalid entities with id UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID

Per UVC 1.1+ specification 3.7.2, units and terminals must have a non-zero
unique ID.

```
Each Unit and Terminal within the video function is assigned a unique
identification number, the Unit ID (UID) or Terminal ID (TID), contained in
the bUnitID or bTerminalID field of the descriptor. The value 0x00 is
reserved for undefined ID,
```

If we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked
as UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.

In a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb ("media: uvcvideo: Require
entities to have a non-zero unique ID"), we ignored all the invalid units,
this broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky
this time.

This also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due
to a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an
Output Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But
when looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is
found instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.

In another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID
was 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.

Here is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.

A crash of the DD+ decoder process can occur when a malformed DD+ bitstream is processed. When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57738 | Apache Syncope: Remote Code Execution by delegated administrators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57738</link><description>Apache Syncope offers the ability to extend / customize the base behavior on every deployment by allowing to provide custom implementations of a few Java interfaces; such implementations can be provided either as Java or Groovy classes, with the latter being particularly attractive as the machinery is set for runtime reload.
Such a feature has been available for a while, but recently it was discovered that a malicious administrator can inject Groovy code that can be executed remotely by a running Apache Syncope Core instance.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.14 / 4.0.2, which fix this issue by forcing the Groovy code to run in a sandbox.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 14:48:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61456 | A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bhabishya-123 E-commerce 1.0, specifically within the index endpoint.

net/9p: Fix buffer overflow in USB transport layer

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the USB 9pfs transport layer
where inconsistent size validation between packet header parsing and
actual data copying allows a malicious USB host to overflow heap buffers.

The issue occurs because:
- usb9pfs_rx_header() validates only the declared size in packet header
- usb9pfs_rx_complete() uses req-&gt;actual (actual received bytes) for
memcpy

This allows an attacker to craft packets with small declared size
(bypassing validation) but large actual payload (triggering overflow
in memcpy).

Add validation in usb9pfs_rx_complete() to ensure req-&gt;actual does not
exceed the buffer capacity before copying data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 05:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11948 | Excellent Infotek｜Document Management System - Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11948</link><description>Document Management System developed by Excellent Infotek has an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to upload and execute web shell backdoors, thereby enabling arbitrary code execution on the server.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 03:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
