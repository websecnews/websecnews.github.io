OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1803 | EmbedPress – Embed PDF, Google Docs, Vimeo, Wistia, Embed YouTube Videos, Audios, Maps &amp;amp; Embed Any Documents in Gutenberg &amp;amp; Elementor &amp;lt;= 3.9.12 - Insufficient Authorization Checks to Block Usual</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1803</link><description>The EmbedPress – Embed PDF, Google Docs, Vimeo, Wistia, Embed YouTube Videos, Audios, Maps &amp; Embed Any Documents in Gutenberg &amp; Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to insufficient authorization validation on the PDF embed block in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.12.

On Windows, fetching refs that clash with legacy device names reads from the devices, and checking out paths that clash with such names writes arbitrary data to the devices. This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances. If Windows is not used, or untrusted repositories are not cloned or otherwise used, then there is no impact. A minor degradation in availability may also be possible, such as with a very large file named `CON`, though the user could interrupt the application.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 12:44:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34060 | Arbitrary File Write in IRIS EVTX Pipeline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34060</link><description>IrisEVTXModule is an interface module for Evtx2Splunk and Iris in order to ingest Microsoft EVTX log files.

Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

Fix this warning by using a larger space for adapter-&gt;fw_version,
and then fall back and continue to use snprintf.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 11:50:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5194 | Arris VAP2500 assoc_table.php command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5194</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Arris VAP2500 08.50.

comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows

The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.

Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
zero wMaxPacketSize.

Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.

The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 08:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47476 | comedi: ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command paths</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47476</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: batman-adv: fix error handling

Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was
in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().

Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case
of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when
there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are
initialized; but there isn't any.

All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide
ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv-&gt;nc.work, syzbot was able to hit
GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]

To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.
It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling
path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded
batadv_*_free() functions.

So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory
before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()
and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching
uninitialized fields.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 08:30:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47483 | regmap: Fix possible double-free in regcache_rbtree_exit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47483</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because that since the commit 2b0d3d3e4fcf ("percpu_ref: reduce
memory footprint of percpu_ref in fast path") root_cgrp-&gt;bpf.refcnt.data
is allocated by the function percpu_ref_init in cgroup_bpf_inherit which
is called by cgroup_setup_root when mounting, but not freed along with
root_cgrp when umounting. Adding cgroup_bpf_offline which calls
percpu_ref_kill to cgroup_kill_sb can free root_cgrp-&gt;bpf.refcnt.data in
umount path.

This patch also fixes the commit 4bfc0bb2c60e ("bpf: decouple the lifetime
of cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself"). A cgroup_bpf_offline is needed to do a
cleanup that frees the resources which are allocated by cgroup_bpf_inherit
in cgroup_setup_root.

And inside cgroup_bpf_offline, cgroup_get() is at the beginning and
cgroup_put is at the end of cgroup_bpf_release which is called by
cgroup_bpf_offline. So cgroup_bpf_offline can keep the balance of
cgroup's refcount.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 08:30:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47489 | drm/amdgpu: Fix even more out of bound writes from debugfs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47489</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened
readonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLB
misses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types
so a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block
device, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This
may cause bugs, like [1] and [2].

This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for
regular files in order to close the attack surface.

mm, thp: bail out early in collapse_file for writeback page

Currently collapse_file does not explicitly check PG_writeback, instead,
page_has_private and try_to_release_page are used to filter writeback
pages.  This does not work for xfs with blocksize equal to or larger
than pagesize, because in such case xfs has no page-&gt;private.

cfg80211: fix management registrations locking

The management registrations locking was broken, the list was
locked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update()
iterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causing
list corruption.

Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, just
move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each
wdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so
there's no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially
fixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now
will hold the lock that protects all lists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 08:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47495 | usbnet: sanity check for maxpacket</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47495</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tls: Fix flipped sign in tls_err_abort() calls

sk-&gt;sk_err appears to expect a positive value, a convention that ktls
doesn't always follow and that leads to memory corruption in other code.
For instance,

    [kworker]
    tls_encrypt_done(..., err=)
      tls_err_abort(.., err)
        sk-&gt;sk_err = err;

    [task]

      ...
        tls_sw_do_sendpage
          if (sk-&gt;sk_err) {
            ret = -sk-&gt;sk_err;  // ret is positive

    splice_from_pipe_feed (continued)
      ret = actor(...)  // ret is still positive and interpreted as bytes
                        // written, resulting in underflow of buf-&gt;len and
                        // sd-&gt;len, leading to huge buf-&gt;offset and bogus
                        // addresses computed in later calls to actor()

Fix all tls_err_abort() callers to pass a negative error code
consistently and centralize the error-prone sign flip there, throwing in
a warning to catch future misuse and uninlining the function so it
really does only warn once.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 08:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47497 | nvmem: Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cells</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47497</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If a cell has 'nbits' equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic

 *p &amp;= GENMASK((cell-&gt;nbits%BITS_PER_BYTE) - 1, 0);

will become undefined behavior because nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, and we
subtract one from that making a large number that is then shifted more than the
number of bits that fit into an unsigned long.

switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during
suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.

Error injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with a

occurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.

The only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=
-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However the

xhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command

The command ring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command
ring control register (CRCR). All the control bits like command stop,
abort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read the
CRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will always
give command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write only
the control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit writes,
there is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper
dword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the upper

Fix this by:
1) Establishing pointers to 'struct dm_io' members in
dm_io_dec_pending() so that they may be passed into end_io_acct()
_after_ free_io() is called.
2) Moving end_io_acct() after free_io().</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47436 | usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47436</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error path

Commit 7c75bde329d7 ("usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() after
initializing musb") has inverted the calls to
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() and dsps_create_musb_pdev() without
updating correctly the error path. dsps_create_musb_pdev() allocates and
registers a new platform device which must be unregistered and freed
with platform_device_unregister(), and this is missing upon
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() error.

While on the master branch it seems not to trigger any issue, I observed
a kernel crash because of a NULL pointer dereference with a v5.10.70
stable kernel where the patch mentioned above was backported. With this
kernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to
error out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on
the Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the
system is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the
boot phase triggers the crash.

My limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit
which was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,
does not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to
fire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot
ever happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the
-&gt;enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform
device must be already registered in order for the core or any other
user to use this callback.

Hence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future
errors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47437 | iio: adis16475: fix deadlock on frequency set</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47437</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix memory leak in mlx5_core_destroy_cq() error path

Prior to this patch in case mlx5_core_destroy_cq() failed it returns
without completing all destroy operations and that leads to memory leak.
Instead, complete the destroy flow before return error.

Also move mlx5_debug_cq_remove() to the beginning of mlx5_core_destroy_cq()
to be symmetrical with mlx5_core_create_cq().

net: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work

When the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes
with null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove
function tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using
cancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.

During dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn
reschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.
Due to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access
dp-&gt;slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove
function. Hence kernel crashes.

To avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the
mib_interval to 0.

mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, mlxsw allows cooling states to be set above the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver:

 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type
 mlxsw_fan
 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state
 10
 # echo 18 &gt; /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state
 # echo $?
 0

This results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state
transition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the
transition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].

According to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the
driver to reject such operations [2].

Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver.

To avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],
partially revert commit a421ce088ac8 ("mlxsw: core: Extend cooling
device with cooling levels") that tried to interpret these invalid
cooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels
array is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,
which would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.

drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read

In commit e11f5bd8228f ("drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edid
corruption test") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming
that the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold
`edid[0x7e] + 1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It
completely ignored the fact that the function was passed `num_blocks`
which indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.

Let's fix this by adding a bounds check.

This is important for handling the case where there's an error in the
first block of the EDID. In that case we will call
connector_bad_edid() without having re-allocated memory based on
`edid[0x7e]`.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47445 | drm/msm: Fix null pointer dereference on pointer edp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47445</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix possible stall on recvmsg()

recvmsg() can enter an infinite loop if the caller provides the
MSG_WAITALL, the data present in the receive queue is not sufficient to
fulfill the request, and no more data is received by the peer.

When the above happens, mptcp_wait_data() will always return with
no wait, as the MPTCP_DATA_READY flag checked by such function is
set and never cleared in such code path.

Leveraging the above syzbot was able to trigger an RCU stall:

ice: fix locking for Tx timestamp tracking flush

Commit 4dd0d5c33c3e ("ice: add lock around Tx timestamp tracker flush")
added a lock around the Tx timestamp tracker flow which is used to
cleanup any left over SKBs and prepare for device removal.

This lock is problematic because it is being held around a call to
ice_clear_phy_tstamp. The clear function takes a mutex to send a PHY
write command to firmware. This could lead to a deadlock if the mutex
actually sleeps, and causes the following warning on a kernel with
preemption debugging enabled:

KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of
it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47451 | netfilter: xt_IDLETIMER: fix panic that occurs when timer_type has garbage value</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47451</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: xt_IDLETIMER: fix panic that occurs when timer_type has garbage value

Currently, when the rule related to IDLETIMER is added, idletimer_tg timer
structure is initialized by kmalloc on executing idletimer_tg_create
function. However, in this process timer-&gt;timer_type is not defined to
a specific value. Thus, timer-&gt;timer_type has garbage value and it occurs
kernel panic. So, this commit fixes the panic by initializing
timer-&gt;timer_type using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.

because notifier was last stage where reg-&gt;dev dereference was safe.

Now that nf_tables does the hook removal in .pre_exit, this isn't
needed anymore.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47453 | ice: Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47453</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free

In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux_idx IDA whether
it was allocated or not.  This can potentially cause a crash when
unloading the driver on systems that do not initialize support for RDMA.
But, this free cannot be gated by the status bit for RDMA, since it is
allocated if the driver detects support for RDMA at probe time, but the
driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA
has been allocated at probe time and this would lead to a memory leak.

Initialize aux_idx to an invalid value and check for a valid value when
unloading to determine if an IDA free is necessary.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47454 | powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47454</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the
vestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.

ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format

Commit 6dbf7bb55598 ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
block_write_full_page()") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
from inline inode format to a normal inode format.

The code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents() attempts to zero out
the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
dirtying all pages covering this cluster.  However these pages are
beyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.

This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a ("ocfs2: No need to zero
pages past i_size.") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
the zeroing actually is not needed.

After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
invalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up
with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
still dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then
writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
mark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data
written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.

Simple reproducer for the problem is:

  xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 2000" -c "pwrite 2000 2000" -c "fsync" \
    -c "pwrite 4000 2000" ocfs2_file

After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.

Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()

In commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in
C") kvm_start_guest() became idle_kvm_start_guest(). The old code
allocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the
frame to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's
frame.

idle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C
function, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its
callers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller
frame on the emergency stack.

The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:

  paca_ptrs[i]-&gt;emergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;

So emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency
stack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without
first decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the
regular kernel stack, paca-&gt;kstack, which is initialised to point at an
initial frame that is ready to use.

idle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which
write outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a
stack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the
frame it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so
the saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the
emergency stack allocation.

The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248
bytes above the emergency stack allocation.

In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above
the emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,
either another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of
calls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().

The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are
only used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially
never happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd
crash due to that stack overflowing.

Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely
luck that we aren't corrupting something else.

To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on
entry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for
pt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the
existing stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the
emergency stack.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47466 | mm, slub: fix potential memoryleak in kmem_cache_open()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47466</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reference counting issue happens in the normal path of

Fix this issue by calling kunit_alloc_resource() instead of
kunit_alloc_and_get_resource().

spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses

Currently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new
devices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip
select that's already controlled.  This means that if the SPI device is
itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller
and hence already holding the global spi_add_lock.  Since we only care
about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per
controller, avoiding the deadlock.

This can be easily triggered in the case of spi-mux.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 06:31:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47470 | mm, slub: fix potential use-after-free in slab_debugfs_fops</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47470</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It has been discovered that an unprivileged pod in a different namespace on the same cluster could connect to the Redis server on port 6379. Despite having installed the latest version of the VPC CNI plugin on the EKS cluster, it requires manual enablement through configuration to enforce network policies. This raises concerns that many clients might unknowingly have open access to their Redis servers. This vulnerability could lead to Privilege Escalation to the level of cluster controller, or to information leakage, affecting anyone who does not have strict access controls on their Redis instance. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.8.19, 2.9.15 and 2.10.10.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 19:21:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33525 | A Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Import of organizational units and title of organizational unit" feature in ILIAS ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33525</link><description>A Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Import of organizational units and title of organizational unit" feature in ILIAS 7.20 to 7.30 and ILIAS 8.4 to 8.10 as well as ILIAS 9.0 allows remote authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via XML file upload.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 18:55:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25724 | In RTI Connext Professional 5.3.1 through 6.1.0 before 6.1.1, a buffer overflow in XML parsing from Routing Service, Recording Service, Queu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25724</link><description>In RTI Connext Professional 5.3.1 through 6.1.0 before 6.1.1, a buffer overflow in XML parsing from Routing Service, Recording Service, Queuing Service, and Cloud Discovery Service allows attackers to execute code with the affected service's privileges, compromise the service's integrity, leak sensitive information, or crash the service.

spi: Fix null dereference on suspend

A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be
active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer
dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.

Example order of events leading to the exception:
1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets
   ctlr-&gt;cur_msg
2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()
3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context
4. System is resumed
6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg
   to NULL
7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is
   called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)

Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending by
acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52750 | arm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52750</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer

Prior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly
byte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of
bytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.

This went unnoticed until commit:

  34f66c4c4d5518c1 ("arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD")

Prior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD
early in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of
FNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the
corruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.

After that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to
FPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.

This is a race between open_cached_dir() and cached_dir_lease_break()
where the cache entry for the open directory handle receives a lease
break while creating it.  And before returning from open_cached_dir(),
we put the last reference of the new @cfid because of
!@cfid-&gt;has_lease.

Besides the UAF, while running xfstests a lot of missed lease breaks
have been noticed in tests that run several concurrent statfs(2) calls
on those cached fids

  CIFS: VFS: \\w22-root1.gandalf.test No task to wake, unknown frame...
  CIFS: VFS: \\w22-root1.gandalf.test Cmd: 18 Err: 0x0 Flags: 0x1...

  CIFS: VFS: \\w22-root1.gandalf.test smb buf 000000005aa7316e len 108
  ...

To fix both, in open_cached_dir() ensure that @cfid-&gt;has_lease is set
right before sending out compounded request so that any potential
lease break will be get processed by demultiplex thread while we're
still caching @cfid.  And, if open failed for some reason, re-check
@cfid-&gt;has_lease to decide whether or not put lease reference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52752 | smb: client: fix use-after-free bug in cifs_debug_data_proc_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52752</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface

imon driver probes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the second
interface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got
bound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true, but it's still
possible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a
malformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as
spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as
struct imon_context object although it's a completely different one
that was assigned by another driver.

This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is
really bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem

gfs2: ignore negated quota changes

When lots of quota changes are made, there may be cases in which an
inode's quota information is increased and then decreased, such as when
blocks are added to a file, then deleted from it. If the timing is
right, function do_qc can add pending quota changes to a transaction,
then later, another call to do_qc can negate those changes, resulting
in a net gain of 0. The quota_change information is recorded in the qc
buffer (and qd element of the inode as well). The buffer is added to the
transaction by the first call to do_qc, but a subsequent call changes
the value from non-zero back to zero. At that point it's too late to
remove the buffer_head from the transaction. Later, when the quota sync
code is called, the zero-change qd element is discovered and flagged as
an assert warning. If the fs is mounted with errors=panic, the kernel
will panic.

This is usually seen when files are truncated and the quota changes are
negated by punch_hole/truncate which uses gfs2_quota_hold and
gfs2_quota_unhold rather than block allocations that use gfs2_quota_lock
and gfs2_quota_unlock which automatically do quota sync.

This patch solves the problem by adding a check to qd_check_sync such
that net-zero quota changes already added to the transaction are no
longer deemed necessary to be synced, and skipped.

In this case references are taken for the qd and the slot from do_qc
so those need to be put. The normal sequence of events for a normal
non-zero quota change is as follows:

gfs2_quota_change
   do_qc
      qd_hold
      slot_hold

Later, when the changes are to be synced:

gfs2_quota_sync
   qd_fish
      qd_check_sync

In gfs2_put_super(), whether withdrawn or not, the quota should
be cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().

Otherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcu
callback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting in
use-after-free.

Also, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() is already called
by gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after calling
gfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52761 | riscv: VMAP_STACK overflow detection thread-safe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52761</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: VMAP_STACK overflow detection thread-safe

commit 31da94c25aea ("riscv: add VMAP_STACK overflow detection") added
support for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK. If overflow is detected, CPU switches to
`shadow_stack` temporarily before switching finally to per-cpu
`overflow_stack`.

If two CPUs/harts are racing and end up in over flowing kernel stack, one
or both will end up corrupting each other state because `shadow_stack` is
not per-cpu. This patch optimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by
directly picking per-cpu `overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`.

Following are the changes in this patch

 - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols in destination
   register.
 - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpu overflow stack is
   located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbol requires
   a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH
   (CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel).

Please see Links for additional relevant disccussion and alternative
solution.

mfd: qcom-spmi-pmic: Fix revid implementation

The Qualcomm SPMI PMIC revid implementation is broken in multiple ways.

First, it assumes that just because the sibling base device has been
registered that means that it is also bound to a driver, which may not
be the case (e.g. due to probe deferral or asynchronous probe). This
could trigger a NULL-pointer dereference when attempting to access the
driver data of the unbound device.

Second, it accesses driver data of a sibling device directly and without
any locking, which means that the driver data may be freed while it is
being accessed (e.g. on driver unbind).

Third, it leaks a struct device reference to the sibling device which is
looked up using the spmi_device_from_of() every time a function (child)
device is calling the revid function (e.g. on probe).

Fix this mess by reimplementing the revid lookup so that it is done only
at probe of the PMIC device; the base device fetches the revid info from
the hardware, while any secondary SPMI device fetches the information
from the base device and caches it so that it can be accessed safely
from its children. If the base device has not been probed yet then probe
of a secondary device is deferred.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52766 | i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Fix out of bounds access in hci_dma_irq_handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52766</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record

syzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of
sendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path
gets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough
space for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on
the `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting
with an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the
tls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at
least one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.

It is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously
bailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.
tls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do
the same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52768 | wifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52768</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/port: Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration race

The CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem -&gt;probe() time, establishes a lineage of
ports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of a
CXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the
cxl_port driver.

Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage
goes through a cxl_port -&gt;remove() event, or the memdev goes through a
cxl_mem -&gt;remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the
entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.

The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being
called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to
teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through
-&gt;remove().

That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.
Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed:

1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free
   scenarios like this signature:

drm/amd/display: fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()

When ddc_service_construct() is called, it explicitly checks both the
link type and whether there is something on the link which will
dictate whether the pin is marked as hw_supported.

If the pin isn't set or the link is not set (such as from
unloading/reloading amdgpu in an IGT test) then fail the
amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer() call.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52774 | s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52774</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access

In dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are
counted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against
concurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias
devices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()
is accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic
due to incorrect pointer accesses.

Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue and
counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile data
pointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hot path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52775 | net/smc: avoid data corruption caused by decline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52775</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: avoid data corruption caused by decline

We found a data corruption issue during testing of SMC-R on Redis
applications.

The benchmark has a low probability of reporting a strange error as
shown below.

"Error: Protocol error, got "\xe2" as reply type byte"

Finally, we found that the retrieved error data was as follows:

0xE2 0xD4 0xC3 0xD9 0x04 0x00 0x2C 0x20 0xA6 0x56 0x00 0x16 0x3E 0x0C
0xCB 0x04 0x02 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xE2

It is quite obvious that this is a SMC DECLINE message, which means that
the applications received SMC protocol message.
We found that this was caused by the following situations:

client                  server
        ¦  clc proposal
        -------------&gt;
        ¦  clc accept
        &lt;-------------
        ¦  clc confirm
        -------------&gt;
wait llc confirm
			send llc confirm
        ¦failed llc confirm
        ¦   x------
(after 2s)timeout
                        wait llc confirm rsp

wait decline

(after 1s) timeout
                        (after 2s) timeout
        ¦   decline
        --------------&gt;
        ¦   decline
        &lt;--------------

As a result, a decline message was sent in the implementation, and this
message was read from TCP by the already-fallback connection.

This patch double the client timeout as 2x of the server value,
With this simple change, the Decline messages should never cross or
collide (during Confirm link timeout).

This issue requires an immediate solution, since the protocol updates
involve a more long-term solution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52776 | wifi: ath12k: fix dfs-radar and temperature event locking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52776</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function

When vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function
then the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that
vfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr
rather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security
checks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid.
Therefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass
with the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function.
In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of the
two functions to call.

In a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up
calling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called
security_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have
current-&gt;fs set anymore, which then caused a kernel NULL pointer
dereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() can
be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52780 | net: mvneta: fix calls to page_pool_get_stats</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52780</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The BOS descriptor defines a root descriptor and is the base descriptor for

Function 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()' encounters an iteration issue when
skipping the 'USB_DT_DEVICE_CAPABILITY' descriptor type. This results in
the same descriptor being read repeatedly.

To address this issue, a 'goto' statement is introduced to ensure that the

bonding: stop the device in bond_setup_by_slave()

Commit 9eed321cde22 ("net: lapbether: only support ethernet devices")
has been able to keep syzbot away from net/lapb, until today.

In the following splat [1], the issue is that a lapbether device has
been created on a bonding device without members. Then adding a non
ARPHRD_ETHER member forced the bonding master to change its type.

The fix is to make sure we call dev_close() in bond_setup_by_slave()
so that the potential linked lapbether devices (or any other devices
having assumptions on the physical device) are removed.

A similar bug has been addressed in commit 40baec225765
("bonding: fix panic on non-ARPHRD_ETHER enslave failure")

ext4: fix racy may inline data check in dio write

syzbot reports that the following warning from ext4_iomap_begin()
triggers as of the commit referenced below:

        if (WARN_ON_ONCE(ext4_has_inline_data(inode)))
                return -ERANGE;

This occurs during a dio write, which is never expected to encounter
an inode with inline data. To enforce this behavior,
ext4_dio_write_iter() checks the current inline state of the inode
and clears the MAY_INLINE_DATA state flag to either fall back to
buffered writes, or enforce that any other writers in progress on
the inode are not allowed to create inline data.

The problem is that the check for existing inline data and the state
flag can span a lock cycle. For example, if the ilock is originally
locked shared and subsequently upgraded to exclusive, another writer
may have reacquired the lock and created inline data before the dio
write task acquires the lock and proceeds.

The commit referenced below loosens the lock requirements to allow
some forms of unaligned dio writes to occur under shared lock, but
AFAICT the inline data check was technically already racy for any
dio write that would have involved a lock cycle. Regardless, lift
clearing of the state bit to the same lock critical section that
checks for preexisting inline data on the inode to close the race.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52787 | blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52787</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()

blk_integrity_unregister() can come if queue usage counter isn't held
for one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may be completed with
calling profile-&gt;complete_fn, then kernel panic.

Another constraint is that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called
before bio merge.

Fix the issue by:

- call bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably

- call bio_integrity_prep() before bio merge</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52788 | i915/perf: Fix NULL deref bugs with drm_dbg() calls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52788</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: core: Run atomic i2c xfer when !preemptible

Since bae1d3a05a8b, i2c transfers are non-atomic if preemption is
disabled. However, non-atomic i2c transfers require preemption (e.g. in
wait_for_completion() while waiting for the DMA).

panic() calls preempt_disable_notrace() before calling
emergency_restart(). Therefore, if an i2c device is used for the
restart, the xfer should be atomic. This avoids warnings like:

cxl/region: Do not try to cleanup after cxl_region_setup_targets() fails

Commit 5e42bcbc3fef ("cxl/region: decrement -&gt;nr_targets on error in
cxl_region_attach()") tried to avoid 'eiw' initialization errors when
-&gt;nr_targets exceeded 16, by just decrementing -&gt;nr_targets when
cxl_region_setup_targets() failed.

Commit 86987c766276 ("cxl/region: Cleanup target list on attach error")
extended that cleanup to also clear cxled-&gt;pos and p-&gt;targets[pos]. The
initialization error was incidentally fixed separately by:
Commit 8d4285425714 ("cxl/region: Fix port setup uninitialized variable
warnings") which was merged a few days after 5e42bcbc3fef.

But now the original cleanup when cxl_region_setup_targets() fails
prevents endpoint and switch decoder resources from being reused:

1) the cleanup does not set the decoder's region to NULL, which results
   in future dpa_size_store() calls returning -EBUSY
2) the decoder is not properly freed, which results in future commit
   errors associated with the upstream switch

Now that the initialization errors were fixed separately, the proper
cleanup for this case is to just return immediately. Then the resources
associated with this target get cleanup up as normal when the failed
region is deleted.

The -&gt;nr_targets decrement in the error case also helped prevent
a p-&gt;targets[] array overflow, so add a new check to prevent against
that overflow.

Tested by trying to create an invalid region for a 2 switch * 2 endpoint
topology, and then following up with creating a valid region.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52793 | samples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52793</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

      [ 444.853111] Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc16c9220 by task cat/2105
      ...
      [ 444.853442] The buggy address belongs to the variable:
      [ 444.853443] max_idle+0x0/0xffffffffffffcde0 [intel_powerclamp]

There is a mismatch between the param_get_int and the definition of
max_idle.  Replacing param_get_int with param_get_byte resolves this
issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52795 | vhost-vdpa: fix use after free in vhost_vdpa_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52795</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost-vdpa: fix use after free in vhost_vdpa_probe()

The put_device() calls vhost_vdpa_release_dev() which calls
ida_simple_remove() and frees "v".  So this call to
ida_simple_remove() is a use after free and a double free.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52796 | ipvlan: add ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52796</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvlan: add ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() helper

Inspired by syzbot reports using a stack of multiple ipvlan devices.

Reduce stack size needed in ipvlan_process_v6_outbound() by moving
the flowi6 struct used for the route lookup in an non inlined
helper. ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() needs 120 bytes on the stack,
immediately reclaimed.

Also make sure ipvlan_process_v4_outbound() is not inlined.

We might also have to lower MAX_NEST_DEV, because only syzbot uses
setups with more than four stacked devices.

SUNRPC: Fix RPC client cleaned up the freed pipefs dentries

RPC client pipefs dentries cleanup is in separated rpc_remove_pipedir()
workqueue,which takes care about pipefs superblock locking.
In some special scenarios, when kernel frees the pipefs sb of the
current client and immediately alloctes a new pipefs sb,
rpc_remove_pipedir function would misjudge the existence of pipefs
sb which is not the one it used to hold. As a result,
the rpc_remove_pipedir would clean the released freed pipefs dentries.

To fix this issue, rpc_remove_pipedir should check whether the
current pipefs sb is consistent with the original pipefs sb.

fc_lport_ptp_setup() did not check the return value of fc_rport_create()

this issue by checking return value of fc_rport_create() and log error

l2nbperpage is log2(number of blks per page), and the minimum legal

when subsequently used as shift exponent.

scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool

In practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocated
to a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens, the code
asserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to
crash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list
causing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact
of the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now that
the use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable
scenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver
from recovering and carrying on.

Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL
pointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to
ibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate
failure or recovery action.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52812 | drm/amd: check num of link levels when update pcie param</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52812</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: pcrypt - Fix hungtask for PADATA_RESET

We found a hungtask bug in test_aead_vec_cfg as follows:

INFO: task cryptomgr_test:391009 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

 Kernel panic - not syncing: hung_task: blocked tasks

For padata_do_parallel, when the return err is 0 or -EBUSY, it will call
wait_for_completion(&amp;amp;wait-&gt;completion) in test_aead_vec_cfg. In normal
case, aead_request_complete() will be called in pcrypt_aead_serial and the
return err is 0 for padata_do_parallel. But, when pinst-&gt;flags is
PADATA_RESET, the return err is -EBUSY for padata_do_parallel, and it
won't call aead_request_complete(). Therefore, test_aead_vec_cfg will
hung at wait_for_completion(&amp;amp;wait-&gt;completion), which will cause
hungtask.

The problem comes as following:
(padata_do_parallel)                 |
    rcu_read_lock_bh();              |
    err = -EINVAL;                   |   (padata_replace)
                                     |     pinst-&gt;flags |= PADATA_RESET;
    err = -EBUSY                     |
    if (pinst-&gt;flags &amp; PADATA_RESET) |
        rcu_read_unlock_bh()         |
        return err

In order to resolve the problem, we replace the return err -EBUSY with
-EAGAIN, which means parallel_data is changing, and the caller should call
it again.

v3:
remove retry and just change the return err.
v2:
introduce padata_try_do_parallel() in pcrypt_aead_encrypt and
pcrypt_aead_decrypt to solve the hungtask.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52814 | drm/amdgpu: Fix potential null pointer derefernce</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52814</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Detect IP == ksym.end as part of BPF program

Now that bpf_throw kfunc is the first such call instruction that has
noreturn semantics within the verifier, this also kicks in dead code
elimination in unprecedented ways. For one, any instruction following
a bpf_throw call will never be marked as seen. Moreover, if a callchain
ends up throwing, any instructions after the call instruction to the
eventually throwing subprog in callers will also never be marked as
seen.

The tempting way to fix this would be to emit extra 'int3' instructions
which bump the jited_len of a program, and ensure that during runtime
when a program throws, we can discover its boundaries even if the call
instruction to bpf_throw (or to subprogs that always throw) is emitted
as the final instruction in the program.

An example of such a program would be this:

do_something():
	...
	r0 = 0
	exit

foo():
	r1 = 0
	call bpf_throw
	r0 = 0
	exit

bar(cond):
	if r1 != 0 goto pc+2
	call do_something
	exit
	call foo
	r0 = 0  // Never seen by verifier
	exit	//

main(ctx):
	r1 = ...
	call bar
	r0 = 0
	exit

Here, if we do end up throwing, the stacktrace would be the following:

bpf_throw
foo
bar
main

In bar, the final instruction emitted will be the call to foo, as such,
the return address will be the subsequent instruction (which the JIT
emits as int3 on x86). This will end up lying outside the jited_len of
the program, thus, when unwinding, we will fail to discover the return
address as belonging to any program and end up in a panic due to the
unreliable stack unwinding of BPF programs that we never expect.

To remedy this case, make bpf_prog_ksym_find treat IP == ksym.end as
part of the BPF program, so that is_bpf_text_address returns true when
such a case occurs, and we are able to unwind reliably when the final
instruction ends up being a call instruction.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52829 | wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound write in ath12k_wmi_ext_hal_reg_caps()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix double free in hci_conn_cleanup

syzbot reports a slab use-after-free in hci_conn_hash_flush [1].
After releasing an object using hci_conn_del_sysfs in the
hci_conn_cleanup function, releasing the same object again
using the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put functions causes a double free.
Here's a simplified flow:

hci_conn_del_sysfs:
  hci_dev_put
    put_device
      kobject_put
        kref_put
          kobject_release
            kobject_cleanup
              kfree_const
                kfree(name)

hci_dev_put:
  ...
    kfree(name)

hci_conn_put:
  put_device
    ...
      kfree(name)

This patch drop the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put function
call in hci_conn_cleanup function, because the object is
freed in hci_conn_del_sysfs function.

This patch also fixes the refcounting in hci_conn_add_sysfs() and
hci_conn_del_sysfs() to take into account device_add() failures.

This fixes CVE-2023-28464.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52831 | cpu/hotplug: Don&amp;#x27;t offline the last non-isolated CPU</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52831</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpu/hotplug: Don't offline the last non-isolated CPU

If a system has isolated CPUs via the "isolcpus=" command line parameter,
then an attempt to offline the last housekeeping CPU will result in a
WARN_ON() when rebuilding the scheduler domains and a subsequent panic due
to and unhandled empty CPU mas in partition_sched_domains_locked().

cpuset_hotplug_workfn()
  rebuild_sched_domains_locked()
    ndoms = generate_sched_domains(&amp;amp;doms, &amp;amp;attr);
      cpumask_and(doms[0], top_cpuset.effective_cpus, housekeeping_cpumask(HK_FLAG_DOMAIN));

Thus results in an empty CPU mask which triggers the warning and then the
subsequent crash:

WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 80 at kernel/sched/topology.c:2366 build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408

Aside of the resulting crash, it does not make any sense to offline the last
last housekeeping CPU.

Prevent this by masking out the non-housekeeping CPUs when selecting a
target CPU for initiating the CPU unplug operation via the work queue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52832 | wifi: mac80211: don&amp;#x27;t return unset power in ieee80211_get_tx_power()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52832</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atl1c: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue

This is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 ("net: alx: Work around
the DMA RX overflow issue").

The alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom
allocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround
then created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester.

Instead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and
use skb_reserve() to move away from problematic 0x...fc0 address.

locking/ww_mutex/test: Fix potential workqueue corruption

In some cases running with the test-ww_mutex code, I was seeing
odd behavior where sometimes it seemed flush_workqueue was
returning before all the work threads were finished.

Often this would cause strange crashes as the mutexes would be
freed while they were being used.

Looking at the code, there is a lifetime problem as the
controlling thread that spawns the work allocates the
"struct stress" structures that are passed to the workqueue
threads. Then when the workqueue threads are finished,
they free the stress struct that was passed to them.

Unfortunately the workqueue work_struct node is in the stress
struct. Which means the work_struct is freed before the work
thread returns and while flush_workqueue is waiting.

It seems like a better idea to have the controlling thread
both allocate and free the stress structures, so that we can
be sure we don't corrupt the workqueue by freeing the structure
prematurely.

So this patch reworks the test to do so, and with this change
I no longer see the early flush_workqueue returns.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52837 | nbd: fix uaf in nbd_open</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52837</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

That's because the fix in commit 3fec323339a4 ("drivers: perf: Fix panic
in riscv SBI mmap support") was wrong since there is no need to broadcast
to other cpus when starting a counter, that's only needed in mmap when
the counters could have already been started on other cpus, so simply
remove this broadcast.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52840 | Input: synaptics-rmi4 - fix use after free in rmi_unregister_function()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52840</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The following simple reproducer can cause the issue described above:

int main(void)
{
  int sock;
  struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
    .svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
    .svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_ANY,
    .svm_port = 1234,
  };

  sock = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(addr));
  return 0;
}

This issue occurs because the `buf_alloc` and `fwd_cnt` fields of the
`struct virtio_vsock_hdr` are not initialized when a new skb is allocated
in `virtio_transport_init_hdr()`. This patch resolves the issue by
initializing these fields during allocation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52843 | llc: verify mac len before reading mac header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52843</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

llc: verify mac len before reading mac header

LLC reads the mac header with eth_hdr without verifying that the skb
has an Ethernet header.

Syzbot was able to enter llc_rcv on a tun device. Tun can insert
packets without mac len and with user configurable skb-&gt;protocol
(passing a tun_pi header when not configuring IFF_NO_PI).

Add a mac_len test before all three eth_hdr(skb) calls under net/llc.

There are further uses in include/net/llc_pdu.h. All these are
protected by a test skb-&gt;protocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does not
protect against this tun scenario.

But the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb will
indirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before any
other LLC code.

It is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv, but
not sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assume
an Ethernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3
protocols in principle. The below referenced commit shows that used
to, on top of Token Ring.

At least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the start
of git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced in
this commit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively all
stable kernels should receive this.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52844 | media: vidtv: psi: Add check for kstrdup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52844</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

TIPC bearer-related names including link names must be null-terminated
strings. If a link name which is not null-terminated is passed through
netlink, strstr() and similar functions can cause buffer overrun. This
causes the above issue.

This patch changes the nla_policy for bearer-related names from NLA_STRING
to NLA_NUL_STRING. This resolves the issue by ensuring that only
null-terminated strings are accepted as bearer-related names.

syzbot reported similar uninit-value issue related to bearer names [2]. The
root cause of this issue is that a non-null-terminated bearer name was
passed. This patch also resolved this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52846 | hsr: Prevent use after free in prp_create_tagged_frame()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52846</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This crash is due to the clearing out the cxl_memdev's driver context
(@cxlds) before the subsystem is done with it. This is ultimately due to
the region(s), that this memdev is a member, being torn down and expecting
to be able to de-reference @cxlds, like here:

static int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region *cxlr, int count)
...
                if (cxlds-&gt;rcd)
                        goto endpoint_reset;
...

Fix it by keeping the driver context valid until memdev-device
unregistration, and subsequently the entire stack of related
dependencies, unwinds.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52850 | media: hantro: Check whether reset op is defined before use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52850</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: Fix refcnt handling in padata_free_shell()

In a high-load arm64 environment, the pcrypt_aead01 test in LTP can lead
to system UAF (Use-After-Free) issues. Due to the lengthy analysis of
the pcrypt_aead01 function call, I'll describe the problem scenario
using a simplified model:

Suppose there's a user of padata named `user_function` that adheres to
the padata requirement of calling `padata_free_shell` after `serial()`
has been invoked, as demonstrated in the following code:

```c
struct request {
    struct padata_priv padata;
    struct completion *done;
};

void parallel(struct padata_priv *padata) {
    do_something();
}

void serial(struct padata_priv *padata) {
    struct request *request = container_of(padata,
    				struct request,
				padata);
    complete(request-&gt;done);
}

void user_function() {
    DECLARE_COMPLETION(done)
    padata-&gt;parallel = parallel;
    padata-&gt;serial = serial;
    padata_do_parallel();
    wait_for_completion(&amp;amp;done);
    padata_free_shell();
}
```

In the corresponding padata.c file, there's the following code:

```c
static void padata_serial_worker(struct work_struct *serial_work) {
    ...
    cnt = 0;

    while (!list_empty(&amp;amp;local_list)) {
        ...
        padata-&gt;serial(padata);
        cnt++;
    }

    local_bh_enable();

    if (refcount_sub_and_test(cnt, &amp;amp;pd-&gt;refcnt))
        padata_free_pd(pd);
}
```

Because of the high system load and the accumulation of unexecuted
softirq at this moment, `local_bh_enable()` in padata takes longer
to execute than usual. Subsequently, when accessing `pd-&gt;refcnt`,
`pd` has already been released by `padata_free_shell()`, resulting
in a UAF issue with `pd-&gt;refcnt`.

The fix is straightforward: add `refcount_dec_and_test` before calling
`padata_free_pd` in `padata_free_shell`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52855 | usb: dwc2: fix possible NULL pointer dereference caused by driver concurrency</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52855</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc2: fix possible NULL pointer dereference caused by driver concurrency

In _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue(), "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL" is executed without
holding the lock "hsotg-&gt;lock". In _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue():

    spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;hsotg-&gt;lock, flags);
    ...
	if (!urb-&gt;hcpriv) {
		dev_dbg(hsotg-&gt;dev, "## urb-&gt;hcpriv is NULL ##\n");
		goto out;
	}
    rc = dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(hsotg, urb-&gt;hcpriv); // Use urb-&gt;hcpriv
    ...
out:
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;amp;hsotg-&gt;lock, flags);

When _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue() and _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue() are
concurrently executed, the NULL check of "urb-&gt;hcpriv" can be executed
before "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL". After urb-&gt;hcpriv is NULL, it can be used
in the function call to dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(), which can cause a NULL
pointer dereference.

This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by myself. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract
function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then analyzes the
instructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrency
bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above possible
bug is reported, when my tool analyzes the source code of Linux 6.5.

To fix this possible bug, "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL" should be executed with
holding the lock "hsotg-&gt;lock". After using this patch, my tool never
reports the possible bug, with the kernelconfiguration allyesconfig for
x86_64. Because I have no associated hardware, I cannot test the patch
in runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52856 | drm/bridge: lt8912b: Fix crash on bridge detach</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52856</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: lt8912b: Fix crash on bridge detach

The lt8912b driver, in its bridge detach function, calls
drm_connector_unregister() and drm_connector_cleanup().

drm_connector_unregister() should be called only for connectors
explicitly registered with drm_connector_register(), which is not the
case in lt8912b.

The driver's drm_connector_funcs.destroy hook is set to
drm_connector_cleanup().

Thus the driver should not call either drm_connector_unregister() nor
drm_connector_cleanup() in its lt8912_bridge_detach(), as they cause a
crash on bridge detach:

platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device

Since commit fa1f68db6ca7 ("drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via
file private data"), the miscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside
filp-&gt;private_data, which means that private_data will not be NULL when
wmi_char_open() is called. This might cause memory corruption should
wmi_char_open() be unable to find its driver, something which can
happen when the associated WMI device is deleted in wmi_free_devices().

Fix the problem by using the miscdevice pointer to retrieve the WMI
device data associated with a char device using container_of(). This
also avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI device bound to a
driver with the same name as the original driver.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52865 | clk: mediatek: clk-mt6797: Add check for mtk_alloc_clk_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: uclogic: Fix user-memory-access bug in uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks()

When CONFIG_HID_UCLOGIC=y and CONFIG_KUNIT_ALL_TESTS=y, launch kernel and
then the below user-memory-access bug occurs.

In hid_test_uclogic_params_cleanup_event_hooks(),it call
uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks() with the first arg=NULL, so
when it calls uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(), the hid_get_drvdata()
will access hdev-&gt;dev with hdev=NULL, which will cause below
user-memory-access.

So add a fake_device with quirks member and call hid_set_drvdata()
to assign hdev-&gt;dev-&gt;driver_data which avoids the null-ptr-def bug
for drvdata-&gt;quirks in uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(). After applying
this patch, the below user-memory-access bug never occurs.

tty: n_gsm: fix race condition in status line change on dead connections

gsm_cleanup_mux() cleans up the gsm by closing all DLCIs, stopping all
timers, removing the virtual tty devices and clearing the data queues.
This procedure, however, may cause subsequent changes of the virtual modem
status lines of a DLCI. More data is being added the outgoing data queue
and the deleted kick timer is restarted to handle this. At this point many
resources have already been removed by the cleanup procedure. Thus, a
kernel panic occurs.

Fix this by proving in gsm_modem_update() that the cleanup procedure has
not been started and the mux is still alive.

Note that writing to a virtual tty is already protected by checks against
the DLCI specific connection state.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52873 | clk: mediatek: clk-mt6779: Add check for mtk_alloc_clk_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52873</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/tdx: Zero out the missing RSI in TDX_HYPERCALL macro

In the TDX_HYPERCALL asm, after the TDCALL instruction returns from the
untrusted VMM, the registers that the TDX guest shares to the VMM need
to be cleared to avoid speculative execution of VMM-provided values.

RSI is specified in the bitmap of those registers, but it is missing
when zeroing out those registers in the current TDX_HYPERCALL.

It was there when it was originally added in commit 752d13305c78
("x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handle more arguments"), but was
later removed in commit 1e70c680375a ("x86/tdx: Do not corrupt
frame-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()"), which was correct because %rsi is
later restored in the "pop %rsi".  However a later commit 7a3a401874be
("x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()") removed that "pop %rsi"
but forgot to add the "xor %rsi, %rsi" back.

Fix by adding it back.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52875 | clk: mediatek: clk-mt2701: Add check for mtk_alloc_clk_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52875</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

 RIP: 0010:tracing_release_file_tr+0xc/0x50

What happens here is that the kprobe event creates a trace_event_file
"file" descriptor that represents the file in tracefs to the event. It
maintains state of the event (is it enabled for the given instance?).
Opening the "enable" file gets a reference to the event "file" descriptor
via the open file descriptor. When the kprobe event is deleted, the file is
also deleted from the tracefs system which also frees the event "file"
descriptor.

But as the tracefs file is still opened by user space, it will not be
totally removed until the final dput() is called on it. But this is not
true with the event "file" descriptor that is already freed. If the user
does a write to or simply closes the file descriptor it will reference the
event "file" descriptor that was just freed, causing a use-after-free bug.

To solve this, add a ref count to the event "file" descriptor as well as a
new flag called "FREED". The "file" will not be freed until the last
reference is released. But the FREE flag will be set when the event is
removed to prevent any more modifications to that event from happening,
even if there's still a reference to the event "file" descriptor.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:39:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31840 | An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4.

cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder

Not all decoders have a reset callback.

The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to
have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there
are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder
instance without a commit/reset callback.

Prior to this patch, the -&gt;reset() callback was called unconditionally when
calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,
1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL
type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null
pointer dereference.

Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and
a pass through decoder is reset.

The issue can be reproduced as below,
    1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a
    single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.
    2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48708 | pinctrl: single: fix potential NULL dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48708</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Pirko noted that it's pointless to pass it in the error path, and that

nilfs2: fix underflow in second superblock position calculations

Macro NILFS_SB2_OFFSET_BYTES, which computes the position of the second
superblock, underflows when the argument device size is less than 4096
bytes.  Therefore, when using this macro, it is necessary to check in
advance that the device size is not less than a lower limit, or at least
that underflow does not occur.

The current nilfs2 implementation lacks this check, causing out-of-bound
block access when mounting devices smaller than 4096 bytes:

 I/O error, dev loop0, sector 36028797018963960 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0
 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
 NILFS (loop0): unable to read secondary superblock (blocksize = 1024)

In addition, when trying to resize the filesystem to a size below 4096
bytes, this underflow occurs in nilfs_resize_fs(), passing a huge number
of segments to nilfs_sufile_resize(), corrupting parameters such as the
number of segments in superblocks.  This causes excessive loop iterations
in nilfs_sufile_resize() during a subsequent resize ioctl, causing
semaphore ns_segctor_sem to block for a long time and hang the writer
thread:

sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()

If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registered
trigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the polling
waitqueue gets freed in the following path:

 do_rmdir
   cgroup_rmdir
     kernfs_drain_open_files
       cgroup_file_release
         cgroup_pressure_release
           psi_trigger_destroy

However, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file and
will access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit:

 fput
   ep_eventpoll_release
     ep_free
       ep_remove_wait_queue
         remove_wait_queue

This results in use-after-free as pasted below.

The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (and
consequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.
Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in line
with the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b ("wait: add wake_up_pollfree()")
since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can be
considered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehow
making cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would require
sizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be more
justifiable if we identify more cases like this.

mmc: sdio: fix possible resource leaks in some error paths

If sdio_add_func() or sdio_init_func() fails, sdio_remove_func() can
not release the resources, because the sdio function is not presented
in these two cases, it won't call of_node_put() or put_device().

To fix these leaks, make sdio_func_present() only control whether
device_del() needs to be called or not, then always call of_node_put()
and put_device().

In error case in sdio_init_func(), the reference of 'card-&gt;dev' is
not get, to avoid redundant put in sdio_free_func_cis(), move the
get_device() to sdio_alloc_func() and put_device() to sdio_release_func(),
it can keep the get/put function be balanced.

Without this patch, while doing fault inject test, it can get the
following leak reports, after this fix, the leak is gone.

fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices

When a fbdev with deferred I/O is once opened and closed, the dirty
pages still remain queued in the pageref list, and eventually later
those may be processed in the delayed work.  This may lead to a
corruption of pages, hitting an Oops.

This patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the
pageref list at closing the device for addressing the bug.  A part of
the cleanup code is factored out as a new helper function that is
called from the common fb_release().</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52732 | ceph: blocklist the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52732</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: blocklist the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace

When received corrupted snap trace we don't know what exactly has
happened in MDS side. And we shouldn't continue IOs and metadatas
access to MDS, which may corrupt or get incorrect contents.

This patch will just block all the further IO/MDS requests
immediately and then evict the kclient itself.

The reason why we still need to evict the kclient just after
blocking all the further IOs is that the MDS could revoke the caps
faster.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52733 | s390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52733</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflow

Historically calls to __decompress() didn't specify "out_len" parameter
on many architectures including s390, expecting that no writes beyond
uncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit
2aa14b1ab2c4 ("zstd: import usptream v1.5.2") which includes zstd library
commit 6a7ede3dfccb ("Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer
(#2751)"). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in
the unwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since "out_len" is
not set, it is considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for
optimization needs. On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report
which are often placed right after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the
size of uncompressed kernel image is already known to the decompressor,
so to avoid the problem simply specify it in the "out_len" parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52734 | net: sched: sch: Bounds check priority</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52734</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec

Several functions that take part in codec's initialization and removal
are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the
behavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in
sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component-&gt;probe/remove() instead.

One of the reasons for that is the expectation of
snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of
struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card
components probing commences.

As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually
removed from the system, unsetting -&gt;preset in
snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -&gt; load
scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, during
device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading may
occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52737 | btrfs: lock the inode in shared mode before starting fiemap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52737</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: lock the inode in shared mode before starting fiemap

Currently fiemap does not take the inode's lock (VFS lock), it only locks
a file range in the inode's io tree. This however can lead to a deadlock
if we have a concurrent fsync on the file and fiemap code triggers a fault
when accessing the user space buffer with fiemap_fill_next_extent(). The
deadlock happens on the inode's i_mmap_lock semaphore, which is taken both
by fsync and btrfs_page_mkwrite(). This deadlock was recently reported by
syzbot and triggers a trace like the following:

drm/amdgpu/fence: Fix oops due to non-matching drm_sched init/fini

Currently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw fini
routine - such function is expected to be called only after the
respective init function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully.

Happens that we faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deck
recently, and the function drm_sched_fini() was called even without
its counter-part had been previously called, causing the following oops:

amdgpu: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110

 [...]

To prevent that, check if the drm_sched was properly initialized for a
given ring before calling its fini counter-part.

Notice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field is set as the latest
thing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to "override" the meaning of such
field - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash, and
the sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardless of
the state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as per
Christian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].

   ...

Sometimes, it would also show up as corruption in the free list pointer
and cause crashes.

After bisecting the issue, we found the issue started from commit
e320d3012d25 ("mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages"):

	if (put_page_testzero(page))
		free_the_page(page, order);
	else if (!PageHead(page))
		while (order-- &gt; 0)
			free_the_page(page + (1 &lt;&lt; order), order);

So the problem is the check PageHead is racy because at this point we
already dropped our reference to the page.  So even if we came in with
compound page, the page can already be freed and PageHead can return
false and we will end up freeing all the tail pages causing double free.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52740 | powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigation switch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52740</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip the
interrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with
the interrupt exit code which tests that branch.

Interrupt exit tests this condition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then
again in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recover
the MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exit
again. If the condition changes between these two tests, the MSR and irq
soft-mask state will become corrupted, leading to warnings and possible

MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not get

ice: Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for workqueue

When both ice and the irdma driver are loaded, a warning in
check_flush_dependency is being triggered. This is due to ice driver
workqueue being allocated with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag and the irdma one
is not.

According to kernel documentation, this flag should be set if the
workqueue will be involved in the kernel's memory reclamation flow.
Since it is not, there is no need for the ice driver's WQ to have this
flag set so remove it.

IB/IPoIB: Fix legacy IPoIB due to wrong number of queues

The cited commit creates child PKEY interfaces over netlink will
multiple tx and rx queues, but some devices doesn't support more than 1
tx and 1 rx queues. This causes to a crash when traffic is sent over the
PKEY interface due to the parent having a single queue but the child
having multiple queues.

This patch fixes the number of queues to 1 for legacy IPoIB at the
earliest possible point in time.

   leads to a use after free.
2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to

drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI

Update the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.
During the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called to
transition to the final power state. set_power_state refers to values
from the current state and without current state populated, it could
result in NULL pointer dereference.

For ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supported through ACPI
ATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be queried before
deciding on changing to final power state's link speed. The logic to query
ATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visible
when broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commit

nexthop: Fix division by zero while replacing a resilient group

The resilient nexthop group torture tests in fib_nexthop.sh exposed a
possible division by zero while replacing a resilient group [1]. The
division by zero occurs when the data path sees a resilient nexthop
group with zero buckets.

The tests replace a resilient nexthop group in a loop while traffic is
forwarded through it. The tests do not specify the number of buckets
while performing the replacement, resulting in the kernel allocating a
stub resilient table (i.e, 'struct nh_res_table') with zero buckets.

This table should never be visible to the data path, but the old nexthop
group (i.e., 'oldg') might still be used by the data path when the stub
table is assigned to it.

Fix this by only assigning the stub table to the old nexthop group after
making sure the group is no longer used by the data path.

comedi: Fix memory leak in compat_insnlist()

`compat_insnlist()` handles the 32-bit version of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST`
ioctl (whenwhen `CONFIG_COMPAT` is enabled).  It allocates memory to
temporarily hold an array of `struct comedi_insn` converted from the
32-bit version in user space.  This memory is only being freed if there
is a fault while filling the array, otherwise it is leaked.

Add a call to `kfree()` to fix the leak.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47365 | afs: Fix page leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47365</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix page leak

There's a loop in afs_extend_writeback() that adds extra pages to a write
we want to make to improve the efficiency of the writeback by making it
larger.  This loop stops, however, if we hit a page we can't write back
from immediately, but it doesn't get rid of the page ref we speculatively
acquired.

This was caused by the removal of the cleanup loop when the code switched
from using find_get_pages_contig() to xarray scanning as the latter only
gets a single page at a time, not a batch.

Fix this by putting the page on a ref on an early break from the loop.
Unfortunately, we can't just add that page to the pagevec we're employing
as we'll go through that and add those pages to the RPC call.

This was found by the generic/074 test.  It leaks ~4GiB of RAM each time it
is run - which can be observed with "top".</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47366 | afs: Fix corruption in reads at fpos 2G-4G from an OpenAFS server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47366</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix corruption in reads at fpos 2G-4G from an OpenAFS server

AFS-3 has two data fetch RPC variants, FS.FetchData and FS.FetchData64, and
Linux's afs client switches between them when talking to a non-YFS server
if the read size, the file position or the sum of the two have the upper 32
bits set of the 64-bit value.

This is a problem, however, since the file position and length fields of
FS.FetchData are *signed* 32-bit values.

Fix this by capturing the capability bits obtained from the fileserver when
it's sent an FS.GetCapabilities RPC, rather than just discarding them, and
then picking out the VICED_CAPABILITY_64BITFILES flag.  This can then be
used to decide whether to use FS.FetchData or FS.FetchData64 - and also
FS.StoreData or FS.StoreData64 - rather than using upper_32_bits() to
switch on the parameter values.

This capabilities flag could also be used to limit the maximum size of the
file, but all servers must be checked for that.

Note that the issue does not exist with FS.StoreData - that uses *unsigned*
32-bit values.  It's also not a problem with Auristor servers as its
YFS.FetchData64 op uses unsigned 64-bit values.

This can be tested by cloning a git repo through an OpenAFS client to an
OpenAFS server and then doing "git status" on it from a Linux afs
client[1].  Provided the clone has a pack file that's in the 2G-4G range,
the git status will show errors like:

	error: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index
	error: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index

This can be observed in the server's FileLog with something like the
following appearing:

enetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint

irq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t
parameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be
accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Since
the cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has
only temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), later
accesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding
procfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.

The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which provides
a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47369 | s390/qeth: fix NULL deref in qeth_clear_working_pool_list()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47369</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/qeth: fix NULL deref in qeth_clear_working_pool_list()

When qeth_set_online() calls qeth_clear_working_pool_list() to roll
back after an error exit from qeth_hardsetup_card(), we are at risk of
accessing card-&gt;qdio.in_q before it was allocated by
qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() via qeth_mpc_initialize().

qeth_clear_working_pool_list() then dereferences NULL, and by writing to
queue-&gt;bufs[i].pool_entry scribbles all over the CPU's lowcore.
Resulting in a crash when those lowcore areas are used next (eg. on
the next machine-check interrupt).

Such a scenario would typically happen when the device is first set
online and its queues aren't allocated yet. An early IO error or certain
misconfigs (eg. mismatched transport mode, bad portno) then cause us to
error out from qeth_hardsetup_card() with card-&gt;qdio.in_q still being
NULL.

Fix it by checking the pointer for NULL before accessing it.

Note that we also have (rare) paths inside qeth_mpc_initialize() where
a configuration change can cause us to free the existing queues,
expecting that subsequent code will allocate them again. If we then
error out before that re-allocation happens, the same bug occurs.

mptcp: ensure tx skbs always have the MPTCP ext

Due to signed/unsigned comparison, the expression:

	info-&gt;size_goal - skb-&gt;len &gt; 0

skb size. That results in lack of tx cache refill, so that
the skb allocated by the core TCP code lacks the required
MPTCP skb extensions.

nexthop: Fix memory leaks in nexthop notification chain listeners

syzkaller discovered memory leaks [1] that can be reduced to the
following commands:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole
 # devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0

As part of the reload flow, mlxsw will unregister its netdevs and then
unregister from the nexthop notification chain. Before unregistering
from the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for
nexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw
will not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not
dismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole
nexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop
device.

One way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop
tables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is
error-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the
registration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing
nexthops.

Therefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the
listener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path
and also consistent with the netdev notification chain.

The above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like
register_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate
over the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot
hold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN
driver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop
listener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration
path.

xen/balloon: use a kernel thread instead a workqueue

Today the Xen ballooning is done via delayed work in a workqueue. This
might result in workqueue hangups being reported in case of large

s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery

Commit 0b9902c1fcc5 ("s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery") removed
taking discipline_mutex inside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential
deadlocks. An error path was missed though, that still takes
discipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.

Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured
offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.
Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and
then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking
discipline_mutex.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47383 | tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47383</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit

This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct
containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
with values.

If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
fbcon_display-&gt;vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.

To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will
"fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47384 | hwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47384</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

So split the original sugov_tunables_free() into two functions,
sugov_clear_global_tunables() is just used to clear the global_tunables
and the new sugov_tunables_free() is used as kobj_type::release to
release the sugov_tunables safely.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47388 | mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47388</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX

When PN checking is done in mac80211, for fragmentation we need
to copy the PN to the RX struct so we can later use it to do a
comparison, since commit bf30ca922a0c ("mac80211: check defrag
PN against current frame").

Unfortunately, in that commit I used the 'hdr' variable without
it being necessarily valid, so use-after-free could occur if it
was necessary to reallocate (parts of) the frame.

Fix this by reloading the variable after the code that results
in the reallocations, if any.

This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214401.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47389 | KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47389</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start

DECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails after
RECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API, RECEIVE_START generates a new guest
context and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:

     The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than the LAUNCH_START
     command that generates a new guest context and guest handle.

The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures,
as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEV
guest contexts in the future.

Note, LAUNCH_START suffered the same bug, but was previously fixed by
commit 934002cd660b ("KVM: SVM: Call SEV Guest Decommission if ASID
binding fails").</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47390 | KVM: x86: Fix stack-out-of-bounds memory access from ioapic_write_indirect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47390</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The problem appears to be that 'vcpu_bitmap' is allocated as a single long
on stack and it should really be KVM_MAX_VCPUS long. We also seem to clear
the lower 16 bits of it with bitmap_zero() for no particular reason (my
guess would be that 'bitmap' and 'vcpu_bitmap' variables in
kvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus() caused the confusion: while the later is indeed
16-bit long, the later should accommodate all possible vCPUs).</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47391 | RDMA/cma: Ensure rdma_addr_cancel() happens before issuing more requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47391</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Ensure rdma_addr_cancel() happens before issuing more requests

The FSM can run in a circle allowing rdma_resolve_ip() to be called twice
on the same id_priv. While this cannot happen without going through the
work, it violates the invariant that the same address resolution
background request cannot be active twice.

       CPU 1                                  CPU 2

rdma_resolve_addr():

                           cancel_delayed_work(&amp;amp;req-&gt;work);
	                   if (!list_empty(&amp;amp;req-&gt;list)) == true

      ! rdma_addr_cancel() returns after process_on_req #1 is done

   kfree(id_priv)

			 process_one_req(): for #2
                          addr_handler():
	                    mutex_lock(&amp;amp;id_priv-&gt;handler_mutex);
                            !! Use after free on id_priv

rdma_addr_cancel() expects there to be one req on the list and only
cancels the first one. The self-removal behavior of the work only happens
after the handler has returned. This yields a situations where the
req_list can have two reqs for the same "handle" but rdma_addr_cancel()
only cancels the first one.

The second req remains active beyond rdma_destroy_id() and will
use-after-free id_priv once it inevitably triggers.

Fix this by remembering if the id_priv has called rdma_resolve_ip() and
always cancel before calling it again. This ensures the req_list never
gets more than one item in it and doesn't cost anything in the normal flow
that never uses this strange error path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47392 | RDMA/cma: Fix listener leak in rdma_cma_listen_on_all() failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47392</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When the cmid is eventually destroyed cma_cancel_listens() is not called
due to the wrong state, however the per-device IDs are still holding the

hwmon: (mlxreg-fan) Return non-zero value when fan current state is enforced from sysfs

Fan speed minimum can be enforced from sysfs. For example, setting
current fan speed to 20 is used to enforce fan speed to be at 100%
speed, 19 - to be not below 90% speed, etcetera. This feature provides
ability to limit fan speed according to some system wise
considerations, like absence of some replaceable units or high system
ambient temperature.

Request for changing fan minimum speed is configuration request and can
be set only through 'sysfs' write procedure. In this situation value of
argument 'state' is above nominal fan speed maximum.

Return non-zero code in this case to avoid
thermal_cooling_device_stats_update() call, because in this case
statistics update violates thermal statistics table range.
The issues is observed in case kernel is configured with option
CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS.

mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling

Thomas explained in https://lore.kernel.org/r/87mtoeb4hb.ffs@tglx
that our handling of the hrtimer here is wrong: If the timer fires
late (e.g. due to vCPU scheduling, as reported by Dmitry/syzbot)
then it tries to actually rearm the timer at the next deadline,
which might be in the past already:

 1          2          3          N          N+1
 |          |          |   ...    |          |

 ^ intended to fire here (1)
            ^ next deadline here (2)
                                      ^ actually fired here

The next time it fires, it's later, but will still try to schedule
for the next deadline (now 3), etc. until it catches up with N,
but that might take a long time, causing stalls etc.

Now, all of this is simulation, so we just have to fix it, but
note that the behaviour is wrong even per spec, since there's no
value then in sending all those beacons unaligned - they should be
aligned to the TBTT (1, 2, 3, ... in the picture), and if we're a
bit (or a lot) late, then just resume at that point.

Therefore, change the code to use hrtimer_forward_now() which will
ensure that the next firing of the timer would be at N+1 (in the
picture), i.e. the next interval point after the current time.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47397 | sctp: break out if skb_header_pointer returns NULL in sctp_rcv_ootb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47397</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ixgbe_xdp_setup

The ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference with
some machine (online cpus &lt; 63). This is due to the fact that the
maximum value of num_xdp_queues is nr_cpu_ids. Code is in
"ixgbe_set_rss_queues"".

Here's how the problem repeats itself:
Some machine (online cpus &lt; 63), And user set num_queues to 63 through
ethtool. Code is in the "ixgbe_set_channels",
	adapter-&gt;ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR].limit = count;

It becomes 63.

When user use xdp, "ixgbe_set_rss_queues" will set queues num.
	adapter-&gt;num_rx_queues = rss_i;
	adapter-&gt;num_tx_queues = rss_i;
	adapter-&gt;num_xdp_queues = ixgbe_xdp_queues(adapter);

And rss_i's value is from
	f = &amp;amp;adapter-&gt;ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR];
	rss_i = f-&gt;indices = f-&gt;limit;

So "num_rx_queues" &gt; "num_xdp_queues", when run to "ixgbe_xdp_setup",
	for (i = 0; i &lt; adapter-&gt;num_rx_queues; i++)
		if (adapter-&gt;xdp_ring[i]-&gt;xsk_umem)

It leads to panic.

take the smaller value of num_rx_queues and num_xdp_queues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47400 | net: hns3: do not allow call hns3_nic_net_open repeatedly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47400</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipack: ipoctal: fix stack information leak

The tty driver name is used also after registering the driver and must
specifically not be allocated on the stack to avoid leaking information
to user space (or triggering an oops).

Drivers should not try to encode topology information in the tty device
name but this one snuck in through staging without anyone noticing and
another driver has since copied this malpractice.

Fixing the ABI is a separate issue, but this at least plugs the security
hole.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47402 | net: sched: flower: protect fl_walk() with rcu</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47402</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Write bug in hid-betopff driver.
The problem is the driver assumes the device must have an input report but
some malicious devices violate this assumption.

So this patch checks hid_device's input is non empty before it's been used.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47405 | HID: usbhid: free raw_report buffers in usbhid_stop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47405</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add error checking to ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()

If the call to ext4_map_blocks() fails due to an corrupted file
system, ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks() can get stuck in an infinite
loop.  This could be reproduced by running generic/526 with a file
system that has inline_data and fast_commit enabled.  The system will
repeatedly log to the console:

EXT4-fs warning (device dm-3): ext4_block_to_path:105: block 1074800922 &gt; max in inode 131076

and the stack that it gets stuck in is:

   ext4_block_to_path+0xe3/0x130
   ext4_ind_map_blocks+0x93/0x690
   ext4_map_blocks+0x100/0x660

   ext4_load_journal+0x1f3/0x490
   ext4_fill_super+0x22d4/0x2c00

With this patch, generic/526 still fails, but system is no longer
locking up in a tight loop.  It's likely the root casue is that
fast_commit replay is corrupting file systems with inline_data, and we
probably need to add better error handling in the fast commit replay
code path beyond what is done here, which essentially just breaks the
infinite loop without reporting the to the higher levels of the code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47407 | KVM: x86: Handle SRCU initialization failure during page track init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47407</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: serialize hash resizes and cleanups

Syzbot was able to trigger the following warning [1]

No repro found by syzbot yet but I was able to trigger similar issue
by having 2 scripts running in parallel, changing conntrack hash sizes,
and:

for j in `seq 1 1000` ; do unshare -n /bin/true &gt;/dev/null ; done

It would take more than 5 minutes for net_namespace structures
to be cleaned up.

This is because nf_ct_iterate_cleanup() has to restart everytime
a resize happened.

By adding a mutex, we can serialize hash resizes and cleanups
and also make get_next_corpse() faster by skipping over empty
buckets.

Even without resizes in the picture, this patch considerably
speeds up network namespace dismantles.

block: don't call rq_qos_ops-&gt;done_bio if the bio isn't tracked

rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:

1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver

2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,
such as bios ended from error handling code.

Especially in bio_endio():

1) request queue is referred via bio-&gt;bi_bdev-&gt;bd_disk-&gt;queue, which
may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two
cases

2) q-&gt;rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into
__rq_qos_done_bio()

Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops-&gt;done_bio if
the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()

This happens because the charger functions check for the phy presence
inside the imx_usbmisc_data structure (data-&gt;usb_phy), but the chipidea
core populates the usb_phy passed via 'phys' inside 'struct ci_hdrc'
(ci-&gt;usb_phy) instead.

This causes the NULL pointer dereference inside imx7d_charger_detection().

Fix it by also searching for 'phys' in case 'fsl,usbphy' is not found.

While ftrace is looping over a list of addresses to patch, it always failed
when patching the same function: riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask. Looking at the
backtrace, the illegal instruction is encountered in this same function.
However, patch_text_nosync, after patching the instructions, calls
flush_icache_range. But looking at what happens in this function:

flush_icache_range -&gt; flush_icache_all
                   -&gt; sbi_remote_fence_i
                   -&gt; __sbi_rfence_v02
                   -&gt; riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask

The icache and dcache of the current cpu are never synchronized between the
patching of riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask and calling this same function.

So fix this by flushing the current cpu's icache before asking for the other
cpus to do the same.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47415 | iwlwifi: mvm: Fix possible NULL dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47415</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: mdio: fix memory leak

Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was in
wrong state logic.

MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:
	1. Bus is only allocated
	2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but
	   device_register() was called

In case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()
to correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()
calls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state

To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus-&gt;state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED
_before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be
called even in case of device_register() failure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47417 | libbpf: Fix memory leak in strset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47417</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: fix NULL deref in fifo_set_limit()

syzbot reported another NULL deref in fifo_set_limit() [1]

I could repro the issue with :

unshare -n
tc qd add dev lo root handle 1:0 tbf limit 200000 burst 70000 rate 100Mbit
tc qd replace dev lo parent 1:0 pfifo_fast
tc qd change dev lo root handle 1:0 tbf limit 300000 burst 70000 rate 100Mbit

pfifo_fast does not have a change() operation.
Make fifo_set_limit() more robust about this.

net/sched: sch_taprio: properly cancel timer from taprio_destroy()

There is a comment in qdisc_create() about us not calling ops-&gt;reset()
in some cases.

err_out4:
	/*
	 * Any broken qdiscs that would require a ops-&gt;reset() here?
	 * The qdisc was never in action so it shouldn't be necessary.
	 */

As taprio sets a timer before actually receiving a packet, we need
to cancel it from ops-&gt;destroy, just in case ops-&gt;reset has not
been called.

drm/amdgpu: handle the case of pci_channel_io_frozen only in amdgpu_pci_resume

In current code, when a PCI error state pci_channel_io_normal is detectd,
it will report PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER status to PCI driver, and PCI
driver will continue the execution of PCI resume callback report_resume by
pci_walk_bridge, and the callback will go into amdgpu_pci_resume
finally, where write lock is releasd unconditionally without acquiring
such lock first. In this case, a deadlock will happen when other threads
start to acquire the read lock.

To fix this, add a member in amdgpu_device strucutre to cache
pci_channel_state, and only continue the execution in amdgpu_pci_resume
when it's pci_channel_io_frozen.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47422 | drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: fix file release memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47422</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi: Fix iscsi_task use after free

Commit d39df158518c ("scsi: iscsi: Have abort handler get ref to conn")
added iscsi_get_conn()/iscsi_put_conn() calls during abort handling but
then also changed the handling of the case where we detect an already
completed task where we now end up doing a goto to the common put/cleanup
code. This results in a iscsi_task use after free, because the common
cleanup code will do a put on the iscsi_task.

This reverts the goto and moves the iscsi_get_conn() to after we've checked
if the iscsi_task is valid.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47428 | powerpc/64s: fix program check interrupt emergency stack path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47428</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/64s: fix program check interrupt emergency stack path

Emergency stack path was jumping into a 3: label inside the
__GEN_COMMON_BODY macro for the normal path after it had finished,
rather than jumping over it. By a small miracle this is the correct
place to build up a new interrupt frame with the existing stack
pointer, so things basically worked okay with an added weird looking
700 trap frame on top (which had the wrong -&gt;nip so it didn't decode
bug messages either).

Fix this by avoiding using numeric labels when jumping over non-trivial
macros.

powerpc/64s: Fix unrecoverable MCE calling async handler from NMI

The machine check handler is not considered NMI on 64s. The early
handler is the true NMI handler, and then it schedules the
machine_check_exception handler to run when interrupts are enabled.

This works fine except the case of an unrecoverable MCE, where the true
NMI is taken when MSR[RI] is clear, it can not recover, so it calls
machine_check_exception directly so something might be done about it.

Calling an async handler from NMI context can result in irq state and
other things getting corrupted. This can also trigger the BUG at
  arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h:168
  BUG_ON(!arch_irq_disabled_regs(regs) &amp;&amp; !(regs-&gt;msr &amp; MSR_EE));

Fix this by making an _async version of the handler which is called
in the normal case, and a NMI version that is called for unrecoverable
interrupts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 15:17:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47430 | x86/entry: Clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when CONFIG_X86_SMAP=n</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47430</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/entry: Clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when CONFIG_X86_SMAP=n

Commit

  3c73b81a9164 ("x86/entry, selftests: Further improve user entry sanity checks")

added a warning if AC is set when in the kernel.

Commit

  662a0221893a3d ("x86/entry: Fix AC assertion")

changed the warning to only fire if the CPU supports SMAP.

However, the warning can still trigger on a machine that supports SMAP
but where it's disabled in the kernel config and when running the
syscall_nt selftest, for example:

  ------------[ cut here ]------------

IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_SMAP) could be added to the warning condition, but
even this would not be enough in case SMAP is disabled at boot time with
the "nosmap" parameter.

To be consistent with "nosmap" behaviour, clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when
!CONFIG_X86_SMAP.

Found using entry-fuzz + satrandconfig.

media: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()

Fix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while
addressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:

arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]
arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of
data into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structue
FW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes a
legitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length
of &amp;amp;com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right
structure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains
6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of
the function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual
intention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers
(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).

Fix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS
into new struct config, and use &amp;amp;com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as
the destination address, instead of &amp;amp;com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,
when calling memcpy().

This also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable
-Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten the
FORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:36:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47289 | ACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47289</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference

Commit 71f642833284 ("ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in
for_each_acpi_dev_match()") started doing "acpi_dev_put()" on a pointer

Just make acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than
calling down to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL

scsi: target: Fix NULL dereference on XCOPY completion

CPU affinity control added with commit 39ae3edda325 ("scsi: target: core:
Make completion affinity configurable") makes target_complete_cmd() queue
work on a CPU based on se_tpg-&gt;se_tpg_wwn-&gt;cmd_compl_affinity state.

LIO's EXTENDED COPY worker is a special case in that read/write cmds are
dispatched using the global xcopy_pt_tpg, which carries a NULL se_tpg_wwn
pointer following initialization in target_xcopy_setup_pt().

The NULL xcopy_pt_tpg-&gt;se_tpg_wwn pointer is dereferenced on completion of
any EXTENDED COPY initiated read/write cmds. E.g using the libiscsi
SCSI.ExtendedCopy.Simple test:

xdp, net: Fix use-after-free in bpf_xdp_link_release

The problem occurs between dev_get_by_index() and dev_xdp_attach_link().
At this point, dev_xdp_uninstall() is called. Then xdp link will not be
detached automatically when dev is released. But link-&gt;dev already
points to dev, when xdp link is released, dev will still be accessed,
but dev has been released.

Turns out that the program rejection from e411901c0b77 ("bpf: allow for tailcalls
in BPF subprograms for x64 JIT") is buggy since env-&gt;prog-&gt;aux-&gt;tail_call_reachable
is never true. Commit ebf7d1f508a7 ("bpf, x64: rework pro/epilogue and tailcall
handling in JIT") added a tracker into check_max_stack_depth() which propagates
the tail_call_reachable condition throughout the subprograms. This info is then
assigned to the subprogram's

bpf: Track subprog poke descriptors correctly and fix use-after-free

Subprograms are calling map_poke_track(), but on program release there is no
hook to call map_poke_untrack(). However, on program release, the aux memory
(and poke descriptor table) is freed even though we still have a reference to
it in the element list of the map aux data. When we run map_poke_run(), we then
end up accessing free'd memory, triggering KASAN in prog_array_map_poke_run():

    [...]

In general, subprograms do not necessarily manage their own data structures.
For example, BTF func_info and linfo are just pointers to the main program
structure. This allows reference counting and cleanup to be done on the latter
which simplifies their management a bit. The aux-&gt;poke_tab struct, however,
did not follow this logic. The initial proposed fix for this use-after-free
bug further embedded poke data tracking into the subprogram with proper
reference counting. However, Daniel and Alexei questioned why we were treating
these objects special; I agree, its unnecessary. The fix here removes the per
subprogram poke table allocation and map tracking and instead simply points
the aux-&gt;poke_tab pointer at the main programs poke table. This way, map
tracking is simplified to the main program and we do not need to manage them
per subprogram.

This also means, bpf_prog_free_deferred(), which unwinds the program reference
counting and kfrees objects, needs to ensure that we don't try to double free
the poke_tab when free'ing the subprog structures. This is easily solved by
NULL'ing the poke_tab pointer. The second detail is to ensure that per
subprogram JIT logic only does fixups on poke_tab[] entries it owns. To do
this, we add a pointer in the poke structure to point at the subprogram value
so JITs can easily check while walking the poke_tab structure if the current
entry belongs to the current program. The aux pointer is stable and therefore
suitable for such comparison. On the jit_subprogs() error path, we omit
cleaning up the poke-&gt;aux field because these are only ever referenced from
the JIT side, but on error we will never make it to the JIT, so its fine to
leave them dangling. Removing these pointers would complicate the error path
for no reason. However, we do need to untrack all poke descriptors from the
main program as otherwise they could race with the freeing of JIT memory from
the subprograms. Lastly, a748c6975dea3 ("bpf: propagate poke des

tcp: fix tcp_init_transfer() to not reset icsk_ca_initialized

This commit fixes a bug (found by syzkaller) that could cause spurious
double-initializations for congestion control modules, which could cause
memory leaks or other problems for congestion control modules (like CDG)
that allocate memory in their init functions.

The buggy scenario constructed by syzkaller was something like:

(1) create a TCP socket
(2) initiate a TFO connect via sendto()
(3) while socket is in TCP_SYN_SENT, call setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION),
    which calls:
       tcp_set_congestion_control() -&gt;
         tcp_reinit_congestion_control() -&gt;
           tcp_init_congestion_control()
(4) receive ACK, connection is established, call tcp_init_transfer(),
    set icsk_ca_initialized=0 (without first calling cc-&gt;release()),
    call tcp_init_congestion_control() again.

Note that in this sequence tcp_init_congestion_control() is called
twice without a cc-&gt;release() call in between. Thus, for CC modules
that allocate memory in their init() function, e.g, CDG, a memory leak
may occur. The syzkaller tool managed to find a reproducer that
triggered such a leak in CDG.

The bug was introduced when that commit 8919a9b31eb4 ("tcp: Only init
congestion control if not initialized already")
introduced icsk_ca_initialized and set icsk_ca_initialized to 0 in
tcp_init_transfer(), missing the possibility for a sequence like the
one above, where a process could call setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION) in
state TCP_SYN_SENT (i.e. after the connect() or TFO open sendmsg()),
which would call tcp_init_congestion_control(). It did not intend to
reset any initialization that the user had already explicitly made;
it just missed the possibility of that particular sequence (which
syzkaller managed to find).</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:36:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47305 | dma-buf/sync_file: Don&amp;#x27;t leak fences on merge failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47305</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Currently topology_scale_freq_tick() (which gets called from
scheduler_tick()) may end up using a pointer to "struct
scale_freq_data", which was previously cleared by
topology_clear_scale_freq_source(), as there is no protection in place
here. The users of topology_clear_scale_freq_source() though needs a
guarantee that the previously cleared scale_freq_data isn't used
anymore, so they can free the related resources.

Since topology_scale_freq_tick() is called from scheduler tick, we don't
want to add locking in there. Use the RCU update mechanism instead
(which is already used by the scheduler's utilization update path) to
guarantee race free updates here.

synchronize_rcu() makes sure that all RCU critical sections that started

the original signal handler, an immediate SIGSEGV signal is delivered.

Refactor the stack pointer check code from on_sig_stack() and use the new

alternate signal stack size, this check is still necessary to protect

If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.

We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
iscsi_session_teardown-&gt;iscsi_remove_session-&gt;__iscsi_unbind_session call
to remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there is
no device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47329 | scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix resource leak in case of probe failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47329</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge

There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
bus-&gt;self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv-&gt;parent_pdev is NULL.
Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv-&gt;parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's
ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by
alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply
return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.

scsi: core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid

Commit 66a834d09293 ("scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()")
changed the allocation logic to call put_device() to perform host cleanup
with the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread would
properly be performed in scsi_host_dev_release(). However, in the unlikely
case that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost-&gt;ehandler is set
to ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).

The error handler cleanup code in scsi_host_dev_release() will call
kthread_stop() if shost-&gt;ehandler != NULL which will always be the case
whether the kthread was successfully spawned or not. In the case that it
failed to spawn this has the nasty side effect of trying to dereference an
invalid pointer when kthread_stop() is called. The following splat provides
an example of this behavior in the wild:

media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data

As seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl
implementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting used
as input for driver ioctl handlers.

The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related
bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need
to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it
might still cause an information leak.

To be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer before
calling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initialize
them.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:37:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47340 | jfs: fix GPF in diFree</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47340</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix possible UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system

After commit 618f003199c6 ("ext4: fix memory leak in
ext4_fill_super"), after the file system is remounted read-only, there
is a race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi-&gt;s_mmp_tsk to
point at freed memory, which the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip
over.

Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when it is stopped via
ext4_stop_mmpd().

mwifiex: bring down link before deleting interface

We can deadlock when rmmod'ing the driver or going through firmware
reset, because the cfg80211_unregister_wdev() has to bring down the link
for us, ... which then grab the same wiphy lock.

nl80211_del_interface() already handles a very similar case, with a nice
description:

        /*
         * We hold RTNL, so this is safe, without RTNL opencount cannot
         * reach 0, and thus the rdev cannot be deleted.
         *
         * We need to do it for the dev_close(), since that will call
         * the netdev notifiers, and we need to acquire the mutex there
         * but don't know if we get there from here or from some other
         * place (e.g. "ip link set ... down").
         */
        mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;rdev-&gt;wiphy.mtx);
...

Do similarly for mwifiex teardown, by ensuring we bring the link down
first.

powerpc/mm: Fix lockup on kernel exec fault

The powerpc kernel is not prepared to handle exec faults from kernel.
Especially, the function is_exec_fault() will return 'false' when an
exec fault is taken by kernel, because the check is based on reading
current-&gt;thread.regs-&gt;trap which contains the trap from user.

For instance, when provoking a LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test,
current-&gt;thread.regs-&gt;trap is set to SYSCALL trap (0xc00), and
the fault taken by the kernel is not seen as an exec fault by
set_access_flags_filter().

Commit d7df2443cd5f ("powerpc/mm: Fix spurious segfaults on radix
with autonuma") made it clear and handled it properly. But later on
commit d3ca587404b3 ("powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute
faults") removed that handling, introducing test based on error_code.
And here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1
get cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.

Until commit cbd7e6ca0210 ("powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy
search_exception_tables() verification"), an exec fault from kernel
at a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for
that address in the exception tables. But after that commit the
kernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core mm handling to catch wrong
user accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.
It is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set,
set_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC and voila.
But as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning,
set_access_flags_filter() bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag,
which leads to a forever minor exec fault.

As the kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to
do is to fire in bad_kernel_fault() for any exec fault taken by the
kernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:37:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47351 | ubifs: Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47351</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning

It turns out that SLUB redzoning ("slub_debug=Z") checks from
s-&gt;object_size rather than from s-&gt;inuse (which is normally bumped to
make room for the freelist pointer), so a cache created with an object
size less than 24 would have the freelist pointer written beyond
s-&gt;object_size, causing the redzone to be corrupted by the freelist
pointer.  This was very visible with "slub_debug=ZF":

net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereference

This patch fixes a tunnel_dst null pointer dereference due to lockless
access in the tunnel egress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel the
tunnel_dst pointer is set to NULL without waiting a grace period (i.e.
while it's still usable) and packets egressing are dereferencing it
without checking. Use READ/WRITE_ONCE to annotate the lockless use of
tunnel_id, use RCU for accessing tunnel_dst and make sure it is read
only once and checked in the egress path. The dst is already properly RCU
protected so we don't need to do anything fancy than to make sure
tunnel_id and tunnel_dst are read only once and checked in the egress path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47224 | net: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47224</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used

With the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple and
efficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.
But in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments from
the skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not the
first.

Without this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the first
BD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit_done, and the
remaining BDs are still being processed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47225 | mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47225</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling

Syzbot reports that when you have AP_VLAN interfaces that are up
and close the AP interface they belong to, we get a deadlock. No
surprise - since we dev_close() them with the wiphy mutex held,
which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries to
acquire the wiphy mutex there.

To fix this, we need to do two things:
 1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up, we can't
    easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with
    the wiphy mutex held, but change_interface() is relatively
    rare in drivers anyway, so changing iftype isn't used much
    (and userspace has to fall back to down/change/up anyway)
 2) pull the dev_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutex
    section in the normal stop case</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47226 | x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47226</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer

Both Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to
fail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state.  The actual
conditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems
plausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page
and invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing
XRSTOR on the page in question.

__fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registers
are preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using the
fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail but
modify the registers.

If this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()
could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in without
reloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPU
state that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into the
victim task's user-visible state.

Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent this
situation from corrupting any state.

    microarchitectural conditions".</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47227 | x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47227</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()

The non-compacted slowpath uses __copy_from_user() and copies the entire
user buffer into the kernel buffer, verbatim.  This means that the kernel
buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP.
validate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption, but that
leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.

Prior to XSAVES support, it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer,
completely, but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the
buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but
not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.

Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate()
which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states
to the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for
compacted-format kernel buffers, but it works for both compacted and
non-compacted forms.

Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple
__copy_from_user() operations, but that cost is less important than robust
code in an already slow path.

Some drivers require memory that is marked as EFI boot services

by inserting a new EFI memory descriptor and marking it with the

PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer

Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO_START register
when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
panic:

    SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt

To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
previous one has not finished yet.

If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.

In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.

Links to discussion and patches about this issue:
https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190316161243.29517-1-repk@triplefau.lt/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/971be151d24312cc533989a64bd454b4@www.loen.fr/
https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541

But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.

After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47230 | KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47230</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared

Immediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared so
that the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU's
flag.  If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail
without calling post_leave_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state.

The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a
shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn
will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will
use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1).  SMM has
an entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find
a memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).

can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in mcba_usb

Syzbot reported memory leak in SocketCAN driver for Microchip CAN BUS
Analyzer Tool. The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.

In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is
nothing, that frees them:

1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER
   is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with
   coherent buffers.

Fail log:
| [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected
| [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem)

So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()
explicitly

NOTE:
The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers
is used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47232 | can: j1939: fix Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47232</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: fix Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use

This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the syzbot.

The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue,
without incrementing the ref count. This leads to a Use-after-Free if
the skb is taken concurrently from the session queue due to a CTS.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47233 | regulator: rt4801: Fix NULL pointer dereference if priv-&amp;gt;enable_gpios is NULL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47233</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In commit 24803f38a5c0 ("igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
link down"), the ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() was removed,
because it was also called in igmpv3_clear_delrec().

Rough callgraph:

inetdev_destroy
-&gt; ip_mc_destroy_dev
     -&gt; igmpv3_clear_delrec
        -&gt; ip_mc_clear_src
-&gt; RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev-&gt;ip_ptr, NULL)

However, ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't
release in_dev-&gt;mc_list-&gt;sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the
NULL to dev-&gt;ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained through
inetdev_by_index() and then in_dev-&gt;mc_list-&gt;sources cannot be released
by ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:

sock_close
-&gt; __sock_release
   -&gt; inet_release
      -&gt; ip_mc_drop_socket
         -&gt; inetdev_by_index
         -&gt; ip_mc_leave_src
            -&gt; ip_mc_del_src
               -&gt; ip_mc_del1_src

So we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to free
in_dev-&gt;mc_list-&gt;sources.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47239 | net: usb: fix possible use-after-free in smsc75xx_bind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47239</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: strset: fix message length calculation

Outer nest for ETHTOOL_A_STRSET_STRINGSETS is not accounted for.
This may result in ETHTOOL_MSG_STRSET_GET producing a warning like:

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30967 at net/ethtool/netlink.c:369 ethnl_default_doit+0x87a/0xa20

and a splat.

As usually with such warnings three conditions must be met for the warning
to trigger:
 - there must be no skb size rounding up (e.g. reply_size of 684);
 - string set must be per-device (so that the header gets populated);
 - the device name must be at least 12 characters long.

all in all with current user space it looks like reading priv flags
is the only place this could potentially happen.

The calling function - mptcp_subflow_data_available() - can be invoked
from different contexts:
- plain ssk socket lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp_data_lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp_data_lock + msk socket lock.

Since subflow_error_report() tries to acquire the mptcp_data_lock, the
latter two call chains will cause soft lookup.

This change addresses the issue moving the error reporting call to
outer functions, where the held locks list is known and the we can
acquire only the needed one.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47243 | sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47243</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header

The TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and
cake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length
is 1, the execution flow gets into the loop, reads one byte of the
opcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads
one more byte, which exceeds the length of 1.

This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 ("ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack
out of bounds when parsing TCP options.").

v2 changes:

Added doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP
header. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was
allocated), garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP
header if doff was smaller than 5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47244 | mptcp: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47244</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix page reclaim for dead peer hairpin

When adding a hairpin flow, a firmware-side send queue is created for
the peer net device, which claims some host memory pages for its
internal ring buffer. If the peer net device is removed/unbound before
the hairpin flow is deleted, then the send queue is not destroyed which
leads to a stack trace on pci device remove:

udp: fix race between close() and udp_abort()

Kaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp_lib_lookup().
The root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both
racing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock()
release it before performing destructive actions.

We can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,
instead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing
any action when the critical race happens.

net: rds: fix memory leak in rds_recvmsg

Syzbot reported memory leak in rds. The problem
was in unputted refcount in case of error.

int rds_recvmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size,
		int msg_flags)
{
...

	if (!rds_next_incoming(rs, &amp;amp;inc)) {
		...
	}

After this "if" inc refcount incremented and

	if (rds_cmsg_recv(inc, msg, rs)) {
		ret = -EFAULT;
		goto out;
	}
...
out:
	return ret;
}

in case of rds_cmsg_recv() fail the refcount won't be
decremented. And it's easy to see from ftrace log, that
rds_inc_addref() don't have rds_inc_put() pair in
rds_recvmsg() after rds_cmsg_recv()

drm/amd/display: Fix potential memory leak in DMUB hw_init

[Why]
On resume we perform DMUB hw_init which allocates memory:
dm_resume-&gt;dm_dmub_hw_init-&gt;dc_dmub_srv_create-&gt;kzalloc
That results in memory leak in suspend/resume scenarios.

[How]
Allocate memory for the DC wrapper to DMUB only if it was not
allocated before.
No need to reallocate it on suspend/resume.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:26:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47254 | gfs2: Fix use-after-free in gfs2_glock_shrink_scan</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47254</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The GLF_LRU flag is checked under lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru() to
remove the glock from the lru list in __gfs2_glock_put().

On the shrink scan path, the same flag is cleared under lru_lock but because
of cond_resched_lock(&amp;amp;lru_lock) in gfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the
put side can be made without deleting the glock from the lru list.

Keep GLF_LRU across the race window opened by cond_resched_lock(&amp;amp;lru_lock) to
ensure correct behavior on both sides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under
lru_lock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47255 | kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47255</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer

The function init_cq_frag_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ
fragments buffer cq-&gt;buf, or the temporary cq-&gt;resize_buf that is filled
during CQ resize operation.

However, the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for
getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always
returns CQEs from cq-&gt;buf, which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer,
and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size
of the current cq-&gt;buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.

KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint message

Use the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make a
copy of the string literals consumed by the "nested VM-Enter failed"
tracepoint.  A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepoint
can't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.

Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/or
kvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literals
defined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,
whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live until
kvm is unloaded (or "indefinitely" if kvm is built-in).

This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recently
exposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.

to 1024 bytes and other differences in the specs), while the difference
between 5 and 10Gbps descriptors may be as little as nothing
(in many cases the same tuning is simply good enough).

However if a gadget driver calls usb_assign_descriptors() with
a NULL descriptor for super-speed-plus and is then used on a max 10gbps
configuration, the kernel will crash with a null pointer dereference,
when a 10gbps capable device port + cable + host port combination shows up.
(This wouldn't happen if the gadget max-speed was set to 5gbps, but
it of course defaults to the maximum, and there's no real reason to
artificially limit it)

The fix is to simply use the 5gbps descriptor as the 10gbps descriptor,
if a 10gbps descriptor wasn't provided.

Obviously this won't fix the problem if the 5gbps descriptor is also
NULL, but such cases can't be so trivially solved (and any such gadgets
are unlikely to be used with USB3 ports any way).</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47268 | usb: typec: tcpm: cancel vdm and state machine hrtimer when unregister tcpm port</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47268</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception

There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might
be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
indicate a larger ep index than existing.

By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
index back to the caller.

In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
implementation.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Bail from dwc3_gadget_exit() if dwc-&gt;gadget is NULL

There exists a possible scenario in which dwc3_gadget_init() can fail:
during during host -&gt; peripheral mode switch in dwc3_set_mode(), and
a pending gadget driver fails to bind.  Then, if the DRD undergoes
another mode switch from peripheral-&gt;host the resulting
dwc3_gadget_exit() will attempt to reference an invalid and dangling
dwc-&gt;gadget pointer as well as call dma_free_coherent() on unmapped
DMA pointers.

The exact scenario can be reproduced as follows:
 - Start DWC3 in peripheral mode
 - Configure ConfigFS gadget with FunctionFS instance (or use g_ffs)
 - Run FunctionFS userspace application (open EPs, write descriptors, etc)
 - Bind gadget driver to DWC3's UDC
 - Switch DWC3 to host mode
   =&gt; dwc3_gadget_exit() is called. usb_del_gadget() will put the
	ConfigFS driver instance on the gadget_driver_pending_list
 - Stop FunctionFS application (closes the ep files)
 - Switch DWC3 to peripheral mode
   =&gt; dwc3_gadget_init() fails as usb_add_gadget() calls
	check_pending_gadget_drivers() and attempts to rebind the UDC
	to the ConfigFS gadget but fails with -19 (-ENODEV) because the
	FFS instance is not in FFS_ACTIVE state (userspace has not
	re-opened and written the descriptors yet, i.e. desc_ready!=0).
 - Switch DWC3 back to host mode
   =&gt; dwc3_gadget_exit() is called again, but this time dwc-&gt;gadget
	is invalid.

Although it can be argued that userspace should take responsibility
for ensuring that the FunctionFS application be ready prior to
allowing the composite driver bind to the UDC, failure to do so
should not result in a panic from the kernel driver.

Fix this by setting dwc-&gt;gadget to NULL in the failure path of
dwc3_gadget_init() and add a check to dwc3_gadget_exit() to bail out
unless the gadget pointer is valid.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47273 | usb: dwc3-meson-g12a: fix usb2 PHY glue init when phy0 is disabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47273</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

commit b220c049d519 ("tracing: Check length before giving out
the filter buffer") adds length check to protect trace data
overflow introduced in 0fc1b09ff1ff, seems that this fix can't prevent
overflow entirely, the length check should also take the sizeof
entry-&gt;array[0] into account, since this array[0] is filled the
length of trace data and occupy addtional space and risk overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47275 | bcache: avoid oversized read request in cache missing code path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47275</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcache: avoid oversized read request in cache missing code path

In the cache missing code path of cached device, if a proper location
from the internal B+ tree is matched for a cache miss range, function
cached_dev_cache_miss() will be called in cache_lookup_fn() in the
following code block,
[code block 1]
  526         unsigned int sectors = KEY_INODE(k) == s-&gt;iop.inode
  527                 ? min_t(uint64_t, INT_MAX,
  528                         KEY_START(k) - bio-&gt;bi_iter.bi_sector)
  529                 : INT_MAX;
  530         int ret = s-&gt;d-&gt;cache_miss(b, s, bio, sectors);

Here s-&gt;d-&gt;cache_miss() is the call backfunction pointer initialized as
cached_dev_cache_miss(), the last parameter 'sectors' is an important
hint to calculate the size of read request to backing device of the
missing cache data.

Current calculation in above code block may generate oversized value of
'sectors', which consequently may trigger 2 different potential kernel
panics by BUG() or BUG_ON() as listed below,

1) BUG_ON() inside bch_btree_insert_key(),
[code block 2]
   886         BUG_ON(b-&gt;ops-&gt;is_extents &amp;&amp; !KEY_SIZE(k));
2) BUG() inside biovec_slab(),
[code block 3]
   51         default:
   52                 BUG();
   53                 return NULL;

All the above panics are original from cached_dev_cache_miss() by the
oversized parameter 'sectors'.

Inside cached_dev_cache_miss(), parameter 'sectors' is used to calculate
the size of data read from backing device for the cache missing. This
size is stored in s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 4]
  909    s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors = min(sectors, bio_sectors(bio) + reada);

Then the actual key inserting to the internal B+ tree is generated and
stored in s-&gt;iop.replace_key by the following lines of code,
[code block 5]
  911   s-&gt;iop.replace_key = KEY(s-&gt;iop.inode,
  912                    bio-&gt;bi_iter.bi_sector + s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors,
  913                    s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 1) by BUG_ON() from
the above code block.

And the bio sending to backing device for the missing data is allocated
with hint from s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 6]
  926    cache_bio = bio_alloc_bioset(GFP_NOWAIT,
  927                 DIV_ROUND_UP(s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors, PAGE_SECTORS),
  928                 &amp;amp;dc-&gt;disk.bio_split);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 2) by BUG() from the
agove code block.

Now let me explain how the panics happen with the oversized 'sectors'.
In code block 5, replace_key is generated by macro KEY(). From the
definition of macro KEY(),
[code block 7]
  71 #define KEY(inode, offset, size)                                  \
  72 ((struct bkey) {                                                  \
  73      .high = (1ULL &lt;&lt; 63) | ((__u64) (size) &lt;&lt; 20) | (inode),     \
  74      .low = (offset)                                              \
  75 })

Here 'size' is 16bits width embedded in 64bits member 'high' of struct
bkey. But in code block 1, if "KEY_START(k) - bio-&gt;bi_iter.bi_sector" is
very probably to be larger than (1&lt;&lt;16) - 1, which makes the bkey size
calculation in code block 5 is overflowed. In one bug report the value
of parameter 'sectors' is 131072 (= 1 &lt;&lt; 17), the overflowed 'sectors'
results the overflowed s-&gt;insert_bio_sectors in code block 4, then makes
size field of s-&gt;iop.replace_key to be 0 in code block 5. Then the 0-
sized s-&gt;iop.replace_key is inserted into the internal B+ tree as cache
missing check key (a special key to detect and avoid a racing between
normal write request and cache missing read request) as,
[code block 8]
  915   ret = bch_btree_insert_check_key(b, &amp;amp;s-&gt;op, &amp;amp;s-&gt;iop.replace_key);

Then the 0-sized s-&gt;iop.replace_key as 3rd parameter triggers the bkey
size check BUG_ON() in code block 2, and causes the kernel panic 1).

ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()

It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report
what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
address.

Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely
access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
otherwise report what was in that location.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47277 | kvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47277</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses

KVM's mechanism for accessing guest memory translates a guest physical
address (gpa) to a host virtual address using the right-shifted gpa
(also known as gfn) and a struct kvm_memory_slot.  The translation is
performed in __gfn_to_hva_memslot using the following formula:

      hva = slot-&gt;userspace_addr + (gfn - slot-&gt;base_gfn) * PAGE_SIZE

It is expected that gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory.  However, a guest can access invalid physical addresses
in such a way that the gfn is invalid.

__gfn_to_hva_memslot is called from kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_hva_prot, which first
retrieves a memslot through __gfn_to_memslot.  While __gfn_to_memslot
does check that the gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory or not, a CPU can speculate the result of the check and
continue execution speculatively using an illegal gfn. The speculation
can result in calculating an out-of-bounds hva.  If the resulting host
virtual address is used to load another guest physical address, this
is effectively a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads,
the second of which is data dependent on the first.

Right now it's not clear if there are any cases in which this is
exploitable.  One interesting case was reported by the original author
of this patch, and involves visiting guest page tables on x86.  Right
now these are not vulnerable because the hva read goes through get_user(),
which contains an LFENCE speculation barrier.  However, there are
patches in progress for x86 uaccess.h to mask kernel addresses instead of
using LFENCE; once these land, a guest could use speculation to read
from the VMM's ring 3 address space.  Other architectures such as ARM
already use the address masking method, and would be susceptible to
this same kind of data-dependent access gadgets.  Therefore, this patch
proactively protects from these attacks by masking out-of-bounds gfns
in __gfn_to_hva_memslot, which blocks speculation of invalid hvas.

Sean Christopherson noted that this patch does not cover
kvm_read_guest_offset_cached.  This however is limited to a few bytes
past the end of the cache, and therefore it is unlikely to be useful in
the context of building a chain of data dependent accesses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47278 | bus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47278</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove()

This driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler

drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()

There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due
to retrieving file_priv-&gt;master prior to locking the device's master
mutex.

An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error
found by Syzbot:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803

In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is
because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in
drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv-&gt;master in
drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv-&gt;master was subsequently
freed before the mutex was unlocked.

To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the
pointer from from fpriv-&gt;master. This patch passes the Syzbot
reproducer test.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47281 | ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47281</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()

The timer instance per queue is exclusive, and snd_seq_timer_open()
should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's
checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, but
it's not right, because there is no protection, hence any later
concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer
instance easily.  This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer
instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, as
spotted by syzkaller recently.

For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment of
tmr-&gt;timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47282 | spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47282</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves

Commit 571e31fa60b3 ("spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for
-&gt;prepare_message()") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.
The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[]
in the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.

The commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting the
controller's num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect are
rejected by spi_add_device().

However the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits the number
of *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in the
device tree for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised by
of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to
the statically-sized array prepare_cs[].

As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of
allowed slaves to 24 (which "ought to be enough for anybody"), enforce
the limitation on slave -&gt;setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which is
the number of native chipselects supported by the controller).
An upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47283 | net:sfc: fix non-freed irq in legacy irq mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47283</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/nfc/rawsock.c: fix a permission check bug

The function rawsock_create() calls a privileged function sk_alloc(), which requires a ns-aware check to check net-&gt;user_ns, i.e., ns_capable(). However, the original code checks the init_user_ns using capable(). So we replace the capable() with ns_capable().</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 14:27:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4452 | ElementsKit Pro &amp;lt;= 3.6.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4452</link><description>The ElementsKit Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘url’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node, in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated, and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated, causing a memory leak. In the worst case, depending on how a canister uses the BTreeMap, an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory, or even running out of memory.

This issue has been fixed in  #212 https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/212  by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated and users are asked to upgrade to version 0.6.4.. Tests have been added to prevent regressions of this nature moving forward. Note: Users of stable-structure &lt; 0.6.0 are not affected.

Users who are not storing unbounded types in BTreeMap are not affected and do not need to upgrade. Otherwise, an upgrade to version 0.6.4 is necessary.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 09:46:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-3938 | Bypassing ZkTeco-based OEM devices/ZKTeco biometric authentication system via SQLi in QR code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3938</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in ZkTeco-based OEM devices allows an attacker
