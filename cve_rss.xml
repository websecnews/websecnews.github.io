&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a legitimate command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials.

Prior to commit 2a3b80f, there is a code injection vulnerability in the GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/issues.yml. It does not affect users of the Home Assistant integration itself — it only impacts the GitHub Actions environment for this repository. The vulnerable workflow directly inserted user-controlled content from the issue body (github.event.issue.body) into a Bash conditional without proper sanitization. A malicious GitHub user could craft an issue body that executes arbitrary commands on the GitHub Actions runner in a privileged context whenever an issue is opened. The potential impact is limited to the repository’s CI/CD environment, which could allow access to repository contents or GitHub Actions secrets. This issue has been patched via commit 2a3b80f. Workarounds involve disabling the affected workflow (issues.yml), replacing the unsafe Bash comparison with a safe quoted grep (or a pure GitHub Actions expression check), or ensuring minimal permissions in workflows (permissions: block) to reduce possible impact.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:58:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55195 | @std/toml Prototype Pollution in Node.js and Browser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55195</link><description>@std/toml is the Deno Standard Library.

Prior to version 0.19.2, there is an improper output neutralization vulnerability in AIDE.  An attacker can craft a malicious filename by including terminal escape sequences to hide the addition or removal of the file from the report and/or tamper with the log output. A local user might exploit this to bypass the AIDE detection of malicious files. Additionally the output of extended attribute key names and symbolic links targets are also not properly neutralized. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves configuring AIDE to write the report output to a regular file, redirecting stdout to a regular file, or redirecting the log output written to stderr to a regular file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:13:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54409 | AIDE null pointer dereference when reading incorrectly encoded xattr attributes from database (local DoS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54409</link><description>AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment.

Root Cause: In the bRPC Redis protocol parser code, memory for arrays or strings of corresponding sizes is allocated based on the integers read from the network. If the integer read from the network is too large, it may cause a bad alloc error and lead to the program crashing. Attackers can exploit this feature by sending special data packets to the bRPC service to carry out a denial-of-service attack on it.
The bRPC 1.14.0 version tried to fix this issue by limited the memory allocation size, however, the limitation checking code is not well implemented that may cause integer overflow and evade such limitation. So the 1.14.0 version is also vulnerable, although the integer range that affect version 1.14.0 is different from that affect version &lt; 1.14.0.



Affected scenarios: Using bRPC as a Redis server to provide network services to untrusted clients, or using bRPC as a Redis client to call untrusted Redis services.



How to Fix: we provide two methods, you can choose one of them:

1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.14.1.
2. Apply this patch ( https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3050 ) manually.

No matter you choose which method, you should note that the patch limits the maximum length of memory allocated for each time in the bRPC Redis parser. The default limit is 64M. If some of you redis request or response have a size larger than 64M, you might encounter error after upgrade. For such case, you can modify the gflag redis_max_allocation_size to set a larger limit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:33:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8953 | SourceCodester COVID 19 Testing Management System check_availability.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8953</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in SourceCodester COVID 19 Testing Management System 1.0.

From version 0.15.0 to before 0.19.2, a vulnerability was discovered where the List() calls for Kubernetes Secret and SecretStore resources performed by the PushSecret controller did not apply a namespace selector. This flaw allowed an attacker to use label selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across the cluster, bypassing intended namespace restrictions. An attacker with the ability to create or update PushSecret resources and control SecretStore configurations could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive data from arbitrary namespaces. This could lead to full disclosure of Kubernetes secrets, including credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the cluster. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround for this issue includes auditing and restricting RBAC permissions so that only trusted service accounts can create or update PushSecret and SecretStore resources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 23:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55193 | Active Record logging vulnerable to ANSI escape injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55193</link><description>Active Record connects classes to relational database tables.

Exploitation allows arbitrary code execution when the crafted file is opened.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:44:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2011-10018 | myBB 1.6.4 Backdoor Arbitrary Command Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-10018</link><description>myBB version 1.6.4 was distributed with an unauthorized backdoor embedded in the source code. The backdoor allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting payloads into a specially crafted collapsed cookie. This vulnerability was introduced during packaging and was not part of the intended application logic. Exploitation requires no authentication and results in full compromise of the web server under the context of the web application.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:44:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10055 | ComSndFTP v1.3.7 Beta USER Format String RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10055</link><description>ComSndFTP FTP Server version 1.3.7 Beta contains a format string vulnerability in its handling of the USER command. By sending a specially crafted username containing format specifiers, a remote attacker can overwrite a hardcoded function pointer in memory (specifically WSACleanup from Ws2_32.dll). This allows the attacker to redirect execution flow and bypass DEP protections using a ROP chain, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication and affects default configurations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:44:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2012-10057 | Lattice Semiconductor ispVM System 18.0.2 XCF File Handling Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-10057</link><description>Lattice Semiconductor ispVM System v18.0.2 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in its handling of .xcf project files. When parsing the version attribute of the ispXCF XML tag, the application fails to properly validate input length, allowing a specially crafted file to overwrite memory on the stack. This can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user who opens the file.

By opening streams and then rapidly triggering the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an attacker can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the server are considered closed at the protocol level, even though backend processing continues. This allows a client to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection. This CVE will be updated as affected product details are released.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55280 | Information Disclosure Vulnerability in ZKTeco WL20</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55280</link><description>This vulnerability exists in ZKTeco WL20 due to storage of Wi-Fi credentials, configuration data and system data in plaintext within the device firmware.
