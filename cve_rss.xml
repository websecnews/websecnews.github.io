re-implement Bitcoin Core&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;FindAndDelete()&amp;quot; functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38365</link><description>btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang). The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's "FindAndDelete()" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a "standard" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = " "` and `dataToRemove = "data"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 19:37:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48773 | An issue in WoFit v.7.2.3 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmware update process</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48773</link><description>An issue in WoFit v.7.2.3 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmware update process</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 19:37:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48768 | An issue in almaodo GmbH appinventor.ai_google.almando_control 2.3.1 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmwa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48768</link><description>An issue in almaodo GmbH appinventor.ai_google.almando_control 2.3.1 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmware update process</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 19:38:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47884 | Insecure Temporary File in `foxmarks`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47884</link><description>foxmarks is a CLI read-only interface for Firefox's bookmarks and history.

During initialization of nodes, some configuration parameters are retrieved from management nodes. These parameters embed credentials whose integrity and confidentiality may be important to the security of the HPC configuration. Because these parameters are needed for initialization, there is no available mechanism to ensure access control on the management node, and a mitigation measure is normally put in place to prevent access to unprivileged users. It was discovered that this mitigation measure does not survive a reboot of diskful nodes. (Diskless nodes are not at risk.) The mistake lies in the cloudinit configuration: the iptables configuration should have been in the bootcmd instead of the runcmd section.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 17:17:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44415 | A vulnerability was discovered in DI_8200-16.07.26A1, There is a buffer overflow in the dbsrv_asp function; The strcpy function is executed ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44415</link><description>A vulnerability was discovered in DI_8200-16.07.26A1, There is a buffer overflow in the dbsrv_asp function; The strcpy function is executed without checking the length of the string, leading to a buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 16:57:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44413 | A vulnerability was discovered in DI_8200-16.07.26A1, which has been classified as critical.

In backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/provider/datasource/JdbcProvider.java, PgConfiguration class don't filter any parameters, directly concat user input. So, if the attacker adds some parameters in JDBC url, and connect to evil PG server, the attacker can trigger the PG jdbc deserialization vulnerability, and eventually the attacker can execute through the deserialization vulnerability system commands and obtain server privileges. The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.25.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:53:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45396 | Quicly assertion failures</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45396</link><description>Quicly is an IETF QUIC protocol implementation.

When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This double free occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:53:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45397 | H2O alllows bypassing address-based access control with 0-RTT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45397</link><description>h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When an HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:43:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45403 | H2O assertion failure when HTTP/3 requests are cancelled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45403</link><description>h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When h2o is configured as a reverse proxy and HTTP/3 requests are cancelled by the client, h2o might crash due to an assertion failure. The crash can be exploited by an attacker to mount a Denial-of-Service attack. By default, the h2o standalone server automatically restarts, minimizing the impact. However, HTTP requests that were served concurrently will still be disrupted. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 1ed32b2. Users may disable the use of HTTP/3 to mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:43:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25622 | H2O ignores headers configuration directives</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25622</link><description>h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes, and the inner scopes (e.g., path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level). However, if a header directive is used in the inner scope, all the definition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:31:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8755 | Improper Input Validation vulnerability of Authenticated User in Progress LoadMaster allows : OS Command Injection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8755</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability of Authenticated User in Progress LoadMaster allows : OS Command Injection.This issue affects:
