btrfs: fix race between direct IO write and fsync when using same fd

If we have 2 threads that are using the same file descriptor and one of
them is doing direct IO writes while the other is doing fsync, we have a
race where we can end up either:

1) Attempt a fsync without holding the inode's lock, triggering an
   assertion failures when assertions are enabled;

2) Do an invalid memory access from the fsync task because the file private
   points to memory allocated on stack by the direct IO task and it may be
   used by the fsync task after the stack was destroyed.

The race happens like this:

1) A user space program opens a file descriptor with O_DIRECT;

2) The program spawns 2 threads using libpthread for example;

3) One of the threads uses the file descriptor to do direct IO writes,
   while the other calls fsync using the same file descriptor.

4) Call task A the thread doing direct IO writes and task B the thread
   doing fsyncs;

5) Task A does a direct IO write, and at btrfs_direct_write() sets the
   file's private to an on stack allocated private with the member
   'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set to true;

6) Task B enters btrfs_sync_file() and sees that there's a private
   structure associated to the file which has 'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set
   to true, so it skips locking the inode's VFS lock;

7) Task A completes the direct IO write, and resets the file's private to
   NULL since it had no prior private and our private was stack allocated.
   Then it unlocks the inode's VFS lock;

8) Task B enters btrfs_get_ordered_extents_for_logging(), then the
   assertion that checks the inode's VFS lock is held fails, since task B
   never locked it and task A has already unlocked it.

The stack trace produced is the following:

VMCI: Fix use-after-free when removing resource in vmci_resource_remove()

When removing a resource from vmci_resource_table in
vmci_resource_remove(), the search is performed using the resource
handle by comparing context and resource fields.

It is possible though to create two resources with different types
but same handle (same context and resource fields).

When trying to remove one of the resources, vmci_resource_remove()
may not remove the intended one, but the object will still be freed
as in the case of the datagram type in vmci_datagram_destroy_handle().
vmci_resource_table will still hold a pointer to this freed resource
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

binder: fix UAF caused by offsets overwrite

Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target
buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is
copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds
check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy
overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that
attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the
offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted.

Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary
nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are
left with a dangling pointer triggering a use-after-free. This issue is
made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed):

Squashfs: sanity check symbolic link size

Syzkiller reports a "KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link" bug.

This is caused by an uninitialised page, which is ultimately caused
by a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.

The reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised
page is due to the following sequence of events:

1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic
   link from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value
   3875536935 to inode-&gt;i_size.

2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns
   this corrupted value to the length variable, which being a
   signed int, overflows producing a negative number.

3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that
   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means
   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic
link size is not larger than expected.

Input: uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots


When exercising uinput interface syzkaller may try setting up device
with a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocation
failure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure is
handled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkaller
reports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on the
system which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.

Fix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily
be extended if we see devices that can track more than 100 contacts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46746 | HID: amd_sfh: free driver_data after destroying hid device</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46746</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: amd_sfh: free driver_data after destroying hid device

HID driver callbacks aren't called anymore once hid_destroy_device() has
been called. Hence, hid driver_data should be freed only after the
hid_destroy_device() function returned as driver_data is used in several
callbacks.

I observed a crash with kernel 6.10.0 on my T14s Gen 3, after enabling
KASAN to debug memory allocation, I got this output:

Where pci_reset_bus() users are triggering unlocked secondary bus resets.
Ironically pci_bus_reset(), several calls down from pci_reset_bus(), uses
pci_bus_lock() before issuing the reset which locks everything *but* the
bridge itself.

For the same motivation as adding:

  bridge = pci_upstream_bridge(dev);
  if (bridge)
    pci_dev_lock(bridge);

to pci_reset_function() for the "bus" and "cxl_bus" reset cases, add
pci_dev_lock() for @bus-&gt;self to pci_bus_lock().

bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.

The syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked
via bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()
first.

Martin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL
probably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a
("ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF"). The reason is that the
per-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the self
test case but each BPF function expects it.

Remove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46755 | wifi: mwifiex: Do not return unused priv in mwifiex_get_priv_by_id()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46755</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mwifiex: Do not return unused priv in mwifiex_get_priv_by_id()

mwifiex_get_priv_by_id() returns the priv pointer corresponding to
the bss_num and bss_type, but without checking if the priv is actually
currently in use.
Unused priv pointers do not have a wiphy attached to them which can
lead to NULL pointer dereferences further down the callstack.  Fix
this by returning only used priv pointers which have priv-&gt;bss_mode
set to something else than NL80211_IFTYPE_UNSPECIFIED.

Said NULL pointer dereference happened when an Accesspoint was started
with wpa_supplicant -i mlan0 with this config:

network={
        ssid="somessid"
        mode=2
        frequency=2412
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK WPA-PSK-SHA256
        proto=RSN
        group=CCMP
        pairwise=CCMP
        psk="12345678"
}

When waiting for the AP to be established, interrupting wpa_supplicant
with  and starting it again this happens:

wifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up

Right now it's possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in
rtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because
initialization routine can start getting USB replies before
rtw_dev is fully setup.

The stack trace looks like this:

rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
rtw8821c_query_rx_desc
rtw_usb_rx_handler
...
queue_work
rtw_usb_read_port_complete
...
usb_submit_urb
rtw_usb_rx_resubmit
rtw_usb_init_rx
rtw_usb_probe

So while we do the async stuff rtw_usb_probe continues and calls
rtw_register_hw, which does all kinds of initialization (e.g.
via ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.

Fix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything
is set up.

For me, this bug manifested as:
[    8.893177] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: band wrong, packet dropped
[    8.910904] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: hw-&gt;conf.chandef.chan NULL in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
because I'm using Larry's backport of rtw88 driver with the NULL
checks in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46761 | pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46761</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv

The hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernel
crash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from
the PHB.

The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been
released during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assigned
with NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying to
explicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and
kernel crash.

The patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking
pci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46762 | xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46762</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance

Nothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and
privcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfd
created and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get
removed by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the
former is still using it after dropping the locks.

This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may
be accessed and cause kernel oops.

Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVM
implementation for irqfds.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46763 | fou: Fix null-ptr-deref in GRO.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46763</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fou: Fix null-ptr-deref in GRO.

We observed a null-ptr-deref in fou_gro_receive() while shutting down
a host.  [0]

The NULL pointer is sk-&gt;sk_user_data, and the offset 8 is of protocol
in struct fou.

When fou_release() is called due to netns dismantle or explicit tunnel
teardown, udp_tunnel_sock_release() sets NULL to sk-&gt;sk_user_data.
Then, the tunnel socket is destroyed after a single RCU grace period.

So, in-flight udp4_gro_receive() could find the socket and execute the
FOU GRO handler, where sk-&gt;sk_user_data could be NULL.

Let's use rcu_dereference_sk_user_data() in fou_from_sock() and add NULL
checks in FOU GRO handlers.

If the length of the name string is 1 and the value of name[0] is NULL
byte, an OOB vulnerability occurs in btf_name_valid_section() and the
return value is true, so the invalid name passes the check.

To solve this, you need to check if the first position is NULL byte and

ice: protect XDP configuration with a mutex

The main threat to data consistency in ice_xdp() is a possible asynchronous
PF reset. It can be triggered by a user or by TX timeout handler.

XDP setup and PF reset code access the same resources in the following

* ice_vsi_close() in ice_prepare_for_reset() - already rtnl-locked
* ice_vsi_rebuild() for the PF VSI - not protected
* ice_vsi_open() - already rtnl-locked

With an unfortunate timing, such accesses can result in a crash such as the

The previous way of handling this through returning -EBUSY is not viable,
particularly when destroying AF_XDP socket, because the kernel proceeds
with removal anyway.

There is plenty of code between those calls and there is no need to create
a large critical section that covers all of them, same as there is no need
to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() with rtnl_lock().

Add xdp_state_lock mutex to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() and ice_xdp().

Leaving unprotected sections in between would result in two states that
have to be considered:
1. when the VSI is closed, but not yet rebuild
2. when VSI is already rebuild, but not yet open

The latter case is actually already handled through !netif_running() case,
we just need to adjust flag checking a little. The former one is not as
trivial, because between ice_vsi_close() and ice_vsi_rebuild(), a lot of
hardware interaction happens, this can make adding/deleting rings exit
with an error. Luckily, VSI rebuild is pending and can apply new
configuration for us in a managed fashion.

Therefore, add an additional VSI state flag ICE_VSI_REBUILD_PENDING to
indicate that ice_x

ice: move netif_queue_set_napi to rtnl-protected sections

Currently, netif_queue_set_napi() is called from ice_vsi_rebuild() that is
not rtnl-locked when called from the reset. This creates the need to take
the rtnl_lock just for a single function and complicates the
synchronization with .ndo_bpf. At the same time, there no actual need to
fill napi-to-queue information at this exact point.

Fill napi-to-queue information when opening the VSI and clear it when the
VSI is being closed. Those routines are already rtnl-locked.

Also, rewrite napi-to-queue assignment in a way that prevents inclusion of
XDP queues, as this leads to out-of-bounds writes, such as one below.

can: bcm: Remove proc entry when dev is unregistered.

syzkaller reported a warning in bcm_connect() below. [0]

The repro calls connect() to vxcan1, removes vxcan1, and calls
connect() with ifindex == 0.

Calling connect() for a BCM socket allocates a proc entry.
Then, bcm_sk(sk)-&gt;bound is set to 1 to prevent further connect().

However, removing the bound device resets bcm_sk(sk)-&gt;bound to 0
in bcm_notify().

The 2nd connect() tries to allocate a proc entry with the same
name and sets NULL to bcm_sk(sk)-&gt;bcm_proc_read, leaking the
original proc entry.

Since the proc entry is available only for connect()ed sockets,
let's clean up the entry when the bound netdev is unregistered.

inputs to copy_to_user() after they are subject to bounds checks.

Use array_index_nospec() after the bounds checks to clamp these values
for speculative execution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46775 | drm/amd/display: Validate function returns</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46775</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfs

The superblock buffers of nilfs2 can not only be overwritten at runtime
for modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly swapped, replaced
during resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due to
backing device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion using
the reader/writer semaphore "nilfs-&gt;ns_sem".

Some sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without the
necessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointer
dereferencing and memory access, so fix it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46781 | nilfs2: fix missing cleanup on rollforward recovery error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46781</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix missing cleanup on rollforward recovery error

In an error injection test of a routine for mount-time recovery, KASAN
found a use-after-free bug.

It turned out that if data recovery was performed using partial logs
created by dsync writes, but an error occurred before starting the log
writer to create a recovered checkpoint, the inodes whose data had been
recovered were left in the ns_dirty_files list of the nilfs object and
were not freed.

Fix this issue by cleaning up inodes that have read the recovery data if
the recovery routine fails midway before the log writer starts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:27:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46782 | ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46782</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner

syzbot found an use-after-free Read in ila_nf_input [1]

Issue here is that ila_xlat_exit_net() frees the rhashtable,
then call nf_unregister_net_hooks().

It should be done in the reverse way, with a synchronize_rcu().

This is a good match for a pre_exit() method.

tcp_bpf: fix return value of tcp_bpf_sendmsg()

When we cork messages in psock-&gt;cork, the last message triggers the
flushing will result in sending a sk_msg larger than the current
message size. In this case, in tcp_bpf_send_verdict(), 'copied' becomes
negative at least in the following case:

468         case __SK_DROP:
469         default:
470                 sk_msg_free_partial(sk, msg, tosend);
471                 sk_msg_apply_bytes(psock, tosend);
472                 *copied -= (tosend + delta); // &lt;==== HERE
473                 return -EACCES;

Therefore, it could lead to the following BUG with a proper value of
'copied' (thanks to syzbot). We should not use negative 'copied' as a
return value here.

eventfs: Use list_del_rcu() for SRCU protected list variable

Chi Zhiling reported:

  We found a null pointer accessing in tracefs[1], the reason is that the

  removed in eventfs_remove_rec. so when access the ei_child-&gt;is_freed, the
  panic triggered.

  by the way, the following script can reproduce this panic

  loop1 (){

The fscache_cookie_lru_timer is initialized when the fscache module

If timer_reduce() is called before removing the fscache module,
the fscache_cookie_lru_timer will be added to the timer list of

userfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDs

Patch series "userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check", v2.

The pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different
ways depending on kernel version:

1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit
   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with
   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description
   of the race scenario.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even
   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table
   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).
2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for
   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly
   wide race to hit this.
   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()
   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86
   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().
3. On newer kernels (&gt;=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed
   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),
   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.

I decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one
fix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels
affected by bugs 1+2.


This patch (of 2):

This fixes two issues.

I discovered that the following race can occur:

  mfill_atomic                other thread
  ============                ============
                              
  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]
  
  
                              
    __pte_alloc [no-op]
                              
  
  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))

I have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;
the BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.

On kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b ("mm/pgtable: allow
pte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail"), this can't lead to anything worse than
a BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to
deal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels
(&lt;=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two
BUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.

The second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types
of huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs
(in particular, migration PMDs).

On &lt;=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a
PMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,
fairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which
assumes that the PMD points to a page table.

Breakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will
crash or maybe worse if there is no "struct page" for the address bits in
the migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no
corresponding "struct page" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64
looks different).

If that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what
it wrongly thinks is a page table.

As part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()
before __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for
that after the __pte_alloc() anyway.

Backport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:28:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46788 | tracing/osnoise: Use a cpumask to know what threads are kthreads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46788</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The start_kthread() and stop_thread() code was not always called with the
interface_lock held. This means that the kthread variable could be
unexpectedly changed causing the kthread_stop() to be called on it when it
should not have been, leading to:

mm/slub: add check for s-&gt;flags in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook

When enable CONFIG_MEMCG &amp; CONFIG_KFENCE &amp; CONFIG_KMEMLEAK, the following
warning always occurs,This is because the following call stack occurred:
mem_pool_alloc
    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof
        slab_alloc_node
            kfence_alloc

Once the kfence allocation is successful,slab-&gt;obj_exts will not be empty,
because it has already been assigned a value in kfence_init_pool.

Since in the prepare_slab_obj_exts_hook function,we perform a check for
s-&gt;flags &amp; (SLAB_NO_OBJ_EXT | SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE),the alloc_tag_add function
will not be called as a result.Therefore,ref-&gt;ct remains NULL.

However,when we call mem_pool_free,since obj_ext is not empty, it
eventually leads to the alloc_tag_sub scenario being invoked.  This is
where the warning occurs.

So we should add corresponding checks in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook.
For __GFP_NO_OBJ_EXT case,I didn't see the specific case where it's using
kfence,so I won't add the corresponding check in
alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook for now.

can: mcp251x: fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open

The mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held and
disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while
waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for
the interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying
to acquire the same mutex.

Use disable_irq_nosync() instead because the interrupt handler does

ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref in BYT/CHT boards harder

Since commit 13f58267cda3 ("ASoC: soc.h: don't create dummy Component
via COMP_DUMMY()") dummy codecs declared like this:

SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEF(dummy,
        DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_DUMMY()));

expand to:

static struct snd_soc_dai_link_component dummy[] = {
};

Which means that dummy is a zero sized array and thus dais[i].codecs should
not be dereferenced *at all* since it points to the address of the next
variable stored in the data section as the "dummy" variable has an address
but no size, so even dereferencing dais[0] is already an out of bounds
array reference.

Which means that the if (dais[i].codecs-&gt;name) check added in
commit 7d99a70b6595 ("ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref
in BYT/CHT boards") relies on that the part of the next variable which
the name member maps to just happens to be NULL.

Which apparently so far it usually is, except when it isn't
and then it results in crashes like this one:

x86/tdx: Fix data leak in mmio_read()

The mmio_read() function makes a TDVMCALL to retrieve MMIO data for an
address from the VMM.

Sean noticed that mmio_read() unintentionally exposes the value of an
initialized variable (val) on the stack to the VMM.

This variable is only needed as an output value. It did not need to be
passed to the VMM in the first place.

Do not send the original value of *val to the VMM.

powerpc/qspinlock: Fix deadlock in MCS queue

If an interrupt occurs in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() after we increment
qnodesp-&gt;count and before node-&gt;lock is initialized, another CPU might
see stale lock values in get_tail_qnode(). If the stale lock value happens
to match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the "next" pointer of
the wrong qnode. This causes a deadlock as the former CPU, once it becomes
the head of the MCS queue, will spin indefinitely until it's "next" pointer
is set by its successor in the queue.

Running stress-ng on a 16 core (16EC/16VP) shared LPAR, results in
occasional lockups similar to the following:

   $ stress-ng --all 128 --vm-bytes 80% --aggressive \
               --maximize --oomable --verify  --syslog \
               --metrics  --times  --timeout 5m

ASoC: dapm: Fix UAF for snd_soc_pcm_runtime object

When using kernel with the following extra config,

  - CONFIG_KASAN=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC=y
  - CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=4096

kernel detects that snd_pcm_suspend_all() access a freed
'snd_soc_pcm_runtime' object when the system is suspended, which
leads to a use-after-free bug:

The snd_pcm_sync_stop() has a NULL check on 'substream-&gt;runtime' before
making any access. So we need to always set 'substream-&gt;runtime' to NULL
everytime we kfree() it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:28:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46799 | net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NULL dereference on XDP_TX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46799</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry
from a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it
dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use
rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent
with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that
this expects rcu protection.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:28:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8969 | The SYSCOM Group OMFLOW - Exposure of Sensitive Data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8969</link><description>OMFLOW from The SYSCOM Group has a vulnerability involving the exposure of sensitive data.

This fixes the path:

3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the

a new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (it
is a regular data page). Further down in the same function
(mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page from
header_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO header

btrfs: fix qgroup reserve leaks in cow_file_range

In the buffered write path, the dirty page owns the qgroup reserve until
it creates an ordered_extent.

Therefore, any errors that occur before the ordered_extent is created
must free that reservation, or else the space is leaked. The fstest
generic/475 exercises various IO error paths, and is able to trigger
errors in cow_file_range where we fail to get to allocating the ordered
extent. Note that because we *do* clear delalloc, we are likely to
remove the inode from the delalloc list, so the inodes/pages to not have
invalidate/launder called on them in the commit abort path.

This results in failures at the unmount stage of the test that look like:

  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2018: errno=-5 IO failure
  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in btrfs_replace_file_extents:2416: errno=-5 IO failure
  BTRFS warning (device dm-8 state EA): qgroup 0/5 has unreleased space, type 0 rsv 28672

Cases 2 and 3 in the out_reserve path both pertain to this type of leak

By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well. To be potentially affected all of the following must apply: 1. Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9, 2. Using pages router, &amp; 3. Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`. This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not. There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 22:08:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8904 | Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 129.0.6668.58 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8904</link><description>Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 129.0.6668.58 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

Affected versions of vite were discovered to contain a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when building scripts to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present. DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`. However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server. This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 20:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8951 | SourceCodester Resort Reservation System manage_fee.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8951</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in SourceCodester Resort Reservation System 1.0.

This could allow an attacker to manipulate a pac4j session cookie.

This issue affects Apache Druid versions 0.18.0 through 30.0.0.
Since the druid-pac4j extension is optional and disabled by default, Druid installations not using the druid-pac4j extension are not affected by this vulnerability.

While we are not aware of a way to meaningfully exploit this flaw, we 
nevertheless recommend upgrading to version 30.0.1 or higher which fixes the issue
and ensuring you have a strong 
druid.auth.pac4j.cookiePassphrase as a precaution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45537 | Apache Druid: Users can provide MySQL JDBC properties not on allow list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45537</link><description>Apache Druid allows users with certain permissions to read data from other database systems using JDBC. This functionality allows trusted users to set up Druid lookups or run ingestion tasks. Druid also allows administrators to configure a list of allowed properties that users are able to provide for their JDBC connections. By default, this allowed properties list restricts users to TLS-related properties only. However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list.

Users without the permission to configure JDBC connections are not able to exploit this vulnerability.
CVE-2021-26919 describes a similar vulnerability which was partially addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2.

This issue is fixed in Apache Druid 30.0.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45612 | Insert tag injection via canonical URL in Contao</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45612</link><description>Contao is an Open Source CMS.

A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the `/wireui/button` endpoint, specifically through the `label` query parameter. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `label` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser. The `/wireui/button` endpoint dynamically renders button labels based on user-provided input via the `label` query parameter. Due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of this input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. By crafting such a request, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the browser when the endpoint is accessed. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website. This could lead to: **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information. **User Impersonation**: Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. **Phishing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites. **Content Manipulation**: Altering the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the context of where the affected component is used, but in all cases, it poses a significant risk to user security. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.19.3 and 2.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 18:45:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8946 | MicroPython VFS Unmount vfs.c mp_vfs_umount heap-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8946</link><description>A vulnerability was found in MicroPython 1.23.0.

This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 01:14:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7387 | Openshift/builder: path traversal allows command injection in privileged buildcontainer using docker build strategy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7387</link><description>A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows command injection via path traversal, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the “Docker” strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 01:14:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23237 | The issue was addressed with improved memory handling.

SnappyMail uses the `cleanHtml()` function to cleanup HTML and CSS in emails. Research discovered that the function has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit. Because the function allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to "fix" the broken markup into valid markup. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to inject javascript. However, due to the default Content Security Policy the impact of the exploit is minimal. It could be possible to create an attack which leaks some data when loading images through the proxy.
This way it might be possible to use the proxy to attack the local system, like with `http://localhost:5000/leak`. Another attack could be to load a JavaScript attachment of the email. This is very tricky as the email must link to every possible UID as each email has a unique UID which has a value between 1 and 18446744073709551615 **v2.38.0** and up now remove unsupported HTML elements which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Older versions can install an extension named "Security mXSS" as a mitigation. This will be available at the administration area at `/?admin#/packages`. **NOTE:** this extension can not "fix" malicious code in encrypted messages or (html) attachments as it can't manipulate the JavaScript code for this. It only protects normal message HTML.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 19:43:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42795 | An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability was found in /music/view_user.php?id=3 and /music/controller.php?page=edit_user&amp;id=3 in Kashipara ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42795</link><description>An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability was found in /music/view_user.php?id=3 and /music/controller.php?page=edit_user&amp;amp;id=3 in Kashipara Music Management System v1.0.

Affected is an unknown function of the file /playsms/index.php?app=main&amp;amp;inc=core_auth&amp;amp;route=forgot&amp;amp;op=forgot of the component Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument username/email/captcha leads to code injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The project maintainer was informed early about the issue. Investigation shows that playSMS up to 1.4.3 contained a fix but later versions re-introduced the flaw. As long as the latest version of the playsms/tpl package is used, the software is not affected. Version &gt;=1.4.4 shall fix this issue for sure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 01:38:54 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
