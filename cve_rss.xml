This vulnerability is due to the improper processing of user-provided data that is being read into memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted message to a listening port of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user. With access to the underlying operating system, the attacker could also establish root access on the affected device.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20263 | A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20263</link><description>A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switches and Business 350 Series Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of ACLs on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker does not have control over the conditions that result in the device being in the vulnerable state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20305 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20305</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0933 | Niushop B2B2C Upload.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0933</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Niushop B2B2C V5 and classified as critical.

to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
and PKCS12_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 09:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48622 | In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_loa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48622</link><description>In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks in a crafted .ani file.

When a user logs in, a temporary file which contains the configuration of the device (as visible to that user) is created in the /cache folder. An unauthenticated attacker can then attempt to access such a file by sending a specific request to the device trying to guess the name of such a file. Successful exploitation will reveal configuration information.

Starting in version 3.118.12 and prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web app, but it is possible all clients are affected.

Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injection vulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate the issue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks; and implement proper output encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than executable HTML.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21630 | Zulip non-admins can invite new users to streams they would not otherwise be able to add existing users to</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21630</link><description>Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. A vulnerability in version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:33:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0882 | qwdigital LinkWechat Universal Download Interface resource path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0882</link><description>A vulnerability was found in qwdigital LinkWechat 5.1.0.

The C:\Windows\Temp~nsu.tmp\Au_.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots or when a standard user runs an MSI repair using Splashtop Streamer’s Windows Installer. Since the C:\Windows\Temp~nsu.tmp folder inherits permissions from C:\Windows\Temp and Au_.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 15:34:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0822 | Ovirt: authentication bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0822</link><description>An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in overt-engine.
