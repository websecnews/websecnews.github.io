Version 0.9.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 17:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5054 | Race Condition in Canonical Apport</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5054</link><description>Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.




When handling a crash, the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`, which detects if the crashing process resided in a container, was being called before `consistency_checks`, which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this, if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one, apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container, potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally, given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone, crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd, or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e., if dump mode == 1).</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 17:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5357 | FreeFloat FTP Server PWD Command buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5357</link><description>A vulnerability was found in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0.

read access to the resulting core dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4598</link><description>A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.

A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:38:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1484 | A vulnerability exists in the media upload component of the Asset

Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 06:46:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48485 | FreeScout Vulnerable to Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48485</link><description>FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox.

Prior to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For) due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header.

Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass vulnerability was discovered where multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden.

Prior to versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1, there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a URL encoded string in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:58:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44904 | hdf5 v1.14.6 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the H5VM_memcpyvv function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44904</link><description>hdf5 v1.14.6 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the H5VM_memcpyvv function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:35:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44905 | hdf5 v1.14.6 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the H5Z__filter_scaleoffset function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44905</link><description>hdf5 v1.14.6 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the H5Z__filter_scaleoffset function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:35:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44906 | jhead v3.08 was discovered to contain a heap-use-after-free via the ProcessFile function at jhead.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44906</link><description>jhead v3.08 was discovered to contain a heap-use-after-free via the ProcessFile function at jhead.c.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 03:35:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44612 | Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to transmit sensitive information in plaintext, including control information and device cre...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44612</link><description>Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to transmit sensitive information in plaintext, including control information and device credentials, allowing attackers to possibly intercept and access sensitive information via a man-in-the-middle attack.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:49:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44614 | Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to store users' sensitive information, including credentials and mobile phone numbers, in pl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44614</link><description>Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to store users' sensitive information, including credentials and mobile phone numbers, in plaintext.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:49:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44619 | Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to be configured to transmit on an open Wi-Fi network, allowing attackers to join the networ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44619</link><description>Tinxy WiFi Lock Controller v1 RF was discovered to be configured to transmit on an open Wi-Fi network, allowing attackers to join the network without authentication.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:49:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48757 | An insufficient database Row-Level Security policy in Lovable through 2025-04-15 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to read or write to...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48757</link><description>An insufficient database Row-Level Security policy in Lovable through 2025-04-15 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to read or write to arbitrary database tables of generated sites.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:49:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12224 | idna accepts Punycode labels that do not produce any non-ASCII when decoded</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12224</link><description>Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in punycode by the idna crate from Servo rust-url allows an attacker to create a punycode hostname that one part of a system might treat as distinct while another part of that system would treat as equivalent to another hostname.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:49:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36846 | IO::Compress::Brotli versions prior to 0.007 for Perl have an integer overflow in the bundled Brotli C library</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36846</link><description>A buffer overflow, as described in CVE-2020-8927, exists in the embedded Brotli library.  Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior to version 1.0.8, where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 01:10:22 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
