This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver. XStream 1.4.21 has been patched to detect the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 23:49:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51987 | HTTP Client uses incorrect token after refresh in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51987</link><description>Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync` extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 23:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51998 | Path traversal using file URI scheme without supplying hostname in changedetection.io</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51998</link><description>changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. The validation for the file URI scheme falls short, and results in an attacker being able to read any file on the system. This issue only affects instances with a webdriver enabled, and `ALLOW_FILE_URI` false or not defined. The check used for URL protocol, `is_safe_url`, allows `file:` as a URL scheme. It later checks if local files are permitted, but one of the preconditions for the check is that the URL starts with `file://`. The issue comes with the fact that the file URI scheme is not required to have double slashes. This issue has been addressed in version 0.47.06 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 23:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8424 | WatchGuard Endpoint Protection Privilege Escalation in PSANHost Enables Arbitrary File Delete as SYSTEM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8424</link><description>Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in WatchGuard EPDR, Panda AD360 and Panda Dome on Windows (PSANHost.exe module) allows arbitrary file delete with SYSTEM permissions.

The device uses a custom UDP protocol to start and control video and audio services. The protocol has been partially reverse engineered. Based upon the reverse engineering, no password or username is ever transferred over this protocol. Thus, one can set up the camera connection feed with only the encoded UID. It is possible to set up sessions with the camera over the Internet by using the encoded UID and the custom UDP protocol, because authentication happens at the client side.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 20:42:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-20462 | An issue was discovered on Alecto IVM-100 2019-11-12 devices.

The issue arises from an un-sanitized parameter which could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. Users who self-host and have the login system enabled are affected.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could expose user data, access to user sessions or take unintended actions on behalf of users. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to click a malicious account confirmation link. It is highly recommended to update to version `v1.48.1` or later to mitigate this risk. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Solution

Update to version `v1.48.1` or later where input sanitization has been applied to the account confirmation process.  If updating is not immediately possible,</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:13:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51995 | Logic bug in ajax.render.php allows for bypass of &amp;#x27;backOffice&amp;#x27; access control in Combodo iTop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51995</link><description>Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool.

All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some. The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support. However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself. As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by setting the export disk deliberately. This change has been included in the 3.2.123 release and all users who use the `public` disk are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 17:52:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-11916 | An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.

Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider, which uses HTTP request headers, is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands, such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues.

sched/core: Disable page allocation in task_tick_mm_cid()

With KASAN and PREEMPT_RT enabled, calling task_work_add() in
task_tick_mm_cid() may cause the following splat.

[   63.696416] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
[   63.696416] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 610, name: modprobe

[   63.696416] RCU nest depth: 1, expected: 1

This problem is caused by the following call trace.

  sched_tick() [ acquire rq-&gt;__lock ]
   -&gt; task_tick_mm_cid()
    -&gt; task_work_add()
     -&gt; __kasan_record_aux_stack()

	     -&gt; __rmqueue_pcplist()
	      -&gt; rmqueue_bulk()
	       -&gt; rt_spin_lock()

The rq lock is a raw_spinlock_t. We can't sleep while holding
it. IOW, we can't call alloc_pages() in stack_depot_save_flags().

The task_tick_mm_cid() function with its task_work_add() call was
introduced by commit 223baf9d17f2 ("sched: Fix performance regression
introduced by mm_cid") in v6.4 kernel.

Fortunately, there is a kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() variant that
calls stack_depot_save_flags() while not allowing it to allocate
new pages.  To allow task_tick_mm_cid() to use task_work without
page allocation, a new TWAF_NO_ALLOC flag is added to enable calling
kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() instead of kasan_record_aux_stack()
if set. The task_tick_mm_cid() function is modified to add this new flag.

The possible downside is the missing stack trace in a KASAN report due
to new page allocation required when task_work_add_noallloc() is called
which should be rare.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50141 | ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50141</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

xfrm: validate new SA's prefixlen using SA family when sel.family is unset

This expands the validation introduced in commit 07bf7908950a ("xfrm:
Validate address prefix lengths in the xfrm selector.")

syzbot created an SA with
    usersa.sel.family = AF_UNSPEC
    usersa.sel.prefixlen_s = 128
    usersa.family = AF_INET

Because of the AF_UNSPEC selector, verify_newsa_info doesn't put
limits on prefixlen_{s,d}. But then copy_from_user_state sets
x-&gt;sel.family to usersa.family (AF_INET). Do the same conversion in
verify_newsa_info before validating prefixlen_{s,d}, since that's how
prefixlen is going to be used later on.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50143 | udf: fix uninit-value use in udf_get_fileshortad</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: fix unbalanced rpm put() with fence_fini()

Currently we can call fence_fini() twice if something goes wrong when
sending the GuC CT for the tlb request, since we signal the fence and
return an error, leading to the caller also calling fini() on the error
path in the case of stack version of the flow, which leads to an extra
rpm put() which might later cause device to enter suspend when it
shouldn't. It looks like we can just drop the fini() call since the
fence signaller side will already call this for us.

There are known mysterious splats with device going to sleep even with
an rpm ref, and this could be one candidate.

v2 (Matt B):
  - Prefer warning if we detect double fini()

octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()

build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle
it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

__octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If
skb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we
shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the
octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no
associated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them
up the network stack - they are skipped.

Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers
used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to
mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

net/mlx5e: Don't call cleanup on profile rollback failure

When profile rollback fails in mlx5e_netdev_change_profile, the netdev
profile var is left set to NULL. Avoid a crash when unloading the driver
by not calling profile-&gt;cleanup in such a case.

This was encountered while testing, with the original trigger that
the wq rescuer thread creation got interrupted (presumably due to
Ctrl+C-ing modprobe), which gets converted to ENOMEM (-12) by
mlx5e_priv_init, the profile rollback also fails for the same reason
(signal still active) so the profile is left as NULL, leading to a crash
later in _mlx5e_remove.

Command bitmask have a dedicated bit for MANAGE_PAGES command, this bit
isn't Initialize during command bitmask Initialization, only during

In addition, mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() is trying to trigger
completion for MANAGE_PAGES command as well.

Hence, in case health error occurred before any MANAGE_PAGES command
have been invoke (for example, during mlx5_enable_hca()),
mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() will try to trigger completion for
MANAGE_PAGES command, which will result in null-ptr-deref error.[1]

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using
'seal' mount option, the client will squash all compound request buffers
down for encryption into a single iov in smb2_set_next_command().

SMB2_ioctl_init() allocates a small buffer (448 bytes) to hold the
SMB2_IOCTL request in the first iov, and if the user passes an input
buffer that is greater than 328 bytes, smb2_set_next_command() will
end up writing off the end of @rqst-&gt;iov[0].iov_base as shown below:

  mount.cifs //srv/share /mnt -o ...,seal
  ln -s $(perl -e "print('a')for 1..1024") /mnt/link

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req-&gt;sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """

The commit 83fccfc3940c ("inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer-&gt;entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req-&gt;sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req-&gt;sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req-&gt;sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req-&gt;sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block-&gt;state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since "dump_addr" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print "Registers not stored" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

RDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid CPU lockups due fifo occupancy check loop

Driver waits indefinitely for the fifo occupancy to go below a threshold
as soon as the pacing interrupt is received. This can cause soft lockup on
one of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.

Add a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th
if the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until the
occupancy is below the threshold. This is ensured by the checks in
bnxt_re_pacing_timer_exp and further scheduling the work for pacing based
on the fifo occupancy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50158 | RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix out of bound check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50158</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC("xdp")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&amp;amp;dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC("xdp/devmap")
int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        bpf_printk("ifindex %i", pkt-&gt;ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri-&gt;flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50164 | bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT&amp;#x27;s meaning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50164</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg-&gt;var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that "the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 ("bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type")
got overloaded over time with "the passed buffer is being written to".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a ("bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn-&gt;arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed
altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the
equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50165 | bpf: Preserve param-&amp;gt;string when parsing mount options</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50165</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than
otherwise intended.

This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the
insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like
`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain
of the second host.

(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to
have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for
the domains involved to trigger this problem.)

When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this
bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the
parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.

The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get
converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by
the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its
expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the
(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry
*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier
than otherwise intended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 07:53:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10020 | Heateor Social Login WordPress &amp;lt;= 1.1.35 - Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10020</link><description>The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35.

The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 06:51:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7879 | WP ULike &amp;lt; 4.7.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Widgets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7879</link><description>The WP ULike  WordPress plugin before 4.7.5 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered_html is disallowed</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 06:17:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9934 | Wp-ImageZoom &amp;lt;= 1.1.0 - Reflected XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9934</link><description>The Wp-ImageZoom WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 does not sanitise and escape some parameters before outputting them back in a page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 06:17:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34673 | Improper Input Validation in IpcProtocol in Modem prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows local attackers to cause Denial-of-Service.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34673</link><description>Improper Input Validation in IpcProtocol in Modem prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows local attackers to cause Denial-of-Service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 02:40:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34674 | Improper access control in Contacts prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows physical attackers to access data across multiple user profiles.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34674</link><description>Improper access control in Contacts prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows physical attackers to access data across multiple user profiles.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 02:40:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34675 | Improper access control in Dex Mode prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows physical attackers to temporarily access to unlocked screen.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34675</link><description>Improper access control in Dex Mode prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows physical attackers to temporarily access to unlocked screen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 02:40:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34676 | Out-of-bounds write in parsing subtitle file in libsubextractor.so prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows local attackers to cause memory co...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34676</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in parsing subtitle file in libsubextractor.so prior to SMR Nov-2024 Release 1 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.
