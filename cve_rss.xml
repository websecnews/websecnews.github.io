A man-in-the-middle attacker can assume a victim's identify for access to government, medical, and financial resources, and can also extract personal data from the card, aka the "sPACE (Spoofing Password Authenticated Connection Establishment)" issue. This occurs because of a combination of factors, such as insecure PIN entry (for basic readers) and eid:// deeplinking. The victim must be using a modified eID kernel, which may occur if the victim is tricked into installing a fake version of an official app. NOTE: the BSI position is "ensuring a secure operational environment at the client side is an obligation of the ID card owner."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 22:51:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-40100 | In discovery_thread of Dns64Configuration.cpp, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free.

In file: `index.py`, there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying file paths, an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other variables to form a file path in `_file`. However, `filename` is a route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values including slashes (\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the file being read by assigning a value containing ../ to `filename` and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other files on the host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 21:35:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6123 | Improper Neutralization vulnerability affects OpenText ALM Octane. </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6123</link><description>Improper Neutralization vulnerability affects OpenText ALM Octane version 16.2.100 and above. The vulnerability could result in a remote code execution attack.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 21:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0622 | Local privilege escalation vulnerability could affect OpenText Operations Agent on Non-Windows platforms. </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0622</link><description>Local privilege escalation vulnerability affects OpenText Operations Agent product versions 12.15 and 12.20-12.25 when installed on no-Windows platforms.

As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low severity rating.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 17:30:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6255 | Hardcoded Credentals in SoliClub Mobile App</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6255</link><description>Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability in Utarit Information Technologies SoliPay Mobile App allows Read Sensitive Strings Within an Executable.This issue affects SoliPay Mobile App: before 5.0.8.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5155 | SQLi in Utarit&amp;#x27;s Smart Deposit System</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5155</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Utarit Information Technologies SoliPay Mobile App allows SQL Injection.This issue affects SoliPay Mobile App: before 5.0.8.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4993 | Sensetive Data Exposure in Utarit&amp;#x27;s Soliclub </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4993</link><description>Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in Utarit Information Technologies SoliPay Mobile App allows Collect Data as Provided by Users.This issue affects SoliPay Mobile App: before 5.0.8.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:47:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7081 | SQLi in PosTahsil&amp;#x27;s Online Payment System</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7081</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in POSTAHSİL Online Payment System allows SQL Injection.This issue affects Online Payment System: before 14.02.2024.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:40:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26206 | An improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('cross-site scripting') in Fortinet FortiNAC 9.4.0 -

As part of processing a response ping has to reconstruct the IP header, the ICMP header and if present a "quoted packet," which represents the packet that generated an ICMP error.  The quoted packet again has an IP header and an ICMP header.

The pr_pack() copies received IP and ICMP headers into stack buffers for further processing.  In so doing, it fails to take into account the possible presence of IP option headers following the IP header in either the response or the quoted packet.  When IP options are present, pr_pack() overflows the destination buffer by up to 40 bytes.

The memory safety bugs described above can be triggered by a remote host, causing the ping program to crash.

The ping process runs in a capability mode sandbox on all affected versions of FreeBSD and is thus very constrained in how it can interact with the rest of the system at the point where the bug can occur.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:34:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23090 | AIO credential reference count leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23090</link><description>The aio_aqueue function, used by the lio_listio system call, fails to release a reference to a credential in an error case.

This could potentially lead to user-mode code execution on the host, subject to bhyve's Capsicum sandbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:26:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23088 | 802.11 heap buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23088</link><description>The 802.11 beacon handling routine failed to validate the length of an IEEE 802.11s Mesh ID before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer.

While a FreeBSD Wi-Fi client is in scanning mode (i.e., not associated with a SSID) a malicious beacon frame may overwrite kernel memory, leading to remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:11:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23089 | Out of bound read in elf_note_prpsinfo()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23089</link><description>When dumping core and saving process information, proc_getargv() might return an sbuf which have a sbuf_len() of 0 or -1, which is not properly handled.

An out-of-bound read can happen when user constructs a specially crafted ps_string, which in turn can cause the kernel to crash.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:11:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1488 | Unbound: unrestricted reconfiguration enabled to anyone that may lead to local privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1488</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:11:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23086 | mpr/mps/mpt driver ioctl heap out-of-bounds write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23086</link><description>Handlers for *_CFG_PAGE read / write ioctls in the mpr, mps, and mpt drivers allocated a buffer of a caller-specified size, but copied to it a fixed size header.  Other heap content would be overwritten if the specified size was too small.

Users with access to the mpr, mps or mpt device node may overwrite heap data, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.  Note that the device node is only accessible to root and members of the operator group.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:11:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23087 | Bhyve e82545 device emulation out-of-bounds write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23087</link><description>The e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an Ethernet packet when it is being transmitted.  These include the insertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN header, and TCP segmentation offload ("TSO").  The e1000 device model uses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when simulating these modifications on transmitted packets.

When checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the e1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset in the on-stack buffer.  The offset was not validated for certain packet types.

A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on the host, possibly leading to code execution in the host context.

The bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on the FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of exploiting this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:11:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-23084 | Potential jail escape vulnerabilities in netmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23084</link><description>The total size of the user-provided nmreq to nmreq_copyin() was first computed and then trusted during the copyin.

Affected versions of bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access to &lt;host-path&gt;, allowing the loader to read any file the host user has access to. In the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so to boot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest image.  A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the host accessible to the user running bhyhveload(8), which is often the system root.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 04:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26264 | EBM Technologies RISWEB - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26264</link><description>EBM Technologies RISWEB's specific query function parameter does not properly restrict user input, and this feature page is accessible without login.
