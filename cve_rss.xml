xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface

collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation,
thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces.

The check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was
returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md
interface, and thus the validation was never reached.

Calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi
in the xfrmi_net-&gt;xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the
xfrmi_net-&gt;collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when
the net namespace was taken down [1].

Change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier
in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.

This vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to bypass access controls and perform a limited set of actions typically reserved for higher privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized data modifications. This issue is addressed in the listed patches and family releases, which have been made available to hosted and self-hosted customers, as well as partners.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55164 | content-security-policy-parser Prototype Pollution Vulnerability May Lead to RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55164</link><description>content-security-policy-parser parses content security policy directives. A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier, wherein if a policy name is called __proto__, one can override the Object prototype. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0. A workaround involves disabling prototype method in NodeJS, neutralizing all possible prototype pollution attacks. Provide either --disable-proto=delete (recommended) or --disable-proto=throw as an argument to node to enable this feature.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55010 | Kanboard Authenticated Admin Remote Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization of Events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55010</link><description>Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the ProjectEventActvityFormatter allows admin users the ability to instantiate arbitrary php objects by modifying the event["data"] field in the project_activities table. A malicious actor can update this field to use a php gadget to write a web shell into the /plugins folder, which then gives remote code execution on the host system. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55011 | Kanboard Path Traversal in File Write via Task File Upload Api</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55011</link><description>Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, the createTaskFile method in the API does not validate whether the task_id parameter is a valid task id, nor does it check for path traversal. As a result, a malicious actor could write a file anywhere on the system the app user controls. The impact is limited due to the filename being hashed and having no extension. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:33:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54864 | Hydra missing authentication when triggering evaluations through GitHub and Gitea plugins</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54864</link><description>Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit f7bda02, /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea are called by the corresponding forge without HTTP Basic authentication. Both forges do however feature HMAC signing with a secret key. Triggering an evaluation can be very taxing on the infrastructure when large evaluations are done, introducing potential denial of service attacks on the host running the evaluator. This issue has been patched by commit f7bda02. A workaround involves blocking /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea via a reverse proxy.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:59:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54800 | Hydra persistent XSS in build metrics</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54800</link><description>Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8452 | Unauthenticated leak of sensitive information affecting multiple models from Brother Industries, Ltd., FUJIFILM Business Innovation, Ricoh, Toshiba Tec, and Konica Minolta, Inc.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8452</link><description>By using the "uscan" protocol provided by the eSCL specification, an attacker can discover the serial number of multi-function printers that implement the Brother-provided firmware. This serial number can, in turn, can be leveraged by the flaw described by CVE-2024-51978 to calculate the default administrator password. This flaw is similar to CVE-2024-51977, with the only difference being the protocol by which an attacker can use to learn the remote device's serial number. The eSCL/uscan vector is typically only exposed on the local network.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:35:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5466 | XEE in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway before 22.8R2.3-723 and Iva...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5466</link><description>XEE in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway before 22.8R2.3-723 and Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access before 22.8R1.4 (Fix deployed on 02-Aug-2025) allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to trigger a denial of service</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:11:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5468 | Improper handling of symbolic links in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5468</link><description>Improper handling of symbolic links in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway before 22.8R2.3-723 and Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access before 22.8R1.4 (Fix deployed on 02-Aug-2025) allows a local authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on disk.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5462 | A heap-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway be...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5462</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway before 22.8R2.3-723 and Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access before 22.8R1.4 (Fix deployed on 02-Aug-2025) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:11:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3831 | Exposed SFTP server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3831</link><description>Log files uploaded during troubleshooting by the Harmony SASE agent may have been accessible to unauthorized parties.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:53:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5456 | A buffer over-read vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gatewa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5456</link><description>A buffer over-read vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure before 22.7R2.8 or 22.8R2, Ivanti Policy Secure before 22.7R1.5, Ivanti ZTA Gateway before 2.8R2.3-723 and Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access before 22.8R1.4 (Fix deployed on 02-Aug-2025) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial of service. CWE-125</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:53:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8296 | SQL injection in Ivanti Avalanche before version 6.4.8.8008 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to execute arbitrar...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8296</link><description>SQL injection in Ivanti Avalanche before version 6.4.8.8008 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NASA CryptoLib version 1.4.0 and prior in the IV setup logic for telecommand frames. The problem arises from missing bounds checks when copying the Initialization Vector (IV) into a freshly allocated buffer. An attacker can supply a crafted TC frame that causes the library to write one byte past the end of the heap buffer, leading to heap corruption and undefined behaviour. An attacker supplying a malformed telecommand frame can corrupt heap memory. This leads to undefined behaviour, which could manifest itself as a crash (denial of service) or more severe exploitation. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:46:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40920 | Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP versions 1.018 and earlier for Perl use insecurely generated nonces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40920</link><description>Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP versions 1.018 and earlier for Perl generate nonces using the Perl Data::UUID library.  *  Data::UUID does not use a strong cryptographic source for generating UUIDs.

clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns

What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something
hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  "Wouldn't be able to undo"
may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from
lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.

clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.

There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various
userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve
different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,
but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:16:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45146 | ModelCache for LLM through v0.2.0 was discovered to contain an deserialization vulnerability via the component /manager/data_manager.py.

granted by the user to the main application bundle. An attacker with local user access can
invoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts, leveraging the
application's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of GIMP, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent.

This issue has been fixed in 3.1.4.2 version of GIMP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:12:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8845 | NASM Netwide Assember nasm.c assemble_file stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8845</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in NASM Netwide Assember 2.17rc0.
