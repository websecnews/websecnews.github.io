The issue occurs because usbhs_sys_function_pullup(), which accesses the IP
registers, is executed after the USBHS clocks have been disabled. The
problem is reproducible on the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC starting with the
addition of module stop in the clock enable/disable APIs. With module stop
functionality enabled, a bus error is expected if a master accesses a
module whose clock has been stopped and module stop activated.

Disable the IP clocks at the end of remove.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68328 | firmware: stratix10-svc: fix bug in saving controller data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68328</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel
calls vm_ops-&gt;close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this
results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent
VMA splits entirely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68330 | iio: accel: bmc150: Fix irq assumption regression</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68330</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg-&gt;dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo-&gt;cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo-&gt;resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68332 | comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68332</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Add support for Van Gogh SoC

The ROG Xbox Ally (non-X) SoC features a similar architecture to the
Steam Deck. While the Steam Deck supports S3 (s2idle causes a crash),
this support was dropped by the Xbox Ally which only S0ix suspend.

Since the handler is missing here, this causes the device to not suspend
and the AMD GPU driver to crash while trying to resume afterwards due to
a power hang.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68335 | comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68335</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev-&gt;read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
&amp;amp;struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
&amp;amp;s-&gt;async-&gt;cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own -&gt;cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

[1] Syzbot crash:

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10021 | A Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability exists in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK static versions (mt) before 2026.12.
