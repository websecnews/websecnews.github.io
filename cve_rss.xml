Starting in version 1.13.0 and prior to versions 1.13.7, 1.14.12, and 1.15.6, the output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled. Users of the TLS inspection, Ingress with TLS termination, Gateway API with TLS termination, and Kafka network policies with API key filtering features are affected. The sensitive data includes the CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API and the API keys used in Kafka-related network policy. `cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.6, v1.14.12, and v1.13.17. There is no workaround to this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 16:33:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35328 | libyaml v0.2.5 is vulnerable to DDOS.

CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal servers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37306 | CVAT&amp;#x27;s export and backup-related API endpoints are susceptible to CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37306</link><description>Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, if an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can be chosen by the attacker. This implies that the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in any cloud storage that the victim can access and, if the attacker has read access to the cloud storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export. Version 2.14.3 contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37309 | Client initialized Session-Renegotiation DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37309</link><description>CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37849 | A SQL Injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Billing System 1.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in process.php via the us...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37849</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Billing System 1.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in process.php via the username parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22333 | IBM Maximo Application Suite information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22333</link><description>IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.1.3 and IBM Maximo Application Suite 8.10 and 8.11 allows web pages to be stored locally which can be read by another user on the system.

JupyterHub &lt; 5.0, when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0, but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 15:29:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28964 | Dell Common Event Enabler, version 8.9.10.0 and prior, contain an insecure deserialization vulnerability in CAVATools.

The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks. This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user inputs a Markdown autolink such as ``, the link is rendered without proper sanitization. This means that the JavaScript code within the autolink can be executed by the browser, leading to an XSS attack.

This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 11:42:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1766 | Download Manager &amp;lt;= 3.2.86 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1766</link><description>The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2698 | Freeipa: delegation rules allow a proxy service to impersonate any user to access another target service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2698</link><description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:10:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3925 | Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp;amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) &amp;lt;= 5.6.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via onclick events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3925</link><description>The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Creative Button widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 21:59:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5830 | Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 126.0.6478.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafte...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5830</link><description>Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 126.0.6478.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page.

escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37293</link><description>The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:54:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34768 | WordPress Fastly plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.25 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34768</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Fastly.This issue affects Fastly: from n/a through 1.2.25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48273 | WordPress Preloader for Website plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.2 - Unauthenticated Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48273</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP OnlineSupport, Essential Plugin Preloader for Website.This issue affects Preloader for Website: from n/a through 1.2.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52227 | WordPress MailerLite – WooCommerce integration plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.8 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52227</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in MailerLite MailerLite – WooCommerce integration.This issue affects MailerLite – WooCommerce integration: from n/a through 2.0.8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34799 | WordPress BookingPress plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.82 - Appointment Duration Manipulation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34799</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Repute Infosystems BookingPress.This issue affects BookingPress: from n/a through 1.0.82.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52224 | WordPress Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;= 4.9.7 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52224</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Revolut Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce.This issue affects Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce: from n/a through 4.9.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:33:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26330 | An issue was discovered in Kape CyberGhostVPN 8.4.3.12823 on Windows.

In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35665 | WordPress Insert Post Ads plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.2 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35665</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in namithjawahar Insert Post Ads.This issue affects Insert Post Ads: from n/a through 1.3.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35667 | WordPress Shopping Cart &amp;amp; eCommerce Store plugin &amp;lt;= 5.5.19 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35667</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP EasyCart.This issue affects WP EasyCart: from n/a through 5.5.19.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37161 | MeterSphere front-end editor stores XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37161</link><description>MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform.
