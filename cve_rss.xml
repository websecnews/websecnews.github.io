The function uses user-supplied input `req['llm_factory']` and `req['llm_name']` to dynamically instantiate classes from various model dictionaries. This approach allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code due to the lack of comprehensive input validation or sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious value for 'llm_factory' that, when used as an index to these model dictionaries, results in the execution of arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 04:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-25218 | Photo Gallery Slideshow &amp;amp; Masonry Tiled Gallery &amp;lt;= 1.0.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-25218</link><description>The Photo Gallery Slideshow &amp; Masonry Tiled Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
