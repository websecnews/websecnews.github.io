In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `sqrt` builtin can result in double eval vulnerability when the argument has side-effects. It can be seen that the `build_IR` function of the `sqrt` builtin doesn't cache the argument to the stack. As such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack). No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 18:20:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32648 | vyper default functions don&amp;#x27;t respect nonreentrancy keys</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32648</link><description>Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.0, default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys and the lock isn't emitted. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is low.

In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `create_from_blueprint` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when `raw_args=True` and the `args` argument has side-effects. It can be seen that the `_build_create_IR` function of the `create_from_blueprint` builtin doesn't cache the mentioned `args` argument to the stack. As such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack). No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low.

In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `&lt;address&gt;.code` and either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions `&lt;0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:37:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32645 | vyper performs incorrect topic logging in raw_log</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32645</link><description>Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.13.0 and prior, incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics. A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The `build_IR` function of the `RawLog` class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics. As of time of publication, no fixed version is available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:27:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32481 | vyper&amp;#x27;s range(start, start + N) reverts for negative numbers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32481</link><description>Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 17:09:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32467 | Meteraphsere vulnerable to unauthorized viewing by workspace members</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32467</link><description>MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform.

A vulnerability that only affects GLPI-Agent installed on windows via MSI packaging can allow a local user to cause denial of agent service by replacing GLPI server url with a wrong url or disabling the service. Additionally, in the case the Deploy task is installed, a local malicious user can trigger privilege escalation configuring a malicious server providing its own deploy task payload. GLPI-Agent 1.7.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, edit GLPI-Agent related key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` and add `SystemComponent` DWORD value setting it to `1` to hide GLPI-Agent from installed applications.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:42:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1657 | Ansible automation platform: insecure websocket used when interacting with eda server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1657</link><description>A flaw was found in the ansible automation platform.

Due to security checks for some JAX-RS endpoints being performed after serialization, more processing resources are consumed while the HTTP request is checked. In certain configurations, if an attacker has knowledge of any POST, PUT, or PATCH request paths, they can potentially identify vulnerable endpoints and trigger excessive resource usage as the endpoints process the requests. This can result in a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:42:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25624 | iris-web vulnerable to Server Side Template Injection in reports</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25624</link><description>Iris is a web collaborative platform aiming to help incident responders sharing technical details during investigations. Due to an improper setup of Jinja2 environment, reports generation in `iris-web` is prone to a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI). Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to an arbitrary Remote Code Execution. An authenticated administrator has to upload a crafted report template containing the payload. Upon generation of a report based on the weaponized report, any user can trigger the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is patched in IRIS v2.4.6. No workaround is available. It is recommended to update as soon as possible. Until patching, review the report templates and keep the administrative privileges that include the upload of report templates limited to dedicated users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:42:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31574 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in TWCMS v.2.6 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31574</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in TWCMS v.2.6 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:42:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0874 | Coredns: cd bit response is cached and served later</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0874</link><description>A flaw was found in coredns.

a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 06:37:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2907 | AGCA â Custom Dashboard &amp;amp; Login Page &amp;lt; 7.2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Image URL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2907</link><description>The AGCA  WordPress plugin before 7.2.2 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 05:19:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4161 | Syslog traffic sent in clear-text</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4161</link><description>In Brocade SANnav, before Brocade SANnav v2.3.0, syslog traffic received

binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()

Commit 6d98eb95b450 ("binder: avoid potential data leakage when copying
txn") introduced changes to how binder objects are copied. In doing so,
it unintentionally removed an offset alignment check done through calls
to binder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -&gt; check_buffer().

These calls were replaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(),
so now an explicit offset alignment check is needed here. This avoids
later complications when unwinding the objects gets harder.

It is worth noting this check existed prior to commit 7a67a39320df
("binder: add function to copy binder object from buffer"), likely
removed due to redundancy at the time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:33:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23527 | An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in WLAvalancheService component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3, in certain conditions can allow an una...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23527</link><description>An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in WLAvalancheService component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3, in certain conditions can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read sensitive information in memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:23:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29205 | An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti P...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29205</link><description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests in-order-to cause service disruptions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:23:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26923 | af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26923</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()

Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo getting
enqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that
carries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see a
different set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight
count, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.

sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM
S is an unconnected socket
L is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtable
V's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumped

connect(S, addr)	sendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)	__unix_gc()
----------------	-------------------------	-----------

NS = unix_create1()
skb1 = sock_wmalloc(NS)
L = unix_find_other(addr)
unix_state_lock(L)
unix_peer(S) = NS
			// V count=1 inflight=0

 			NS = unix_peer(S)
 			skb2 = sock_alloc()
			skb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V])

			// V became in-flight
			// V count=2 inflight=1

			close(V)

			// V count=1 inflight=1
			// GC candidate condition met

						for u in gc_inflight_list:
						  if (total_refs == inflight_refs)
						    add u to gc_candidates

						// gc_candidates={L, V}

						for u in gc_candidates:
						  scan_children(u, dec_inflight)

						// embryo (skb1) was not
						// reachable from L yet, so V's
						// inflight remains unchanged
__skb_queue_tail(L, skb1)
unix_state_unlock(L)
						for u in gc_candidates:
						  if (u.inflight)
						    scan_children(u, inc_inflight_move_tail)

						// V count=1 inflight=2 (!)

If there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This
makes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After
flipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if
there is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At
this point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already
taken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:55:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26924 | netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26924</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element

Pablo reports a crash with large batches of elements with a
back-to-back add/remove pattern.  Quoting Pablo:

  add_elem("00000000") timeout 100 ms
  ...
  add_elem("0000000X") timeout 100 ms
  del_elem("0000000X") &lt;---------------- delete one that was just added
  ...
  add_elem("00005000") timeout 100 ms

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove
function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent
element.

nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex to load

It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS.

The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges.

All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 19:16:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4125 | Tenda W15E setStaticRoute formSetStaticRoute stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4125</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Tenda W15E 15.11.0.14 and classified as critical.
