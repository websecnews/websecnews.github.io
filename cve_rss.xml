This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’ endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:20:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0471 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in PMB platform</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0471</link><description>Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the PMB platform, affecting versions 4.0.10 and above.

When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:36:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0480 | wuzhicms config.php test server-side request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0480</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0.

An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52783 | Insecure permissions in the XNetSocketClient component of XINJE XDPPro.exe v3.2.2 to v3.7.17c allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52783</link><description>Insecure permissions in the XNetSocketClient component of XINJE XDPPro.exe v3.2.2 to v3.7.17c allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via modification of the configuration file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:11:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50953 | An issue in XINJE XL5E-16T V3.7.2a allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted Modbus message.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50953</link><description>An issue in XINJE XL5E-16T V3.7.2a allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted Modbus message.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57011 | TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "minute" parameters in setSc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57011</link><description>TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "minute" parameters in setScheduleCfg.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57012 | TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "week" parameter in setSched...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57012</link><description>TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "week" parameter in setScheduleCfg.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57013 | TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "switch" parameter in setSch...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57013</link><description>TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "switch" parameter in setScheduleCfg.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57014 | TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "recHour" parameter in setSc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57014</link><description>TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "recHour" parameter in setScheduleCfg.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57015 | TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "hour" parameter in setSched...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57015</link><description>TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2350_B20230313 was discovered to contain an OS command injection vulnerability via the "hour" parameter in setScheduleCfg.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50954 | The XINJE XL5E-16T and XD5E-24R-E programmable logic controllers V3.5.3b-V3.7.2a have a vulnerability in handling Modbus messages.

RDMA/rtrs: Ensure 'ib_sge list' is accessible

Move the declaration of the 'ib_sge list' variable outside the
'always_invalidate' block to ensure it remains accessible for use
throughout the function.

Previously, 'ib_sge list' was declared within the 'always_invalidate'
block, limiting its accessibility, then caused a
'BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference'[1].

net/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag

During driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading
vport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get
rpriv-&gt;netdev, or walk rpriv-&gt;tc_ht, which results in use-after-free.
So add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is
still loaded.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57802 | netrom: check buffer length before accessing it</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57802</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue occurs because the skb buffer is too small, and it's actual
allocation is aligned. This hides an actual issue, which is that nr_route_frame
does not validate the buffer size before using it.

Fix this issue by checking skb-&gt;len before accessing any fields in skb-&gt;data.

Eric noted a probable shinfo-&gt;nr_frags corruption, which indeed
occurs.

The root cause is a buggy MPTCP option len computation in some
circumstances: the ADD_ADDR option should be mutually exclusive
with DSS since the blamed commit.

Still, mptcp_established_options_add_addr() tries to set the

mm: hugetlb: independent PMD page table shared count

The folio refcount may be increased unexpectly through try_get_folio() by
caller such as split_huge_pages.  In huge_pmd_unshare(), we use refcount
to check whether a pmd page table is shared.  The check is incorrect if
the refcount is increased by the above caller, and this can cause the page
table leaked:

The issue may be triggered by damon, offline_page, page_idle, etc, which
will increase the refcount of page table.

1. The page table itself will be discarded after reporting the
   "nonzero mapcount".

2. The HugeTLB page mapped by the page table miss freeing since we
   treat the page table as shared and a shared page table will not be
   unmapped.

Fix it by introducing independent PMD page table shared count.  As
described by comment, pt_index/pt_mm/pt_frag_refcount are used for s390
gmap, x86 pgds and powerpc, pt_share_count is used for x86/arm64/riscv
pmds, so we can reuse the field as pt_share_count.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57884 | mm: vmscan: account for free pages to prevent infinite Loop in throttle_direct_reclaim()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57884</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In allow_direct_reclaim(), while processing ZONE_DMA32, the sum of
inactive/active file-backed pages calculated in zone_reclaimable_pages()
based on the result of zone_page_state_snapshot() is zero.  

Additionally, since this system lacks swap, the calculation of inactive/
active anonymous pages is skipped.

        crash&gt; p nr_swap_pages
        nr_swap_pages = $1937 = {
          counter = 0
        }

As a result, ZONE_DMA32 is deemed unreclaimable and skipped, moving on to
the processing of the next zone, ZONE_NORMAL, despite ZONE_DMA32 having
free pages significantly exceeding the high watermark.

The problem is that the pgdat-&gt;kswapd_failures hasn't been incremented.

        crash&gt; px ((struct pglist_data *) 0xffff00817fffe540)-&gt;kswapd_failures
        $1935 = 0x0

This is because the node deemed balanced.  The node balancing logic in
balance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively.  If one or more zones
(e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, the
entire node is deemed balanced.  This causes balance_pgdat() to exit early
before incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overall
memory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remain
under significant pressure.


The patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages
(NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages are
available (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages).  This change prevents
zones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from being
mistakenly deemed unreclaimable.  By doing so, the patch ensures proper
node balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,
and prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused by
allow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.


The kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), caused
by a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certain
zones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.  This issue arises from
zone_reclaimable_pages

%pS and %pK, in the same back trace line, are redundant, and %pS can void
%pK service in certain contexts.

%pS alone already provides the necessary information, and if it cannot
resolve the symbol, it falls back to printing the raw address voiding
the original intent behind the %pK.

Additionally, %pK requires a privilege check CAP_SYSLOG enforced through
the LSM, which can trigger a "sleeping function called from invalid
context" warning under RT_PREEMPT kernels when the check occurs in an
atomic context. This issue may also affect other LSMs.

This change avoids the unnecessary privilege check and resolves the
sleeping function warning without any loss of information.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57886 | mm/damon/core: fix new damon_target objects leaks on damon_commit_targets()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57886</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/core: fix new damon_target objects leaks on damon_commit_targets()

Patch series "mm/damon/core: fix memory leaks and ignored inputs from
damon_commit_ctx()".

Due to two bugs in damon_commit_targets() and damon_commit_schemes(),
which are called from damon_commit_ctx(), some user inputs can be ignored,
and some mmeory objects can be leaked.  Fix those.

Note that only DAMON sysfs interface users are affected.  Other DAMON core
API user modules that more focused more on simple and dedicated production
usages, including DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_LRU_SORT are not using the buggy
function in the way, so not affected.


This patch (of 2):

When new DAMON targets are added via damon_commit_targets(), the newly
created targets are not deallocated when updating the internal data
(damon_commit_target()) is failed.  Worse yet, even if the setup is
successfully done, the new target is not linked to the context.  Hence,
the new targets are always leaked regardless of the internal data setup
failure.  Fix the leaks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57887 | drm: adv7511: Fix use-after-free in adv7533_attach_dsi()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57887</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

pinctrl: mcp23s08: Fix sleeping in atomic context due to regmap locking

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context

We observed the problem while experimenting with a touchscreen driver which
used MCP23017 IO expander (I2C).

The regmap in the pinctrl-mcp23s08 driver uses a mutex for protection from
concurrent accesses, which is the default for regmaps without .fast_io,
.disable_locking, etc.

mcp23s08_irq_set_type() calls regmap_update_bits_base(), and the latter
locks the mutex.

However, __setup_irq() locks desc-&gt;lock spinlock before calling these
functions. As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding
the spinlock.

It seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.
mcp-&gt;lock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,
except, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.

mcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under
chip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes
mcp-&gt;lock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C
accesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().

The accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional
locking.

In all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except
mcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp-&gt;lock.

This patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal
locking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping
in atomic context described above.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57890 | RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57890</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue

In the expression "cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count", both variables are u32
values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer
wrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also
could potentially wrap.  The "cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)"
multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on
64bit systems.

This patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in
uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable "len" is on
one side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified
all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57891 | sched_ext: Fix invalid irq restore in scx_ops_bypass()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57891</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv

When mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a
slab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to
quota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)-&gt;dqi_priv is the
dangling pointer.

During the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never
set as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option
for remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the
DQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the
next quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the
quota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.

To fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with
read-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.

ALSA: seq: oss: Fix races at processing SysEx messages

OSS sequencer handles the SysEx messages split in 6 bytes packets, and
ALSA sequencer OSS layer tries to combine those.  It stores the data
in the internal buffer and this access is racy as of now, which may
lead to the out-of-bounds access.

As a temporary band-aid fix, introduce a mutex for serializing the
process of the SysEx message packets.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57894 | Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix sleeping function called from invalid context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57894</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: flush delalloc workers queue before stopping cleaner kthread during unmount

During the unmount path, at close_ctree(), we first stop the cleaner
kthread, using kthread_stop() which frees the associated task_struct, and
then stop and destroy all the work queues. However after we stopped the
cleaner we may still have a worker from the delalloc_workers queue running
inode.c:submit_compressed_extents(), which calls btrfs_add_delayed_iput(),
which in turn tries to wake up the cleaner kthread - which was already
destroyed before, resulting in a use-after-free on the task_struct.

Syzbot reported this with the following stack traces:

drm/amdkfd: Correct the migration DMA map direction

The SVM DMA device map direction should be set the same as
the DMA unmap setting, otherwise the DMA core will report
the following warning.

Before finialize this solution, there're some discussion on
the DMA mapping type(stream-based or coherent) in this KFD
migration case, followed by https://lore.kernel.org/all/04d4ab32
-45a1-4b88-86ee-fb0f35a0ca40@amd.com/T/.

As there's no dma_sync_single_for_*() in the DMA buffer accessed
that because this migration operation should be sync properly and
automatically. Give that there's might not be a performance problem
in various cache sync policy of DMA sync. Therefore, in order to
simplify the DMA direction setting alignment, let's set the DMA map
direction as BIDIRECTIONAL.

wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up

Currently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the
valid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some
functions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One
such example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -

nl80211_remove_link()
    cfg80211_remove_link()
        ieee80211_del_intf_link()
            ieee80211_vif_set_links()
                ieee80211_vif_update_links()
                    ieee80211_link_stop()
                        cfg80211_cac_event()

cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared
already in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.

Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link
clean-up.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57899 | wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systems</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57899</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systems

On 32-bit systems, the size of an unsigned long is 4 bytes,
while a u64 is 8 bytes. Therefore, when using
or_each_set_bit(bit, &amp;amp;bits, sizeof(changed) * BITS_PER_BYTE),
the code is incorrectly searching for a bit in a 32-bit
variable that is expected to be 64 bits in size,
leading to incorrect bit finding.

Solution: Ensure that the size of the bits variable is correctly
adjusted for each architecture.

ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()

syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]

commit 031ae72825ce ("ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner")
attempted to fix a similar issue.

Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.

Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().

BIG TCP introduced an IPV6_TLV_JUMBO IPv6 extension header to
communicate packet length, as this is an IPv6 jumbogram. But, the
feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The
header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not
transmitted by physical devices.

For this specific case of extension headers that are not
transmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit
and support hardware offload.

ipv6_has_hopopt_jumbo() tests not only whether this header is present,
but also that it is the only extension header before a terminal (L4)
header.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21630 | io_uring/net: always initialize kmsg-&amp;gt;msg.msg_inq upfront</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21630</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot reports that -&gt;msg_inq may get used uinitialized from the

and it is correct, as it's never initialized upfront. Hence the first
submission can end up using it uninitialized, if the recv wasn't
successful and the networking stack didn't honor -&gt;msg_get_inq being set
and filling in the output value of -&gt;msg_inq as requested.

Set it to 0 upfront when it's allocated, just to silence this KMSAN
warning. There's no side effect of using it uninitialized, it'll just
potentially cause the next receive to use a recv value hint that's not
accurate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:21:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11029 | Freeipa: administrative user data leaked through systemd journal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11029</link><description>A flaw was found in the FreeIPA API audit, where it sends the whole FreeIPA command line to journalctl.

This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms, and will trigger a preconditionFailure if that constraint isn't met.

Importantly, these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding, which is what the library did.

These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime. The impact of this is that it can be used as a denial-of-service vector when parsing BER/DER data from unknown sources, e.g. when parsing TLS certificates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025

When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials.

A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa that enables an attacker who has the ability to load a maliciously crafted model remotely into a Rasa instance to achieve Remote Code Execution. The prerequisites for this are: 1. The HTTP API must be enabled on the Rasa instance eg with `--enable-api`. This is not the default configuration. 2. For unauthenticated RCE to be exploitable, the user must not have configured any authentication or other security controls recommended in our documentation. 3. For authenticated RCE, the attacker must posses a valid authentication token or JWT to interact with the Rasa API. This issue has been addressed in rasa version 3.6.21 and all users are advised to upgrade.

Gradio's Access Control List (ACL) for file paths can be bypassed by altering the letter case of a blocked file or directory path. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic. On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive files that should be protected. This issue can lead to unauthorized data access, exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradio's security model. Given Gradio's popularity for building web applications, particularly in machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited in production environments. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.6.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:00:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50349 | Git does not sanitize URLs when asking for credentials interactively</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50349</link><description>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already, and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.1, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade.

Git defines a line-based protocol that is used to exchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Some ecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single Carriage Return characters as newlines, which renders the protections against CVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returns in this way. This issue has been addressed in commit `b01b9b8` which is included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.1, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4.

The Git credential protocol is text-based over standard input/output, and consists of a series of lines of key-value pairs in the format `key=value`. Git's documentation restricts the use of the NUL (`\0`) character and newlines to form part of the keys or values. When Git reads from standard input, it considers both LF and CRLF as newline characters for the credential protocol by virtue of calling `strbuf_getline` that calls to `strbuf_getdelim_strip_crlf`. Git also validates that a newline is not present in the value by checking for the presence of the line-feed character (LF, `\n`), and errors if this is the case. This captures both LF and CRLF-type newlines. Git Credential Manager uses the .NET standard library `StreamReader` class to read the standard input stream line-by-line and parse the `key=value` credential protocol format. The implementation of the `ReadLineAsync` method considers LF, CRLF, and CR as valid line endings. This is means that .NET considers a single CR as a valid newline character, whereas Git does not. This mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM means that an attacker can craft a malicious remote URL. When a user clones or otherwise interacts with a malicious repository that requires authentication, the attacker can capture credentials for another Git remote. The attack is also heightened when cloning from repositories with submodules when using the `--recursive` clone option as the user is not able to inspect the submodule remote URLs beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only interact with trusted remote repositories, and not clone with `--recursive` to allow inspection of any submodule URLs before cloning those submodules.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:35:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21171 | .NET Remote Code Execution

rsync</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12087</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:16:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23025 | Privilege escalation (PR) through realtime WYSIWYG editing in XWiki</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23025</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. NOTE: The Realtime WYSIWYG Editor extension was **experimental**, and thus **not recommended**, in the versions affected by this vulnerability. It has become enabled by default, and thus recommended, starting with XWiki 16.9.0. A user with only **edit right** can join a realtime editing session where others, that where already there or that may join later, have **script** or **programming** access rights. This user can then insert **script rendering macros** that are executed for those users in the realtime session that have script or programming rights. The inserted scripts can be used to gain more access rights. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either disable the realtime WYSIWYG editing by disabling the ``xwiki-realtime`` CKEditor plugin from the WYSIWYG editor administration section or uninstall the Realtime WYSIWYG Editorextension (org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-realtime-wysiwyg-ui).</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:49:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12085 | Rsync: info leak via uninitialized stack contents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12085</link><description>A flaw was found in the rsync daemon which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12086 | Rsync: rsync server leaks arbitrary client files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12086</link><description>A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to enumerate the contents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This issue occurs when files are being copied from a client to a server. During this process, the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the client to compare with in order to determine what data needs to be sent to the server. By sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, an attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-byte based on the responses from the client.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12088 | Rsync: --safe-links option bypass leads to path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12088</link><description>A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, rsync fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12747 | Rsync: race condition in rsync handling symbolic links</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12747</link><description>A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23052 | Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability allows Unauthorized Command Execution in CLI Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23052</link><description>Authenticated command injection vulnerability in the command line interface of a network management service.

It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /api/v2/categories. The manipulation of the argument PostBody.populate leads to deserialization. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21607 | Success of Certain Precompile Calls not Checked in Vyper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21607</link><description>Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4), the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules, after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence, only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore, we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. There are no actions for users to take.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:42:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23051 | Authenticated Remote Code Execution in AOS Web-based Management Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23051</link><description>An authenticated parameter injection vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface of the AOS-8 and AOS-10 Operating Systems.
