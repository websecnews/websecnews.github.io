Exploiting this flaw can violate network import security, posing a risk to developers and servers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 01:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34786 | UniFi iOS app 10.15.0 introduces a misconfiguration on 2nd Generation UniFi Access Points configured as standalone (not using UniFi Network ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34786</link><description>UniFi iOS app 10.15.0 introduces a misconfiguration on 2nd Generation UniFi Access Points configured as standalone (not using UniFi Network Application) that could cause the SSID name to change and/or the WiFi Password to be removed on the 5GHz Radio.

The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:48:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28882 | OpenVPN 2.6.10 and earlier in a server role accepts multiple exit notifications from authenticated clients which will extend the validity of...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28882</link><description>OpenVPN 2.6.10 and earlier in a server role accepts multiple exit notifications from authenticated clients which will extend the validity of a closing session</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 21:39:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3653 | Undertow: learningpushhandler can lead to remote memory dos attacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3653</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack.

There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:43:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41251 | A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the boa formRoute functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11.

In line 313 "addr_loaded_cnt" is checked not to be "CHECK_IMAGE_AREA_CNT" (5) or larger, this check does not halt the function. Immediately after (line 317) there will be an overflow in the buffer and the value of "dst" will be written to the area immediately after the buffer, which is "addr_loaded_cnt". This will allow an attacker to freely control the value of "addr_loaded_cnt" and thus control the destination of the write immediately after (line 318). The write in line 318 will then be fully controlled by said attacker, with whichever address and whichever value ("len") they desire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:23:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39677 | NHibernate SQL injection vulnerability in discriminator mappings, static fields referenced in HQL, and some utilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39677</link><description>NHibernate is an object-relational mapper for the .NET framework.
