This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the RMI interface, which listens on TCP port 41009 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.

usb: misc: ljca: Fix double free in error handling path

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function ljca_auxdev_release
calls kfree(auxdev-&gt;dev.platform_data) to free the parameter data
of the function ljca_new_client_device. The callers of
ljca_new_client_device shouldn't call kfree() again
in the error handling path to free the platform data.

Fix this by cleaning up the redundant kfree() in all callers and
adding kfree() the passed in platform_data on errors which happen
before auxiliary_device_init() succeeds .</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 08:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26654 | ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26654</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard-&gt;timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard-&gt;timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
 ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                 |    mod_timer()
  flush_work()                   |
  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
  kfree(dreamcastcard-&gt;channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker
  ...                            |    dreamcastcard-&gt;channel-&gt; //USE

In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 08:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2016-15038 | NUUO NVRmini 2 deletefile.php path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-15038</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in NUUO NVRmini 2 up to 3.0.8.

So what I just did is :
- First removed the cors configuration that allows everyone to access it :
before:
```python
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins="*", ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for every one
```
after:
```python
    cert_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"cert.pem"
    key_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"key.pem"
    if os.path.exists(cert_file_path) and os.path.exists(key_file_path):
        is_https = True
    else:
        is_https = False        

    # Create a Socket.IO server
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins=config.allowed_origins+[f"https://localhost:{config['port']}" if is_https else f"http://localhost:{config['port']}"], ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for selected origins
```

- Second, I have updated lollms to have two modes (a headless mode and a ui mode).
And updated the /execute_code to block if the server is headless or is exposed
```python
@router.post("/execute_code")
async def execute_code(request: Request):
    """
    Executes Python code and returns the output.

    :param request: The HTTP request object.
    :return: A JSON response with the status of the operation.
    """
    if lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode:
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when in headless mode for obvious security reasons!"}

    if lollmsElfServer.config.host=="0.0.0.0":
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when the server is exposed outside for very obvipous reasons!"}

    try:
        data = (await request.json())
        code = data["code"]
        discussion_id = int(data.get("discussion_id","unknown_discussion"))
        message_id = int(data.get("message_id","unknown_message"))
        language = data.get("language","python")
        


        if language=="python":
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing python code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_python(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        if language=="javascript":

            return execute_mermaid(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        elif language in ["graphviz","dot"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing graphviz code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_graphviz(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        return {"status": False, "error": "Unsupported language", "execution_time": 0}
    except Exception as ex:
        trace_exception(ex)
        lollmsElfServer.error(ex)
        return {"status":False,"error":str(ex)}
```

I also added an optional https mode and looking forward to add a full authentication with cookies and a personal session etc.


All updates will be in V 9.1 


Again, thanks alot for your work. I will make it harder next time, but if you find more bugs, just be my guest :)</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 18:13:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3091 | PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal Search Request Page search.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3091</link><description>A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal 1.0.
