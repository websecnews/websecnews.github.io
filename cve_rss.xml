A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage: 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 21:37:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53859 | go-gh `auth.TokenForHost` violates GitHub host security boundary within a codespace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53859</link><description>go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved: 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 21:37:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53860 | Potential Abuse for Sending Arbitrary Emails in sp-php-email-handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53860</link><description>sp-php-email-handler is a PHP package for handling contact form submissions.

The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41125 | Out-of-bounds read in SNMP when decoding a string in Contiki-NG</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41125</link><description>Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41126 | Out-of-bounds read when decoding SNMP messages in Contiki-NG</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41126</link><description>Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices.

An unaligned memory access can be triggered in the two RPL implementations of the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem can occur when either one of these RPL implementations is enabled and connected to an RPL instance. If an IPv6 packet containing an odd number of padded bytes before the RPL option, it can cause the rpl_ext_header_hbh_update function to read a 16-bit integer from an odd address. The impact of this unaligned read is architecture-dependent, but can potentially cause the system to crash. The problem has not been patched as of release 4.9, but will be included in the next release. One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2962 to patch the system or wait for the next release.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:40:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53264 | Open Redirect Vulnerability in Loading Page in bunkerweb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53264</link><description>bunkerweb is an Open-source and next-generation Web Application Firewall (WAF).

When it does that restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the pod request. As a result, the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies are not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesn't have access to host mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the restore endpoint and trigger the restore.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 19:25:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52008 | Password Policy Bypass Vulnerability in Fides Webserver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52008</link><description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.50.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:59:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53619 | An authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Documents module of SPIP v4.3.3 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via u...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53619</link><description>An authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Documents module of SPIP v4.3.3 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted PDF file.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:59:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53620 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Article module of SPIP v4.3.3 allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web scri...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53620</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Article module of SPIP v4.3.3 allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via injecting a crafted payload into the Title parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:59:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11669 | Incorrect Authorization in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11669</link><description>An issue was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 16.9.8 before 17.4.5, 17.5 before 17.5.3, and 17.6 before 17.6.1.

This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry, cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question, thereby "verifying" a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality. This issue has been patched in v1.1.0 release with PR #856. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:52:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53844 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (&amp;#x27;Path Traversal&amp;#x27;) in labsai/eddi</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53844</link><description>E.D.D.I (Enhanced Dialog Driven Interface) is a middleware to connect and manage LLM API bots. A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI, as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input, enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However, the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container**, which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result, while this vulnerability exposes files within the container, it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch. For temporary mitigation, access to the vulnerable endpoint should be restricted through firewall rules or authentication mechanisms.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:52:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11668 | Insufficient Session Expiration in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11668</link><description>An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 16.11 before 17.4.5, 17.5 before 17.5.3, and 17.6 before 17.6.1.

This allows an attacker to inject attributes that are used in other components, or to override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.


The main use case of Convict is for handling server-side 
configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random 
users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their 
own server. Still, a situation can happen where an admin not 
knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into 
writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.



This issue affects Convict: before 6.2.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:41:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-2142 | Nunjucks autoescape bypass leads to cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2142</link><description>In Nunjucks versions prior to version 3.2.4, it was
