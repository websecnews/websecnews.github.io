A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the RODEX functionality of rAthena's map-server in versions prior to commit af2f3ba. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a specific attacking scenario to cause a denial of service by crashing the map-server. This issue has been patched in commit af2f3ba. There are no known workarounds aside from manually applying the patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:58:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61775 | Vicekey&amp;#x27;s unexpired email confirmation link can be reused to send repeated confirmation emails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61775</link><description>Vickey is a Misskey-based microblogging platform. A vulnerability exists in Vickey prior to version 2025.10.0 where unexpired email confirmation links can be reused multiple times to send repeated confirmation emails to a verified email address. Under certain conditions, a verified email address could receive repeated confirmation messages if the verification link was accessed multiple times. This issue may result in unintended email traffic but does not expose user data. The issue was addressed in version 2025.10.0 by improving validation logic to ensure verification links behave as expected after completion.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:40:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62243 | Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Publications in Liferay Portal 7.4.1 through 7.4.3.112, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62243</link><description>Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Publications in Liferay Portal 7.4.1 through 7.4.3.112, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.5, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.8, and 7.4 GA through update 92 allows remote authenticated attackers to view publication comments via the _com_liferay_change_tracking_web_portlet_PublicationsPortlet_value parameter.

This configuration allows local users to overwrite, delete, or corrupt NLTK data files, leading to potential denial of service, data tampering, or privilege escalation. The vulnerability arises from the use of a shared cache directory instead of a user-specific one, making it susceptible to local data tampering and denial of service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:41:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43991 | SupportAssist for Home PCs versions 4.8.2 and prior and SupportAssist for Business PCs versions 4.5.3 and prior, contain an UNIX Symbolic Li...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43991</link><description>SupportAssist for Home PCs versions 4.8.2 and prior and SupportAssist for Business PCs versions 4.5.3 and prior, contain an UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) following vulnerability.

crypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg

Issuing two writes to the same af_alg socket is bogus as the
data will be interleaved in an unpredictable fashion.  Furthermore,
concurrent writes may create inconsistencies in the internal
socket state.

Disallow this by adding a new ctx-&gt;write field that indiciates
exclusive ownership for writing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:10:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39965 | xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn&amp;#x27;t use 0 as SPI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39965</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn't use 0 as SPI

x-&gt;id.spi == 0 means "no SPI assigned", but since commit
94f39804d891 ("xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling"), we now create states
and add them to the byspi list with this value.

__xfrm_state_delete doesn't remove those states from the byspi list,
since they shouldn't be there, and this shows up as a UAF the next
time we go through the byspi list.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:10:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37729 | Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37729</link><description>Improper neutralization of special elements used in a template engine in Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) can lead to a malicious actor with Admin access exfiltrating sensitive information and issuing commands via a specially crafted string where Jinjava variables are evaluated.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:53:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9902 | IDOR in AkÄ±nsoft QRMenu</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9902</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in AKIN Software Computer Import Export Industry and Trade Co.
