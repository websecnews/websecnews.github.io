This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note that changing a WordPress user's password is only possible if the "Use WordPress users as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. Without this setting enabled, only the passwords of plugin customers, which are stored and managed in a separate database table, can be modified.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 08:47:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8943 | LatePoint &amp;lt;= 5.0.12 - Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8943</link><description>The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including,  5.0.12. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during the booking customer step. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. Note that logging in as a WordPress user is only possible if the "Use WordPress users as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 5.0.12 and fully patched in version 5.0.13.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 08:47:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47095 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Follet School Solutions Destiny</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47095</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Follet School Solutions Destiny before v22.0.1 AU1 allows a remote attacker to run arbitrary client-side code via the expiredSupportMessage parameter of handleloginform.do.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 08:01:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8964 | Image Optimizer, Resizer and CDN – Sirv &amp;lt;= 7.2.9 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8964</link><description>The Image Optimizer, Resizer and CDN – Sirv plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

One of the sample scripts in PhpSpreadsheet is susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of input where a number is expected leading to formula injection. The code in in `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php` concatenates the user supplied parameters directly into spreadsheet formulas. This allows an attacker to take control over the formula and output unsanitized data into the page, resulting in JavaScript execution. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 20:33:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45290 | Path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery when opening XLSX files in PHPSpreadsheet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45290</link><description>PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. It's possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file which links media from external URLs. When opening the XLSX file, PhpSpreadsheet retrieves the image size and type by reading the file contents, if the provided path is a URL. By using specially crafted `php://filter` URLs an attacker can leak the contents of any file or URL. Note that this vulnerability is different from GHSA-w9xv-qf98-ccq4, and resides in a different component. An attacker can access any file on the server, or leak information form arbitrary URLs, potentially exposing sensitive information such as AWS IAM credentials. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 20:33:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45291 | Path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery in HTML writer when embedding images is enabled in PHPSpreadsheet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45291</link><description>PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. It's possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file that links images from arbitrary paths. When embedding images has been enabled in HTML writer with `$writer-&gt;setEmbedImages(true);` those files will be included in the output as `data:` URLs, regardless of the file's type. Also URLs can be used for embedding, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. When embedding images has been enabled, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server and perform arbitrary HTTP GET requests. Note that any PHP protocol wrappers can be used, meaning that if for example the `expect://` wrapper is enabled, also remote code execution is possible. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0.

The security scanner responsible for preventing XXE attacks in the XLSX reader can be bypassed by slightly modifying the XML structure, utilizing white-spaces. On servers that allow users to upload their own Excel (XLSX) sheets, Server files and sensitive information can be disclosed by providing a crafted sheet. The security scan function in src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php contains a flawed XML encoding check to retrieve the input file's XML encoding in the toUtf8 function. The function searches for the XML encoding through a defined regex which looks for `encoding="*"` and/or `encoding='*'`, if not found, it defaults to the UTF-8 encoding which bypasses the conversion logic. This logic can be used to pass a UTF-7 encoded XXE payload, by utilizing a whitespace before or after the = in the attribute definition. Sensitive information disclosure through the XXE on sites that allow users to upload their own excel spreadsheets, and parse them using PHPSpreadsheet's Excel parser. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.1, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade.
