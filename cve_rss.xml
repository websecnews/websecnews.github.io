By crafting a malicious repository and environment, an attacker could replace system binaries during hook cleanup and execute a payload that adds their own SSH key to the root user’s authorized keys—thereby granting themselves root SSH access to the server. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needed to have enterprise admin privileges. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.19, and was fixed in versions 3.14.19, 3.15.14, 3.16.10, 3.17.7 and 3.18.1.

In versions prior to 1.45.2, users who use the exclusion operator somewhere in their authorization schema; have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` is bigger than 6500; and issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows; will receive a successful response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed, and receive incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation involving the exclusion. Version 1.45.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, set `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` to `1000`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:42:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64519 | TorrentPier is Vulnerable to Authenticated SQL Injection through Moderator Control Panel&amp;#x27;s topic_id parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64519</link><description>TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In versions up to and including 2.8.8, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the moderator control panel (`modcp.php`). Users with moderator permissions can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious `topic_id` (`t`) parameter. This allows an authenticated moderator to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to the potential disclosure, modification, or deletion of any data in the database. Although it requires moderator privileges, it is still severe. A malicious or compromised moderator account can leverage this vulnerability to read, modify, or delete data. A patch is available at commit 6a0f6499d89fa5d6e2afa8ee53802a1ad11ece80.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64522 | Soft Serve is vulnerable to SSRF through its Webhooks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64522</link><description>Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line.

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5 to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component, gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster. This grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations such as database or collection management. This issue has been fixed in Milvus 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5. If immediate upgrade is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach the Milvus Proxy. This prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64518 | CycloneDX Core (Java): BOM validation is vulnerable to XML External Entity injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64518</link><description>The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 11.0.1, the XML `Validator` used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8 / CVE-2024-38374 was incomplete in that it only fixed parsing of XML BOMs, but not validation. The vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1. As a workaround, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to cyclonedx-core-java for validation. This may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64507 | Incus vulnerable to local privilege escalation through custom storage volumes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64507</link><description>Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. An issue in versions prior to 6.0.6 and 6.19.0 affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user. The most common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can be executed as an unprivileged user on the host to gain root privileges. A patch for this issue is expected in versions 6.0.6 and 6.19.0. As a workaround, permissions can be manually restricted until a patched version of Incus is deployed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64512 | pdfminer.six vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Crafted PDF Input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64512</link><description>Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64504 | Langfuse vulnerable to cross‑organization enumeration of member &amp;amp; invitation lists via project membership APIs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64504</link><description>Langfuse is an open source large language model engineering platform. Starting in version 2.70.0 and prior to versions 2.95.11 and 3.124.1, in certain project membership APIs, the server trusted a user‑controlled orgId and used it in authorization checks. As a result, any authenticated user on the same Langfuse instance could enumerate names and email addresses of users in another organization if they knew the target organization’s ID. Disclosure is limited to names and email addresses of members/invitees. No customer data such as traces, prompts, or evaluations is exposed or accessible. For Langfuse Cloud, the maintainers ran a thorough investigation of access logs of the last 30 days and could not find any evidence that this vulnerability was exploited. For most self-hosting deployments, the attack surface is significantly reduced given an SSO provider is configured and email/password sign-up is disabled. In these cases, only users who authenticate via the Enterprise SSO IdP (e.g. Okta) would be able to exploit this vulnerability to access the member list, i.e. internal users getting access to a list of other internal users. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the actor must have a valid Langfuse user account within the same instance, know the target orgId, and use the request made to the API that powers the frontend membership tables, including their project/user authentication token, while changing the orgId to the target organization. Langfuse Cloud (EU, US, HIPAA) were affected until fix deployment on November 1, 2025. The maintainers reviewed the Langfuse Cloud access logs from the past 30 days and found no evidence that this vulnerability was exploited. Self-Hosted versions which contain patches include v2.95.11 for major version 2 and v3.124.1 for major version 3. There are no known workarounds. Upgrading is required to fully mitigate this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:59:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64508 | Bugsink vulnerable to unauthenticated remote DoS via crafted Brotli input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64508</link><description>Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.5, brotli "bombs" (highly compressed brotli streams, such as many zeros) can be sent to the server. Since the server will attempt to decompress these streams before applying various maximums, this can lead to exhaustion of the available memory and thus a Denial of Service. This can be done if the `DSN` is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps). The issue is patched in Bugsink version `2.0.5`. The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink, GHSA-rrx3-2x4g-mq2h/CVE-2025-64509.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:51:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64509 | Bugsink vulnerable to unauthenticated remote DoS via crafted Brotli input (via CPU)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64509</link><description>Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool.

In versions 0.2.0 and below, the `prosemirror_to_html` gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious HTML attribute values. While tag content is properly escaped, attribute values are not, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. Applications that use `prosemirror_to_html` to convert ProseMirror documents to HTML, user-generated ProseMirror content, and end users viewing the rendered HTML output are all at risk of attack. This issue is fixed in version 0.2.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:51:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64502 | Parse Server allows public `explain` queries which may expose sensitive database performance information and schema details</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64502</link><description>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. The MongoDB `explain()` method provides detailed information about query execution plans, including index usage, collection scanning behavior, and performance metrics. Prior to version 8.5.0-alpha.5, Parse Server permits any client to execute explain queries without requiring the master key. This exposes database schema structure and field names, index configurations and query optimization details, query execution statistics and performance metrics, and potential attack vectors for database performance exploitation. In version 8.5.0-alpha.5, a new `databaseOptions.allowPublicExplain` configuration option has been introduced that allows to restrict `explain` queries to the master key. The option defaults to `true` for now to avoid a breaking change in production systems that depends on public `explain` availability. In addition, a security warning is logged when the option is not explicitly set, or set to `true`. In a future major release of Parse Server, the default will change to `false`. As a workaround, implement middleware to block explain queries from non-master-key requests, or monitor and alert on explain query usage in production environments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:51:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64182 | OpenEXR has buffer overflow in PyOpenEXR_old&amp;#x27;s channels() and channel()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64182</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4, 3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2, a memory safety bug in the legacy OpenEXR Python adapter (the deprecated OpenEXR.InputFile wrapper) allow crashes and likely code execution when opening attacker-controlled EXR files or when passing crafted Python objects. Integer overflow and unchecked allocation in InputFile.channel() and InputFile.channels() can lead to heap overflow (32 bit) or a NULL deref (64 bit). Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 contain a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:42:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64183 | OpenEXR has use after free in PyObject_StealAttrString</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64183</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4, 3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2, there is a use-after-free in PyObject_StealAttrString of pyOpenEXR_old.cpp. The legacy adapter defines PyObject_StealAttrString that calls PyObject_GetAttrString to obtain a new reference, immediately decrefs it, and returns the pointer. Callers then pass this dangling pointer to APIs like PyLong_AsLong/PyFloat_AsDouble, resulting in a use-after-free. This is invoked in multiple places (e.g., reading PixelType.v, Box2i, V2f, etc.) Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:42:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64484 | OAuth2-Proxy vulnerable to header smuggling via underscore, leading to potential privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64484</link><description>OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0, all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic, potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized, meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example, both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it, the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround, ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:42:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62780 | changedetection.io vulnerable to stored XSS in Watch update via API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62780</link><description>changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. A Stored Cross Site Scripting is present in changedetection.io Watch update API in versions prior to 0.50.34 due to insufficient security checks. Two scenarios are possible. In the first, an attacker can insert a new watch with an arbitrary URL which really points to a web page. Once the HTML content is retrieved, the attacker updates the URL with a JavaScript payload. In the second, an attacker substitutes the URL in an existing watch with a new URL that is in reality a JavaScript payload. When the user clicks on *Preview* and then on the malicious link, the JavaScript malicious code is executed. Version 0.50.34 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:29:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64181 | OpenEXR Makes Use of Uninitialized Memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64181</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry.
