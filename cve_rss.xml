This is due to the `BaseModel` class constructor calling `maybe_unserialize()` on all properties retrieved from the database without validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object by submitting a double-serialized payload through any public-facing form that sends email (e.g., Contact Form 7). When the email is logged and subsequently viewed by an administrator, the malicious payload is deserialized into an arbitrary PHP object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 06:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1542 | Super Stage WP &amp;lt;= 1.0.1 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1542</link><description>The Super Stage WP WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 unserializes user input via REQUEST, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present on the blog.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 06:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28426 | Statamic vulnerable to privilege escalation via stored cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28426</link><description>Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS).

Prior to versions 5.73.11 and 6.4.0, an authenticated control panel user with access to Antlers-enabled inputs may be able to achieve remote code execution in the application context. That can lead to full compromise of the application, including access to sensitive configuration, modification or exfiltration of data, and potential impact on availability. Exploitation is only possible where Antlers runs on user-controlled content—for example, content fields with Antlers explicitly enabled (requiring permission to configure fields and to edit entries), built-in config that supports Antlers such as Forms email notification settings (requiring configuration permission), or third-party addons that add Antlers-enabled fields to entries (for example, the SEO Pro addon). In each case the attacker must have the relevant control panel permissions. This has been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0. Users of addons that depend on Statamic should ensure that after updating they are running a patched Statamic version.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 22:46:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28515 | openDCIM &amp;lt;= 23.04 Missing Authorization in install.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28515</link><description>openDCIM version 23.04, through commit 4467e9c4, contains a missing authorization vulnerability in install.php and container-install.php.

Prior to version 6.6.0, the _redirect_to_target() function in Gradio's OAuth flow accepts an unvalidated _target_url query parameter, allowing redirection to arbitrary external URLs. This affects the /logout and /login/callback endpoints on Gradio apps with OAuth enabled (i.e. apps running on Hugging Face Spaces with gr.LoginButton). Starting in version 6.6.0, the _target_url parameter is sanitized to only use the path, query, and fragment, stripping any scheme or host.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:56:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28416 | Gradio has SSRF via Malicious `proxy_url` Injection in `gr.load()` Config Processing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28416</link><description>Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. Prior to version 6.6.0, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Gradio allows an attacker to make arbitrary HTTP requests from a victim's server by hosting a malicious Gradio Space. When a victim application uses `gr.load()` to load an attacker-controlled Space, the malicious `proxy_url` from the config is trusted and added to the allowlist, enabling the attacker to access internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and private networks through the victim's infrastructure.

Starting in version 4.16.0 and prior to version 6.6.0, Gradio applications running outside of Hugging Face Spaces automatically enable "mocked" OAuth routes when OAuth components (e.g. `gr.LoginButton`) are used. When a user visits `/login/huggingface`, the server retrieves its own Hugging Face access token via `huggingface_hub.get_token()` and stores it in the visitor's session cookie. If the application is network-accessible, any remote attacker can trigger this flow to steal the server owner's HF token. The session cookie is signed with a hardcoded secret derived from the string `"-v4"`, making the payload trivially decodable. Version 6.6.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:56:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27939 | Statamic allows Authenticated Control Panel users to escalate privileges via elevated session bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27939</link><description>Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Starting in version 6.0.0 and prior to version 6.4.0, Authenticated Control Panel users may under certain conditions obtain elevated privileges without completing the intended verification step.

Prior to version 6.7, Gradio apps running on Window with Python 3.13+ are vulnerable to an absolute path traversal issue that enables unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the file system. Python 3.13+ changed the definition of `os.path.isabs` so that root-relative paths like `/windows/win.ini` on Windows are no longer considered absolute paths, resulting in a vulnerability in Gradio's logic for joining paths safely. This can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the Gradio server, even when Gradio is set up with authentication. Version 6.7 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:56:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28406 | kaniko has tar archive path traversal in build context extraction allows writing files outside destination directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28406</link><description>kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. Starting in version 1.25.4 and prior to version 1.25.10, kaniko unpacks build context archives using `filepath.Join(dest, cleanedName)` without enforcing that the final path stays within `dest`. A tar entry like `../outside.txt` escapes the extraction root and writes files outside the destination directory. In environments with registry authentication, this can be chained with docker credential helpers to achieve code execution within the executor process. Version 1.25.10 uses securejoin for path resolution in tar extraction.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:36:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28407 | malcontent&amp;#x27;s nested archive extraction failure can drop content from scan inputs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28407</link><description>malcontent is software for discovering supply-chain compromises through context, differential analysis, and YARA. Prior to version 1.21.0, malcontent would remove nested archives which failed to extract which could potentially leave malicious content.

Versions prior to 1.0.16 expose a  POST `/engines/_configure`  endpoint that accepts arbitrary runtime flags without authentication. These flags are passed directly to the underlying inference server (llama.cpp). By injecting the  --log-file  flag, an attacker with network access to the Model Runner API can write or overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the Model Runner process. When bundled with Docker Desktop (where Model Runner is enabled by default since version 4.46.0), it is reachable from any default container at  model-runner.docker.internal  without authentication. In this context, the file overwrite can target the Docker Desktop VM disk (`Docker.raw` ), resulting in the destruction of all containers, images, volumes, and build history. However, in specific configurations and with user interaction, it is possible to convert this vulnerability in a container escape. The issue is fixed in Docker Model Runner 1.0.16. Docker Desktop users should update to 4.61.0 or later, which includes the fixed Model Runner. A workaround is available. For Docker Desktop users, enabling Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) blocks container access to Model Runner, preventing exploitation. However, if the Docker Model Runner is exposed to localhost over TCP in specific configurations, the vulnerability is still exploitable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:36:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28402 | nimiq/core-rs-albatross&amp;#x27;s nimiq-blockchain missing proposal body root verification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28402</link><description>nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. Prior to version 1.2.2, a malicious or compromised validator that is elected as proposer can publish a macro block proposal where `header.body_root` does not match the actual macro body hash. The proposal can pass proposal verification because the macro proposal verification path validates the header but does not validate the binding `body_root == hash(body)`; later code expects this binding and may panic on mismatch, crashing validators. Note that the impact is only for validator nodes. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.2.2. The patch adds the corresponding body root verification in the proposal checks.

In versions prior to 3.3.11, the API endpoint used to manage event series is missing an access check, allowing unauthenticated/unauthorized access to this endpoint. The impact of this is limited to getting the metadata (title, category chain, start/end date) for events in an existing series, deleting an existing event series, and modifying an existing event series. This vulnerability does NOT allow unauthorized access to events (beyond the basic metadata mentioned above), nor any kind of tampering with user-visible data in events. Version 3.3.11 fixes the issue. As a workaround, use the webserver to restrict access to the series management API endpoint.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:36:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28355 | &amp;quot;PWA&amp;quot; Canarytoken Vulnerable to Stored Self Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28355</link><description>Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Versions prior to `sha-7ff0e12` have a Self Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the "PWA" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves or someone they share the link with. The creator of a PWA Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the title field of their PWA token. When the creator later browses the installation page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the install link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after sha-7ff0e12.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28338 | PMD Designer has Stored XSS in VBHTMLRenderer and YAHTMLRenderer via unescaped violation messages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28338</link><description>PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer.

The functions `addr2cidr` and `cidrlookup` may return leading zeros in a CIDR string, which may in turn be parsed as octal numbers by subsequent users. In some cases an attacker may be able to leverage this to bypass access controls based on IP addresses.

The documentation advises validating untrusted CIDR strings with the `cidrvalidate` function. However, this mitigation is optional and not enforced by default. In practice, users may call `addr2cidr` or `cidrlookup` with untrusted input and without validation, incorrectly assuming that this is safe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 01:04:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20742 | Copeland XWEB and XWEB Pro OS Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20742</link><description>An OS command injection

The function does not validate that the length parameter is non-negative. If a negative value (e.g. -1) is supplied, the expression length + 1u causes an integer wraparound, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. The subsequent call to chosen random function (e.g. getrandom) passes the original negative value, which is implicitly converted to a large unsigned value (typically SIZE_MAX). This can result in writes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to heap memory corruption and application crash (denial of service).

In common usage, the length argument is typically hardcoded by the caller, which reduces the likelihood of attacker-controlled exploitation. Applications that pass untrusted input to this parameter may be affected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 23:53:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20791 | Chargemap chargemap.com Insufficiently Protected Credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20791</link><description>Charging station authentication identifiers are publicly accessible via web-based mapping platforms.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 23:27:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20792 | Chargemap chargemap.com Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20792</link><description>The WebSocket Application Programming Interface lacks restrictions on

In versions up to and including 3.11.0, when a charger sends a StopTransaction message, SteVe looks up the transaction solely by transactionId (a sequential integer starting from 1) without verifying that the requesting charger matches the charger that originally started the transaction. Any authenticated charger can terminate any other charger’s active session across the entire network. The root cause is in OcppServerRepositoryImpl.getTransaction() which queries only by transactionId with no chargeBoxId ownership check. The validator checks that the transaction exists and is not already stopped but never verifies identity. As an attacker controlling a single registered charger I could enumerate sequential transaction IDs and send StopTransaction messages targeting active sessions on every other charger on the network simultaneously. Combined with FINDING-014 (unauthenticated SOAP endpoints), no registered charger is even required — the attack is executable with a single curl command requiring only a known chargeBoxId.

Prior to version 0.4.2, a command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) in the Zen C compiler allows local attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by providing a specially crafted output filename via the `-o` command-line argument. The vulnerability existed in the `main` application logic (specifically in `src/main.c`), where the compiler constructed a shell command string to invoke the backend C compiler. This command string was built by concatenating various arguments, including the user-controlled output filename, and was subsequently executed using the `system()` function. Because `system()` invokes a shell to parse and execute the command, shell metacharacters within the output filename were interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution. An attacker who can influence the command-line arguments passed to the `zc` compiler (like through a build script or a CI/CD pipeline configuration) can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the compiler. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.4.2 by removing `system()` calls, implementing `ArgList`, and internal argument handling. Users are advised to update to Zen C version v0.4.2 or later.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 22:57:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28208 | Junrar has arbitrary file write due to backslash path traversal bypass in LocalFolderExtractor on Linux/Unix</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28208</link><description>Junrar is an open source java RAR archive library.

A vulnerability has been identified in Umbraco Engage prior to versions 16.2.1 and 17.1.1 where certain API endpoints are exposed without enforcing authentication or authorization checks. The affected endpoints can be accessed directly over the network without requiring a valid session or user credentials. By supplying a user-controlled identifier parameter (e.g., ?id=), an attacker can retrieve sensitive data associated with arbitrary records. Because no access control validation is performed, the endpoints are vulnerable to enumeration attacks, allowing attackers to iterate over identifiers and extract data at scale. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive Engage-related data by directly querying the affected API endpoints. The vulnerability allows arbitrary record access through predictable or enumerable identifiers. The confidentiality impact is considered high.

Prior to version 5.16.1, the REST API's `AddonViewSet` (`weblate/api/views.py`, line 2831) uses `queryset = Addon.objects.all()` without overriding `get_queryset()` to scope results by user permissions. This allows any authenticated user (or anonymous users if `REQUIRE_LOGIN` is not set) to list and retrieve ALL addons across all projects and components via `GET /api/addons/` and `GET /api/addons/{id}/`. Version 5.16.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 22:20:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27835 | wger: IDOR in RepetitionsConfig and MaxRepetitionsConfig API leak other users&amp;#x27; workout data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27835</link><description>wger is a free, open-source workout and fitness manager.

Prior to commit bf28c82dc9b1f630fa8e9106358771b20a0040f7, the API endpoint for creating a card update session during an upgrade flow was accessible to users with only organization member privileges. When the associated Stripe Checkout session is completed, the Stripe webhook updates the organization’s default payment method. Because no billing-specific authorization check is enforced, a regular (non-billing) member can change the organization’s payment method. This vulnerability affected the Zulip Cloud payment processing system, and has been patched as of commit bf28c82dc9b1f630fa8e9106358771b20a0040f7. Self-hosted deploys are no longer affected and no patch or upgrade is required for them.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 22:20:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28219 | Privilege Escalation via Mass Assignment Allows Regular Users to Set Topics as Global Banners</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28219</link><description>Discourse is an open source discussion platform.

In versions prior to 4.80.1, Fleet generated device lock and wipe PINs using a predictable algorithm based solely on the current Unix timestamp. Because no secret key or additional entropy was used, the resulting PIN could potentially be derived if the approximate time the device was locked is known. Fleet’s device lock and wipe commands generate a 6-digit PIN that is displayed to administrators for unlocking a device. In affected versions, this PIN was deterministically derived from the current timestamp. An attacker with physical possession of a locked device and knowledge of the approximate time the lock command was issued could theoretically predict the correct PIN within a limited search window. However, successful exploitation is constrained by multiple factors: Physical access to the device is required, the approximate lock time must be known, the operating system enforces rate limiting on PIN entry attempts, attempts would need to be spread over, and device wipe operations would typically complete before sufficient attempts could be made. As a result, this issue does not allow remote exploitation, fleet-wide compromise, or bypass of Fleet authentication controls. Version 4.80.1 contains a patch. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24004 | Fleet: Unauthenticated Android device disenrollment vulnerability via Pub/Sub endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24004</link><description>Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a vulnerability in Fleet’s Android MDM Pub/Sub handling could allow unauthenticated requests to trigger device unenrollment events. This may result in unauthorized removal of individual Android devices from Fleet management. If Android MDM is enabled, an attacker could send a crafted request to the Android Pub/Sub endpoint to unenroll a targeted Android device from Fleet without authentication. This issue does not grant access to Fleet, allow execution of commands, or provide visibility into device data. Impact is limited to disruption of Android device management for the affected device. Version 4.80.1 fixes the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected Fleet users should temporarily disable Android MDM.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25963 | Fleet: Authorization Bypass in certificate template batch deletion for team administrators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25963</link><description>Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a broken authorization check in Fleet’s certificate template deletion API could allow a team administrator to delete certificate templates belonging to other teams within the same Fleet instance. Fleet supports certificate templates that are scoped to individual teams. In affected versions, the batch deletion endpoint validated authorization using a user-supplied team identifier but did not verify that the certificate template IDs being deleted actually belonged to that team. As a result, a team administrator could delete certificate templates associated with other teams, potentially disrupting certificate-based workflows such as device enrollment, Wi-Fi authentication, VPN access, or other certificate-dependent configurations for the affected teams. This issue does not allow privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, or compromise of Fleet’s control plane. Impact is limited to integrity and availability of certificate templates across teams. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should restrict access to certificate template management to trusted users and avoid delegating team administrator permissions where not strictly required.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27465 | Fleet: Sensitive Google Calendar credentials disclosed to low-privileged users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27465</link><description>Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a vulnerability in Fleet’s configuration API could expose Google Calendar service account credentials to authenticated users with low-privilege roles. This may allow unauthorized access to Google Calendar resources associated with the service account. Fleet returns configuration data through an API endpoint that is accessible to authenticated users, including those with the lowest-privilege “Observer” role. In affected versions, Google Calendar service account credentials were not properly obfuscated before being returned. As a result, a low-privilege user could retrieve the service account’s private key material. Depending on how the Google Calendar integration is configured, this could allow unauthorized access to calendar data or other Google Workspace resources associated with the service account. This issue does not allow escalation of privileges within Fleet or access to device management functionality. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should remove the Google Calendar integration from Fleet and rotate the affected Google service account credentials.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27963 | Audiobookshelf has Stored XSS in Tooltip.vue via Audiobook Metadata</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27963</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.

In Agenta-API prior to version 0.48.1, a Python sandbox escape vulnerability existed in Agenta's custom code evaluator. Agenta used RestrictedPython as a sandboxing mechanism for user-supplied evaluator code, but incorrectly whitelisted the `numpy` package as safe within the sandbox. This allowed authenticated users to bypass the sandbox and achieve arbitrary code execution on the API server. The escape path was through `numpy.ma.core.inspect`, which exposes Python's introspection utilities — including `sys.modules` — thereby providing access to unfiltered system-level functionality like `os.system`. This vulnerability affects the Agenta self-hosted platform (API server), not the SDK when used as a standalone Python library. The custom code evaluator runs server-side within the API process. The issue is fixed in v0.48.1 by removing `numpy` from the sandbox allowlist. In later versions (v0.60+), the RestrictedPython sandbox was removed entirely and replaced with a different execution model.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27954 | LiveHelperChat has department-level authorization bypass in holdaction, blockuser, and transferchat endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27954</link><description>Live Helper Chat is an open-source application that enables live support websites.

Versions prior to 21.2.0, 21.1.16, 20.3.17, and 19.2.19 have a cross-Site scripting vulnerability in the Angular internationalization (i18n) pipeline. In ICU messages (International Components for Unicode), HTML from translated content was not properly sanitized and could execute arbitrary JavaScript. Angular i18n typically involves three steps, extracting all messages from an application in the source language, sending the messages to be translated, and then merging their translations back into the final source code. Translations are frequently handled by contracts with specific partner companies, and involve sending the source messages to a separate contractor before receiving final translations for display to the end user. If the returned translations have malicious content, it could be rendered into the application and execute arbitrary JavaScript. When successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows for execution of attacker controlled JavaScript in the application origin. Depending on the nature of the application being exploited this could lead to credential exfiltration and/or page vandalism. Several preconditions apply to the attack. The attacker must compromise the translation file (xliff, xtb, etc.). Unlike most XSS vulnerabilities, this issue is not exploitable by arbitrary users. An attacker must first compromise an application's translation file before they can escalate privileges into the Angular application client. The victim application must use Angular i18n, use one or more ICU messages, render an ICU message, and not defend against XSS via a safe content security policy. Versions 21.2.0, 21.1.6, 20.3.17, and 19.2.19 patch the issue. Until the patch is applied, developers should consider reviewing and verifying translated content received from untrusted third parties before incorporating it in an Angular application, enabling strict CSP controls to block unauthorized JavaScript from executing on the page, and enabling Trusted Types to enforce proper HTML sanitization.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 03:38:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27973 | Audiobookshelf has Stored XSS in ItemSearchCard.vue via Audiobook Metadata (Search Results on Mobile App)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27973</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.

Prior to version 2.1.3, any authenticated non-admin user can become a full administrator by sending a single PUT request to their own user profile endpoint with `"IsAdmin": true` in the JSON body. After logging out and back in, the session picks up admin privileges from the database. When a user updates their own profile, the server parses the full JSON body into the user model, including the `IsAdmin` boolean field. A function responsible for preserving calculated or protected attributes pins certain fields to their database values (such as base model data, linked peer count, and authentication data), but it does not do this for `IsAdmin`. As a result, whatever value the client sends for `IsAdmin` is written directly to the database. After the exploit, the attacker has full admin access to the WireGuard VPN management portal.

Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.3, `matchOne()` performs unbounded recursive backtracking when a glob pattern contains multiple non-adjacent `**` (GLOBSTAR) segments and the input path does not match. The time complexity is O(C(n, k)) -- binomial -- where `n` is the number of path segments and `k` is the number of globstars. With k=11 and n=30, a call to the default `minimatch()` API stalls for roughly 5 seconds. With k=13, it exceeds 15 seconds. No memoization or call budget exists to bound this behavior. Any application where an attacker can influence the glob pattern passed to `minimatch()` is vulnerable. The realistic attack surface includes build tools and task runners that accept user-supplied glob arguments (ESLint, Webpack, Rollup config), multi-tenant systems where one tenant configures glob-based rules that run in a shared process, admin or developer interfaces that accept ignore-rule or filter configuration as globs, and CI/CD pipelines that evaluate user-submitted config files containing glob patterns. An attacker who can place a crafted pattern into any of these paths can stall the Node.js event loop for tens of seconds per invocation. The pattern is 56 bytes for a 5-second stall and does not require authentication in contexts where pattern input is part of the feature.

Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.4, nested `*()` extglobs produce regexps with nested unbounded quantifiers (e.g. `(?:(?:a|b)*)*`), which exhibit catastrophic backtracking in V8. With a 12-byte pattern `*(*(*(a|b)))` and an 18-byte non-matching input, `minimatch()` stalls for over 7 seconds. Adding a single nesting level or a few input characters pushes this to minutes. This is the most severe finding: it is triggered by the default `minimatch()` API with no special options, and the minimum viable pattern is only 12 bytes. The same issue affects `+()` extglobs equally.

In versions 9.0.0 through 9.5.3, a bug in Astro's image pipeline allows bypassing `image.domains` / `image.remotePatterns` restrictions, enabling the server to fetch content from unauthorized remote hosts. Astro provides an `inferSize` option that fetches remote images at render time to determine their dimensions. Remote image fetches are intended to be restricted to domains the site developer has manually authorized (using the `image.domains` or `image.remotePatterns` options). However, when `inferSize` is used, no domain validation is performed — the image is fetched from any host regardless of the configured restrictions. An attacker who can influence the image URL (e.g., via CMS content or user-supplied data) can cause the server to fetch from arbitrary hosts. This allows bypassing `image.domains` / `image.remotePatterns` restrictions to make server-side requests to unauthorized hosts. This includes the risk of server-side request forgery (SSRF) against internal network services and cloud metadata endpoints. Version 9.5.4 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27830 | c3p0 vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via unsafe deserialization of userOverridesAsString property</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27830</link><description>c3p0, a JDBC Connection pooling library, is vulnerable to attack via maliciously crafted Java-serialized objects and `javax.naming.Reference` instances. Several c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource` implementations have a property called `userOverridesAsString` which conceptually represents a `Map&gt;`. Prior to v0.12.0, that property was maintained as a hex-encoded serialized object. Any attacker able to reset this property, on an existing `ConnectionPoolDataSource` or via maliciously crafted serialized objects or `javax.naming.Reference` instances could be tailored execute unexpected code on the application's `CLASSPATH`. The danger of this vulnerability was strongly magnified by vulnerabilities in c3p0's main dependency, mchange-commons-java. This library includes code that mirrors early implementations of JNDI functionality, including ungated support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values. Attackers could set c3p0's `userOverridesAsString` hex-encoded serialized objects that include objects "indirectly serialized" via JNDI references. Deserialization of those objects and dereferencing of the embedded `javax.naming.Reference` objects could provoke download and execution of malicious code from a remote `factoryClassLocation`. Although hazard presented by c3p0's vulnerabilites are exarcerbated by vulnerabilities in mchange-commons-java, use of Java-serialized-object hex as the format for a writable Java-Bean property, of objects that may be exposed across JNDI interfaces, represents a serious independent fragility. The `userOverridesAsString` property of c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource` classes has been reimplemented to use a safe CSV-based format, rather than rely upon potentially dangerous Java object deserialization. c3p0-0.12.0+ and above depend upon mchange-commons-java 0.4.0+, which gates support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values by configuration parameters that default to restrictive values. c3p0 additionally enforces the new mchange-commons-java `com.mchange.v2.naming.nameGuardClassName` to prevent injection of unexpected, potentially remote JNDI names. There is no supported workaround for versions of c3p0 prior to 0.12.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27831 | rldns Vulnerable to Heap-based Out-of-Bounds Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27831</link><description>rldns is an open source DNS server.

Starting in version 2.31.0 and prior to versions 3.4.7 and 4.11.0, opaque OIDC access tokens in the v2 format truncated to 80 characters are still considered valid.  Zitadel uses a symmetric AES encryption for opaque tokens. The cleartext payload is a concatenation of a couple of identifiers, such as a token ID and user ID. Internally Zitadel has 2 different versions of token payloads. v1 tokens are no longer created, but are still verified as to not invalidate existing session after upgrade. The cleartext payload has a format of `:`. v2 tokens distinguished further where the `token_id` is of the format `v2_-at_`. V1 token authZ/N session data is retrieved from the database using the (simple) `token_id` value and `user_id` value. The `user_id` (called `subject` in some parts of our code) was used as being the trusted user ID. V2 token authZ/N session data is retrieved from the database using the `oidc_session_id` and `access_token_id` and in this case the `user_id` from the token is ignored and taken from the session data in the database. By truncating the token to 80 chars, the user_id is now missing from the cleartext of the v2 token. The back-end still accepts this for above reasons. This issue is not considered exploitable, but may look awkward when reproduced. The patch in versions 4.11.0 and 3.4.7 resolves the issue by verifying the `user_id` from the token against the session data from the database. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27884 | NetExec vulnerable to arbitrary file write via path traversal in spider_plus module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27884</link><description>NetExec is a network execution tool. Prior to version 1.5.1, the module spider_plus improperly creates the output file and folder path when saving files from SMB shares.

Go's standard library performs case-insensitive matching of JSON keys to struct field tags — a field tagged json:"method" would also match "Method", "METHOD", etc. This violated the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, which defines exact field names. A malicious MCP peer may have been able to send protocol messages with non-standard field casing that the SDK would silently accept. This had the potential for bypassing intermediary inspection and coss-implementation inconsistency. Go's standard JSON unmarshaling was replaced with a case-sensitive decoder in commit 7b8d81c. Users are advised to update to v1.3.1 to resolve this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27945 | ZITADEL has potential SSRF via Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27945</link><description>ZITADEL is an open source identity management platform. Zitadel Action V2 (introduced as early preview in 2.59.0, beta in 3.0.0 and GA in 4.0.0) is a webhook based approach to allow developers act on API request to Zitadel and customize flows such the issue of a token. Zitadel's Action target URLs can point to local hosts, potentially allowing adversaries to gather internal network information and connect to internal services. When the URL points to a local host / IP address, an adversary might gather information about the internal network structure, the services exposed on internal hosts etc. This is sometimes called a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Zitadel Actions expect responses according to specific schemas, which reduces the threat vector. The patch in version 4.11.1 resolves the issue by checking the target URL against a denylist. By default localhost, resp. loopback IPs are denied. Note that this fix was only released on v4.x. Due to the stage (preview / beta) in which the functionality was in v2.x and v3.x, the changes that have been applied to it since then and the severity, respectively the actual thread vector, a backport to the corresponding versions was not feasible. Please check the workaround section for alternative solutions if an upgrade to v4.x is not possible. If an upgrade is not possible, prevent actions from using unintended endpoints by setting network policies or firewall rules in one's own infrastructure. Note that this is outside of the functionality provided by Zitadel.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27946 | ZITADEL Users Can Self-Verify Email/Phone via UpdateHumanUser API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27946</link><description>ZITADEL is an open source identity management platform.

If an upgrade is not possible, an action (v2) could be used to prevent setting the verification flag on the own user.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26186 | Fleet has a SQL injection via backtick escape in ORDER BY parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26186</link><description>Fleet is open source device management software. A SQL injection vulnerability in versions prior to 4.80.1 allowed authenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL expressions via the `order_key` query parameter. Due to unsafe use of `goqu.I()` when constructing the `ORDER BY` clause, specially crafted input could escape identifier quoting and be interpreted as executable SQL. An authenticated attacker with access to the affected endpoint could inject SQL expressions into the underlying MySQL query. Although the injection occurs in an `ORDER BY` context, it is sufficient to enable blind SQL injection techniques that can disclose database information through conditional expressions that affect result ordering. Crafted expressions may also cause excessive computation or query failures, potentially leading to degraded performance or denial of service. No direct evidence of reliable data modification or stacked query execution was demonstrated. Version 4.80.1 fixes the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, users should restrict access to the affected endpoint to trusted roles only and ensure that any user-supplied sort or column parameters are strictly allow-listed at the application or proxy layer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 01:02:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27809 | psd-tools: Compression module has unguarded zlib decompression, missing dimension validation, and hardening gaps</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27809</link><description>psd-tools is a Python package for working with Adobe Photoshop PSD files.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 0.1.85 is a Password Reset Poisoning (Host Header / Forwarded Header trust issue), which allows attackers to manipulate the password reset link. Attackers can exploit this flaw to inject their own domain into the password reset link, leading to the potential for account takeover. The vulnerability has been fixed in version v0.1.85. If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the "forgot password" feature until an upgrade to a patched version can be performed.
