This vulnerability exists in Tapo C500 Wi-Fi camera due to hard-coded RSA private key embedded within the device firmware. An attacker with physical access could exploit this vulnerability to obtain cryptographic private keys which can then be used to perform impersonation, data decryption and man in the middle attacks on the targeted device.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:51:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57949 | irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don&amp;#x27;t enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57949</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()

The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt
disabled section:

irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
  irq_get_desc_lock()
     raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   &lt;--- Disable interrupts
  its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
     guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   &lt;--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()
  irq_put_desc_unlock()        &lt;--- Warns because interrupts are enabled

This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original
raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).

Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).

gpio: xilinx: Convert gpio_lock to raw spinlock

irq_chip functions may be called in raw spinlock context. Therefore, we
must also use a raw spinlock for our own internal locking.

This fixes the following lockdep splat:

platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race

The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev-&gt;ops is valid when
SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
devm_serdev_device_open().

Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()
calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 11:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13440 | Super Store Finder &amp;lt;= 7.0 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection to Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13440</link><description>The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘ssf_wp_user_name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
