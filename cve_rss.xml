This lack of security markings could lead to unintended access to the uploaded files.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62487</link><description>### Details
On October 1, 2025, Palantir discovered that images uploaded through the Dossier front-end app were not being marked correctly with the proper security levels. The regression was traced back to a change in May 2025, which was meant to allow file uploads to be shared among different artifacts (e.g. other dossiers and presentations).

On deployments configured with CBAC, the front-end would present a security picker dialog to set the security level on the uploads, thereby mitigating the issue.

On deployments without a CBAC configuration, no security picker dialog appears, leading to a security level of CUSTOM with no markings or datasets selected. The resulting markings and groups for the file uploads thus will be only those added by the “Default authorization rules” defined in the Auth Chooser configuration. On most environments, it is expected that the “Default authorization rules" only add the Everyone group.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:35:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0830 | Command Injection in Kiro GitLab Merge Request Helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0830</link><description>Processing specially crafted workspace folder names could allow for arbitrary command injection in the Kiro GitLab Merge-Request helper in Kiro IDE before version 0.6.18 when opening maliciously crafted workspaces.

This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.

This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15464 | KL-001-2026-01: yintibao Fun Print Mobile Unauthorized Access via Context Hijacking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15464</link><description>Exported Activity allows external applications to gain application context and directly launch Gmail with inbox access, bypassing security controls.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68718 | KAYSUS KS-WR1200 routers with firmware 107 expose SSH and TELNET services on the LAN interface with hardcoded root credentials (root:1234567...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68718</link><description>KAYSUS KS-WR1200 routers with firmware 107 expose SSH and TELNET services on the LAN interface with hardcoded root credentials (root:12345678).

In version 1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not tied to the initiating user session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker that has a valid state (easily obtainable via an attacker-initiated authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client registry, FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob under _state_{app}_{state}, and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session altogether. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:36:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67825 | An issue was discovered in Nitro PDF Pro for Windows before 14.42.0.34.

Prior to version 11.14.0, an open redirect vulnerability exists in the Directus SAML authentication callback endpoint. During SAML authentication, the `RelayState` parameter is intended to preserve the user's original destination. However, while the login initiation flow validates redirect targets against allowed domains, this validation is not applied to the callback endpoint.

A regression introduced in Preact 10.26.5 caused this protection to be softened. In applications where values from JSON payloads are assumed to be strings and passed unmodified to Preact as children, a specially-crafted JSON payload could be constructed that would be incorrectly treated as a valid VNode. When this chain of failures occurs it can result in HTML injection, which can allow arbitrary script execution if not mitigated by CSP or other means. Applications using affected Preact versions are vulnerable if they meet all of the following conditions: first, pass unmodified, unsanitized values from user-modifiable data sources (APIs, databases, local storage, etc.) directly into the render tree; second assume these values are strings but the data source could return actual JavaScript objects instead of JSON strings; and third, the data source either fails to perform type sanitization AND blindly stores/returns raw objects interchangeably with strings, OR is compromised (e.g., poisoned local storage, filesystem, or database). Versions 10.26.10, 10.27.3, and 10.28.2 patch the issue. The patch versions restore the previous strict equality checks that prevent JSON-parsed objects from being treated as valid VNodes. Other mitigations are available for those who cannot immediately upgrade.

In versions from 0.150.0 to before 2.2.2, an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events. The Stripe Trigger creates and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret when registering the webhook endpoint, but incoming webhook requests were not verified against this secret. As a result, any HTTP client that knows the webhook URL could send a POST request containing a matching event type, causing the workflow to execute as if a legitimate Stripe event had been received. This issue affects n8n users who have active workflows using the Stripe Trigger node. An attacker could potentially fake payment or subscription events and influence downstream workflow behavior. The practical risk is reduced by the fact that the webhook URL contains a high-entropy UUID; however, authenticated n8n users with access to the workflow can view this webhook ID. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.2. A temporary workaround for this issue involves users deactivating affected workflows or restricting access to workflows containing Stripe Trigger nodes to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:18:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22242 | CoreShop Vulnerable to SQL Injection via Admin Reports</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22242</link><description>CoreShop is a Pimcore enhanced eCommerce solution.

From versions v2.10.0 to 3.4.1, an unauthenticated attacker can exhaust Redis connections by repeatedly opening and closing browser tabs on any NiceGUI application using Redis-backed storage. Connections are never released, leading to service degradation when Redis hits its connection limit. NiceGUI continues accepting new connections - errors are logged but the app stays up with broken storage functionality.

In versions 3.8.1 and below, if a server is configured with an allowlist (e.g., dashboard.corp), an attacker can register a domain like dashboard.corp.attacker.com (or use a subdomain if applicable) and lure a victim to visit it. The malicious site can then initiate a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable Bokeh server. Since the Origin header (e.g., http://dashboard.corp.attacker.com/) matches the allowlist according to the flawed logic, the connection is accepted. Once connected, the attacker can interact with the Bokeh server on behalf of the victim, potentially accessing sensitive data, or modifying visualizations. This issue is fixed in version 3.8.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:56:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21877 | n8n is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Arbitrary File Write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21877</link><description>n8n is an open source workflow automation platform.

Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]). The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username containing regex meta-characters (e.g., deeply nested groups or quantifiers), causing the MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in the URL path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22035 | Greenshot Vulnerable to OS Command Injection via ExternalCommand Plugin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22035</link><description>Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility.

Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection.

Because the WOLFSSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT flag was not included, the behavior effectively matched CERT_OPTIONAL: a peer certificate was verified if presented, but connections were incorrectly authenticated when no client certificate was provided. 

This results in improper authentication, allowing attackers to bypass mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication by omitting a client certificate during the TLS handshake. 

The issue affects versions up to and including 5.8.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:44:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21869 | llama.cpp has Out-of-bounds Write in llama-server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21869</link><description>llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative.

In versions 0.99.49 and below, an API has a Mass Assignment vulnerability which allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary fields into time entries, bypassing business logic controls via the customfields parameter. The affected endpoint uses the JavaScript spread operator (...customfields) to merge user-controlled input directly into the database document. While customfields is validated as an Object type, there is no validation of which keys are permitted inside that object. This allows attackers to overwrite protected fields such as userId, hours, and state. The issue is fixed in version 0.99.50.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:44:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21859 | Mailpit Proxy Endpoint is Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21859</link><description>Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers.

Proper management of this functionality helps ensure a secure and seamless user experience.  Although the user input is not validated in the report creation, these scripts are not executed when the report is run by end users. The script is executed when the report is modified through the report builder by a user with edit permissions. 




The Report Builder is part of the WebConsole.  The WebConsole package is currently end of life, and is no longer maintained. We strongly recommend against installing or using it in any production environment. However, if you choose to install it, for example, to access functionality like the Report Builder, it must be deployed within a fully isolated network that has no access to sensitive data or internet connectivity. This is a critical security precaution, as the retired package may contain unpatched vulnerabilities and is no longer supported with updates or fixes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:13:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21441 | urllib3 vulnerable to decompression-bomb safeguard bypass when following HTTP redirects (streaming API)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21441</link><description>urllib3 is an HTTP client library for Python. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client. Applications and libraries are affected when they stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects. Users should upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3, in which the library does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`. If upgrading is not immediately possible, disable redirects by setting `redirect=False` for requests to untrusted source.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:13:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22046 | iccDEV has heap-buffer-overflow in CIccProfileXml::ParseBasic() at IccXML/IccLibXML/IccProfileXml.cpp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22046</link><description>iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of International Color Consortium (ICC) color management profiles.

The attack requires the victim to install a package that has an HTTP/git tarball in its dependency tree. The victim's lockfile provides no protection. This issue is fixed in version 10.26.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 21:45:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21685 | iccDEV has Undefined Behavior in CIccTagLut16::Read()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21685</link><description>iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of International Color Consortium (ICC) color management profiles.

Version 0.5.8 of filesystem-mcp contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its "read_content" tool. This vulnerability arises from improper symlink handling in the path validation mechanism: the resolvePath function checks path validity before resolving symlinks, while fs.readFile resolves symlinks automatically during file access. This allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions by leveraging symlinks within the allowed directory that point to external files, enabling unauthorized access to files outside the intended operational scope.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:15:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22536 | PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VIA SUDO COMMAND</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22536</link><description>The absence of permissions control for the user XXX allows the current configuration in the sudoers file to escalate privileges without any restrictions</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:15:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67364 | fast-filesystem-mcp version 3.4.0 contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its file operation tools including fast_read_file.

This vulnerability arises from improper path validation that fails to resolve symbolic links to their actual physical paths. The safePath and isPathAllowed functions use path.resolve() which does not handle symlinks, allowing attackers to bypass directory access restrictions by creating symlinks within allowed directories that point to restricted system paths. When these symlinks are accessed through valid path references, the validation checks are circumvented, enabling access to unauthorized files.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:52:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22535 | FRAIL SECURITY IN MQTT PROTOCOL ALLOWS AN ATTACKER MODIFY CRITICAL PARAMETERS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22535</link><description>An attacker with the ability to interact through the network and with access credentials, could, thanks to the unsecured (unencrypted) MQTT communications protocol, write on the server topics of the board that controls the MQTT communications</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:52:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65805 | OpenAirInterface CN5G AMF&lt;=v2.1.9 has a buffer overflow vulnerability in processing NAS messages.
