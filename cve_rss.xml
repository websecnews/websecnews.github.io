However, all versions of the platform through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu, which may result in complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively, however certain areas of the front end lack this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication handling that the front-end uses, a malicious user may be able to take over any victim's account provided they meet the exploitation steps. As of time of publication, no patched version is available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 20:17:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6558 | HMS Industrial Networks Anybus-CompactCom 30 Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6558</link><description>HMS Industrial Networks

Anybus-CompactCom 30 products are vulnerable to a XSS attack caused by the lack of input sanitation checks.

The stored HTML code will be embedded in the page and executed by host browser the next time the page is loaded, enabling social engineering attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:57:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29069 | snapd will follow archived symlinks when unpacking a filesystem</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29069</link><description>In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the
destination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format 
is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and
other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image
(such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when
it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a
malicious snap which contained symbolic links at these paths could then 
cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link destination
into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged
user to gain access to privileged information.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:47:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38287 | The password-reset mechanism in the Forgot Password functionality in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows unauthenticated remote attackers ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38287</link><description>The password-reset mechanism in the Forgot Password functionality in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the application into resetting the administrator's password to a random insecure 8-digit value.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:47:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38288 | A command-injection issue in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) functionality in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows authenticated atta...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38288</link><description>A command-injection issue in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) functionality in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows authenticated attackers with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server as root.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:47:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38289 | A boolean-based SQL injection issue in the Virtual Meeting Password (VMP) endpoint in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows unauthenticated ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38289</link><description>A boolean-based SQL injection issue in the Virtual Meeting Password (VMP) endpoint in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows unauthenticated remote attackers to extract hashed passwords from the database, and authenticate to the application, via crafted SQL input.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:47:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40324 | A CRLF injection vulnerability in E-Staff v5.1 allows attackers to insert Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters into input fiel...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40324</link><description>A CRLF injection vulnerability in E-Staff v5.1 allows attackers to insert Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters into input fields, leading to HTTP response splitting and header manipulation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:47:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29068 | snapd non-regular file indefinite blocking read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29068</link><description>In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file

(such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An 
attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which
contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block

sandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin
path. In Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added to
the users PATH. An attacker who could convince a user to install a
malicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerability
to install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be run
by the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow them
to escape confinement.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:17:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40318 | An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Webkul Qloapps v1.6.0.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40318</link><description>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Webkul Qloapps v1.6.0.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 18:40:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28772 | IBM Security Directory Integrator cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28772</link><description>IBM Security Directory Integrator 7.2.0 and IBM Security Verify Directory Integrator 10.0.0 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting.

Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 16:56:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36542 | Insecure permissions in kuma v2.7.0 allows attackers to access sensitive data and escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's tok...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36542</link><description>Insecure permissions in kuma v2.7.0 allows attackers to access sensitive data and escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's token.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 16:56:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7007 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel in Positron Broadcast Signal Processor TRA7005</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7007</link><description>Positron Broadcast Signal Processor TRA7005 v1.20 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass exploit that could allow an attacker to have unauthorized access to protected areas of the application.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 16:56:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41800 | Craft CMS Allows TOTP Token To Stay Valid After Use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41800</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS).

Starting in version 1.6.3 and prior to version 1.8.0, there is a defect in the KubePi JWT token verification. The JWT key in the default configuration file is empty. Although a random 32-bit string will be generated to overwrite the key in the configuration file when the key is detected to be empty in the configuration file reading logic, the key is empty during actual verification. Using an empty key to generate a JWT token can bypass the login verification and directly take over the back end. Version 1.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 13:39:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39671 | Access control vulnerability in the security verification module.

Versions of Bitbucket DC from 8.0.0 to 8.9.12 and 8.19.0 to 8.19.1 are affected by this vulnerability. It is patched in 8.9.13 and 8.19.2.

This open redirect vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 3.1 and a CVSS Vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, allows an unauthenticated attacker to redirect a victim user upon login to Bitbucket Data Center to any arbitrary site which can be utilized for further exploitation which has low impact to confidentiality, no impact to integrity, no impact to availability, and requires user interaction.

Atlassian recommends that Bitbucket Data Center customers upgrade to the version. If you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the  supported fixed versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 18:14:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41672 | DuckDB: sniff_csv provides filesystem access even when enable_external_access is disabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41672</link><description>DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesn't seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 17:53:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41667 | OpenAM FreeMarker template injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41667</link><description>OpenAM is an open access management solution. In versions 15.0.3 and prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the default PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud login page,they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`, allowing it to be set freely. Commit fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8 introduces `TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER` to disable the resolution of commonly exploited classes in FreeMarker template injection. As of time of publication, this fix is expected to be part of version 15.0.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 17:34:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41666 | The Argo CD web terminal session does not handle the revocation of user permissions properly.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41666</link><description>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 17:34:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37533 | IBM InfoSphere Information Server information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37533</link><description>IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 could disclose sensitive user information to another user with physical access to the machine.

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.

Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.

A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.

docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.0, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 17:04:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41662 | VNote vulnerable to Markdown XSS, which leads to RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41662</link><description>VNote is a note-taking platform.

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:56:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6874 | macidn punycode buffer overread</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6874</link><description>libcurl's URL API function
[curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode
conversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256
bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to
use the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the
provided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.

This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of
the converted string.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6197 | freeing stack buffer in utf8asn1str</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6197</link><description>libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.  The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special circumstances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6930 | WP Booking Calendar &amp;lt;= 10.2.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via bookingform Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6930</link><description>The WP Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'type' attribute within the plugin's bookingform shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 10.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 24.7.1, an unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows storing arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side with the subsequent rendering them on the Issues page. Self-hosted Sentry users may be impacted in case of untrustworthy Integration platform integrations sending external issues from their side to Sentry. A patch has been released in Sentry 24.7.1. For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has been patched on July 23, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site. For self-hosted users, the maintainers of Sentry strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is not possible, one could enable CSP on one's self-hosted installation with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 21:39:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0981 | Okta Browser Plugin versions 6.5.0 through 6.31.0 (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

injecting garbage data or specially crafted data. Depending on the data injected each process might be
affected differently. The process could crash or cause communication issues on the affected node, effectively causing a denial-of-service attack. The attacker could tamper with the data transmitted, causing
the product to store wrong information or act on wrong data or display wrong information.


This issue affects Advant MOD 300 AdvaBuild: from 3.0 through 3.7 SP2.




For an attack to be successful, the attacker must have local access to a node in the system and be able to
start a specially crafted application that disrupts the communication.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to manipulate the data in such
way as allowing reads and writes to the controllers or cause Windows processes in 800xA for MOD 300

Prior to `sha-8ea5315`, Canarytokens.org was vulnerable to a blind SSRF in the Webhook alert feature. When a Canarytoken is created, users choose to receive alerts either via email or via a webhook. If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created, the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request. Using the Blind SSRF, it was possible to map out open ports for IPs inside the Canarytokens.org infrastructure. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 17:08:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41178 | Apache Arrow Rust Object Store: AWS WebIdentityToken exposure in log files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41178</link><description>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store, version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. 

On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.

Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.

Details:

When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs.

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the "Cloned Website" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves. The creator of a slow-redirect Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. When the creator later browses the management page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the management link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 16:25:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39702 | In lj_str_hash.c in OpenResty 1.19.3.1 through 1.25.3.1, the string hashing function (used during string interning) allows HashDoS (Hash Den...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39702</link><description>In lj_str_hash.c in OpenResty 1.19.3.1 through 1.25.3.1, the string hashing function (used during string interning) allows HashDoS (Hash Denial of Service) attacks.

filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
do_lock_file_wait().
However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
in the middle).

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.

Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 08:12:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4260 | CoBlocks &amp;lt; 3.1.12 - Contributor+ SSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4260</link><description>The Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks  WordPress plugin before 3.1.12 does not prevent users from pinging arbitrary hosts via some of its shortcodes, which could allow high privilege users such as contributors to perform SSRF attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6231 | Request a Quote &amp;lt; 2.4.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6231</link><description>The Request a Quote WordPress plugin before 2.4.1 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6420 | Hide My WP Ghost &amp;lt; 5.2.02 - Hidden Login Page Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6420</link><description>The Hide My WP Ghost  WordPress plugin before 5.2.02 does not prevent redirects to the login page via the auth_redirect WordPress function, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to access the hidden login page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6828 | Redux Framework 4.4.12 -  4.4.17 - Unauthenticated JSON File Upload to Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6828</link><description>The Redux Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated JSON file uploads due to missing authorization and capability checks on the Redux_Color_Scheme_Import function in versions 4.4.12 to 4.4.17.
