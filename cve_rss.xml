User-controlled input is passed to PHP's unserialize(): the POST parameter `formkit_memory_recovery` in \\RoxPostHandler::getCallbackAction and the 'memory cookie' read by \\RoxModelBase::getMemoryCookie (bwRemember). (1) If present, `formkit_memory_recovery` is processed and passed to unserialize(), and (2) restore-from-memory functionality calls unserialize() on the bwRemember cookie value. Gadget chains present in Rox and bundled libraries enable exploitation of object injection to write arbitrary files or achieve remote code execution. Successful exploitation can lead to full site compromise. This vulnerability was introduced with commit f09be94 (2025-01-03) and remediated with commit c60bf04 (2025-06-16).</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 14:41:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61482 | Improper handling of OTP/TOTP/HOTP values in NetKnights GmbH privacyIDEA Authenticator v.4.3.0 on Android allows local attackers with root a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61482</link><description>Improper handling of OTP/TOTP/HOTP values in NetKnights GmbH privacyIDEA Authenticator v.4.3.0 on Android allows local attackers with root access to bypass two factor authentication.

This makes it possible for attackers to bypass authorization by spoofing these headers with the IP address of a legitimately authenticated user, granted the "Use transients" option is enabled (non-default configuration) and the site is not behind a CDN or reverse proxy that overwrites these headers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 05:43:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11269 | Product Filter by WBW &amp;lt;= 3.0.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Settings Update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11269</link><description>The Product Filter by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'approveNotice' action in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.
