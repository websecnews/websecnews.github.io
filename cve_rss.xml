The Ansible collection "ibm.ibm_zhmc" writes password-like properties in clear text into its log file and into the output returned by some of its Ansible module in the following cases: 1. The 'boot_ftp_password' and 'ssc_master_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc_partition Ansible module. 2. The 'ssc_master_pw' and 'zaware_master_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc_lpar Ansible module. 3. The 'password' property is passed as input to the zhmc_user Ansible module (just in log file, not in module output). 4. The 'bind_password' property is passed as input to the zhmc_ldap_server_definition Ansible module. These properties appear in the module output only when they were specified in the module input and when creating or updating the corresponding resources. They do not appear in the output when retrieving facts for the corresponding resources. These properties appear in the log file only when the "log_file" module input parameter is used. By default, no log file is created. This issue has been fixed in ibm.ibm_zhmc version 1.9.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:58:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53980 | Spoofed length byte traps CC2538 in endless loop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53980</link><description>RIOT is an open-source microcontroller operating system, designed to match the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other embedded devices. A malicious actor can send a IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which eventually results into an endless loop on a CC2538 as receiver. Before PR #20998, the receiver would check for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This then results into reading outside of the RX FIFO.  Although it prints an error when attempting to read outside of the RX FIFO, it will continue doing this. This may lead to a discrepancy in the CRC check according to the firmware and the radio. If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:58:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53983 | Server-side request forgery in Backstage Scaffolder plugin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53983</link><description>The Backstage Scaffolder plugin Houses types and utilities for building scaffolder-related modules. A vulnerability is identified in Backstage Scaffolder template functionality where Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) can be exploited to perform Git config injection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture privileged git tokens used by the Backstage Scaffolder plugin. With these tokens, unauthorized access to sensitive resources in git can be achieved. The impact is considered medium severity as the Backstage Threat Model recommends restricting access to adding and editing templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin. The issue has been resolved in versions `v0.4.12`, `v0.5.1` and `v0.6.1` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` package. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may ensure that templates do not change git config.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:58:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36611 | In Symfony v7.07, a security vulnerability was identified in the FormLoginAuthenticator component, where it failed to adequately handle case...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36611</link><description>In Symfony v7.07, a security vulnerability was identified in the FormLoginAuthenticator component, where it failed to adequately handle cases where the username or password field of a login request is empty.

An incorrect string comparison is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `"acb"` being accepted for `"_abc_"`. This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the "iss" claim changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer, Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string comparison. This results in `if "abc" not in "__abcd__":` being checked instead of `if "abc" != "__abc__":`. Signature checks are still present so real world impact is likely limited to denial of service scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All users are advised to upgrade.

The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache, or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file, as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json`</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:41:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52003 | X-Forwarded-Prefix Header still allows for Open Redirect in traefik</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52003</link><description>Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.

But, REST-APIs are unexpectedly enabled when the affected product is powered up, provided either http-server (GUI) or Web authentication is enabled. The factory default configuration makes http-server (GUI) enabled, which means REST-APIs are also enabled. The username and the password for REST-APIs are configured in the factory default configuration. As a result, an attacker may obtain and/or alter the affected product's settings via REST-APIs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 09:21:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11013 | Command Injection vulnerability in NEC Corporation UNIVERGE IX from Ver9.2 to Ver10.10.21, for Ver10.8 up to Ver10.8.27, for Ver10.9 up to V...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11013</link><description>Command Injection vulnerability in NEC Corporation UNIVERGE IX from Ver9.2 to Ver10.10.21, for Ver10.8 up to Ver10.8.27, for Ver10.9 up to Ver10.9.14 and UNIVERGE IX-R/IX-V Ver1.2.15 and earlier allows a attacker to inject an arbitrary CLI commands to be executed on the device via the management interface.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 08:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11014 | Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in NEC Corporation UNIVERGE IX from Ver9.2 to Ver10.10.21, for Ver10.8 up to Ver10.8.27 and ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11014</link><description>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in NEC Corporation UNIVERGE IX from Ver9.2 to Ver10.10.21, for Ver10.8 up to Ver10.8.27 and for Ver10.9 up to Ver10.9.14 allows a attacker to hijack the authentication of screens on the device via the management interface.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 08:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9044 | XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability in EasyTax</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9044</link><description>A XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability has been identified in Easy Tax Client Software 2023 1.2 and earlier across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 07:45:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11481 | A vulnerability in ESM 11.6.10 allows unauthenticated access to the internal Snowservice API.
