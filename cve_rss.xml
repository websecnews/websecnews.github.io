Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker’s access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59411 | CubeCart Stored/Reflected HTML Injection Vulnerability in Contact Enquiry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59411</link><description>CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, the contact form’s Enquiry field accepts raw HTML and that HTML is included verbatim in the email sent to the store admin. By submitting HTML in the Enquiry, the admin receives an email containing that HTML. This indicates user input is not being escaped or sanitized before being output in email (and possibly when re-rendering the form), leading to Cross-Site Scripting / HTML injection risk in email clients or admin UI. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59412 | CubeCart Vulnerable to HTML Injection in Product Reviews Allows Malicious Links and Defacement</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59412</link><description>CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field. Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display unwanted content. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59413 | CubeCart Unauthorized Newsletter Unsubscription via force_unsubscribe Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59413</link><description>CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, a logic flaw exists in the newsletter subscription endpoint that allows an attacker to unsubscribe any user without their consent. By changing the value of the force_unsubscribe parameter in the POST request to 1, an attacker can force the removal of any valid subscriber’s email address. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10805 | Campcodes Online Beauty Parlor Management System add-services.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10805</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in Campcodes Online Beauty Parlor Management System 1.0.

When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:32:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57602 | Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH priv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57602</link><description>Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH private key, allows remote attackers to authenticate to the cloud controller, gain interactive shell access, and pivot into other connected IoT devices.

The default session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with a counter, the epoch time, the built-in rand function, the PID, and internal Perl reference addresses. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 12:45:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10741 | Selleo Mentingo Profile Picture unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10741</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in Selleo Mentingo up to 2025.08.27.
