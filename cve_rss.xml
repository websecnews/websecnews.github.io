A command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119, the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from `$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` by default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP. Commit 53e8014d1f082034e0646edc6286cde3800c683d contains a patch for the issue, but this commit was reverted in commit 99633903cad0de5ace636249de16f77e57a3c8fc.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 14:40:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29894 | Cacti Cross-site Scripting vulnerability when using JavaScript based messaging API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29894</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Versions of Cacti prior to 1.2.27 contain a residual cross-site scripting vulnerability caused by an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-50250. `raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js to fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others). However, it still generates the code out of unescaped PHP variables `$title` and `$header`. If those variables contain single quotes, they can be used to inject JavaScript code. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings. Version 1.2.27 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 14:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34459 | An issue was discovered in xmllint (from libxml2) before 2.11.8 and 2.12.x before 2.12.7.

Versions of Cacti prior to 1.2.27 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, a type of cross-site scripting where malicious scripts are permanently stored on a target server and served to users who access a particular page. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:59:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28866 | GoCD vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting possible on server loading page during start-up</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28866</link><description>GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:59:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25641 | Cacti RCE vulnerability when importing packages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25641</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable through the "Package Import" feature, allows authenticated users having the "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:39:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4819 | Campcodes Online Laundry Management System admin_class.php improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4819</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Campcodes Online Laundry Management System 1.0.

When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 12:38:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25581 | Transfer requests received over DoH can lead to a denial of service in DNSdist</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25581</link><description>When incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 provider, and queries are routed to a tcp-only or DNS over TLS backend, an attacker can trigger an assertion failure in DNSdist by sending a request for a zone transfer (AXFR or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing the process to stop and thus leading to a Denial of Service.

Bluetooth: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by sco_sock_timeout

When the sco connection is established and then, the sco socket
is releasing, timeout_work will be scheduled to judge whether
the sco disconnection is timeout. The sock will be deallocated
later, but it is dereferenced again in sco_sock_timeout. As a
result, the use-after-free bugs will happen. The root cause is
shown below:

    Cleanup Thread               |      Worker Thread
sco_sock_release                 |

Bluetooth: l2cap: fix null-ptr-deref in l2cap_chan_timeout

There is a race condition between l2cap_chan_timeout() and
l2cap_chan_del(). When we use l2cap_chan_del() to delete the
channel, the chan-&gt;conn will be set to null. But the conn could
be dereferenced again in the mutex_lock() of l2cap_chan_timeout().
As a result the null pointer dereference bug will happen. The
KASAN report triggered by POC is shown below:

drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2

This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move
on same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old
location is simply not available any more.

Some fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the move
notification before actually moving things because only this way we have
the correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.

Also rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the eviction
counter before the move.

usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit

If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()
as length will wrap around ending up as some very
large value.

The driver will then proceed to parse the header
located at that position, which will either oops or
process some random value.

The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
since the introduction of the driver.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35167 | WordPress Envo&amp;#x27;s Elementor Templates &amp;amp; Widgets for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;=1.4.8 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35167</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in EnvoThemes Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.4.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35169 | WordPress All Bootstrap Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.15 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35169</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in AREOI All Bootstrap Blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects All Bootstrap Blocks: from n/a through 1.3.15.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4067 | Regular Expression Denial of Service in micromatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4067</link><description>The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4068 | Memory Exhaustion in braces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4068</link><description>The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion.
