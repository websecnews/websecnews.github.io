Smolder 1.51 and earlier for Perl uses the rand() function as the default source of entropy, which is not cryptographically secure, for cryptographic functions.

Specifically Smolder::DB::Developer uses the Data::Random library which specifically states that it is "Useful mostly for test programs". Data::Random uses the rand() function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:02:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69251 | free5GC has Improper Input Validation in UDM, Leading to Information Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69251</link><description>free5gc UDM provides Unified Data Management (UDM) for free5GC, an open-source project for 5th generation (5G) mobile core networks.

When these services are exposed to an untrusted network in a client-managed deployment, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution. Version 2021.2.4 is no longer supported by Fiserv. Customers should upgrade to a currently supported release (2025.1 or later) and ensure that .NET Remoting service ports are not exposed beyond trusted network boundaries.

This CVE documents behavior observed in a client-hosted deployment running an unsupported legacy version of Originate Loans Peripherals with .NET Remoting ports exposed to an untrusted network. This is not a default or supported configuration. Customers running legacy versions should upgrade to a currently supported release and ensure .NET Remoting ports are restricted to trusted network segments. The finding does not apply to Fiserv-hosted environments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 23:08:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-3061 | Out of bounds read in Media in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.116 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-3061</link><description>Out of bounds read in Media in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.116 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a crafted HTML page.

The Camel-Keycloak KeycloakSecurityPolicy does not validate the iss (issuer) claim of JWT tokens against the configured realm. A token issued by one Keycloak realm is silently accepted by a policy configured for a completely different realm, breaking tenant isolation.
This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.

The Camel-LevelDB DefaultLevelDBSerializer class deserializes data read from the LevelDB aggregation repository using java.io.ObjectInputStream without applying any ObjectInputFilter or class-loading restrictions. An attacker who can write to the LevelDB database files used by a Camel application can inject a crafted serialized Java object that, when deserialized during normal aggregation repository operations, results in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.8, from 4.14.0 before 4.14.5, from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.0, which fixes the issue. For the 4.10.x LTS releases, users are recommended to upgrade to 4.10.9, while for 4.14.x LTS releases, users are recommended to upgrade to 4.14.5</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 09:31:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2981 | UTT HiPER 810G formTaskEdit_ap strcpy buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2981</link><description>A vulnerability was found in UTT HiPER 810G up to 1.7.7-1711.

This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file shared_prefs/aliasvault.xml of the component Backup Handler. The manipulation of the argument accessToken/refreshToken/metadata/key_derivation_params/auth_methods leads to exposure of backup file to an unauthorized control sphere. An attack has to be approached locally. The attack is considered to have high complexity. It is stated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. Upgrading to version 0.26.0 is able to resolve this issue. The identifier of the patch is 873ecc03f92238e162f98a068ad56069a922b4f6/0bd662320174d8265dfe3b05a04bc13efc960532. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The creator of the software explains: "Because of AliasVault's zero-knowledge encryption design, the tokens stored in aliasvault.xml are API session tokens that cannot decrypt the vault on their own: the master password is required for that. So while this isn't a direct vault compromise risk, there's no reason to include them in backups either."</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 06:46:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2972 | a466350665 Smart-SSO Role Edit UserController.java save cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2972</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in a466350665 Smart-SSO up to 2.1.1.
