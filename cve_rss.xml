Configuration supplied through APP_CONFIG_* environment variables, for example APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port=7007, where unexpectedly ignoring the visibility defined in configuration schema. This occurred even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration, but now clearly goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend package. As a temporary measure, avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration pattern. Consider alternative methods for setting secrets, such as the environment substitution available for Backstage configuration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7824 | Type-confusion vulnerability that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7824</link><description>Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrUrl.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7825 | Type confusion that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7825</link><description>Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrUrl.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7826 | Unhandled exception vulnerability that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7826</link><description>Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrURL.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0125 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the nvdisam command line tool, where a user can cause a NULL pointer d...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0125</link><description>NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the nvdisam command line tool, where a user can cause a NULL pointer dereference by running nvdisasm on a malformed ELF file.

Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 16:40:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45870 | Bandisoft BandiView 7.05 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control in sub_0x3d80fc via a crafted POC file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45870</link><description>Bandisoft BandiView 7.05 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control in sub_0x3d80fc via a crafted POC file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 16:16:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25590 | Crafted responses can lead to a denial of service due to cache inefficiencies in the Recursor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25590</link><description>An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record Sets.

The Pomerium databroker service is responsible for managing all persistent Pomerium application state. Requests to the databroker service API are authorized by the presence of a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by a key known by all Pomerium services in the same deployment. However, incomplete validation of this JWT meant that some service account access tokens would incorrectly be treated as valid for the purpose of databroker API authorization. Improper access to the databroker API could allow exfiltration of user info, spoofing of user sessions, or tampering with Pomerium routes, policies, and other settings. A Pomerium deployment is susceptible to this issue if all of the following conditions are met, you have issued a service account access token using Pomerium Zero or Pomerium Enterprise, the access token has an explicit expiration date in the future, and the core Pomerium databroker gRPC API is not otherwise secured by network access controls.

If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that don't exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do argument injection or directory traversal attacks.

This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum.  It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value.  This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 18:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31835 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in flatpress CMS Flatpress v1.3 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31835</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in flatpress CMS Flatpress v1.3 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the file name parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 17:30:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47608 | Logicytics vulnerable to shell injections</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47608</link><description>Logicytics is designed to harvest and collect data for forensic analysis.
