Starting in 7.2-milestone-2 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in XWiki discloses the password hashes of all users to anyone with view right on the respective user profiles. By default, all user profiles are public. This vulnerability also affects any configurations used by extensions that contain passwords like API keys that are viewable for the attacker. Normally, such passwords aren't accessible but this vulnerability would disclose them as plain text.  This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 19:18:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50720 | XWiki Platform Solr search discloses email addresses of users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50720</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in XWiki discloses the email addresses of users even when obfuscation of email addresses is enabled. To demonstrate the vulnerability, search for `objcontent:email*` using XWiki's regular search interface. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1 by not indexing email address properties when obfuscation is enabled. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 19:18:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50721 | XWiki Platform RCE from account through SearchAdmin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50721</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 4.5-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the search administration interface doesn't properly escape the id and label of search user interface extensions, allowing the injection of XWiki syntax containing script macros including Groovy macros that allow remote code execution, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki instance. This attack can be executed by any user who can edit some wiki page like the user's profile (editable by default) as user interface extensions that will be displayed in the search administration can be added on any document by any user.

Starting in 2.3 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, there is a reflected XSS or also direct remote code execution vulnerability in the code for displaying configurable admin sections. The code that can be passed through a URL parameter is only executed when the user who is visiting the crafted URL has edit right on at least one configuration section. While any user of the wiki could easily create such a section, this vulnerability doesn't require the attacker to have an account or any access on the wiki. It is sufficient to trick any admin user of the XWiki installation to visit the crafted URL. This vulnerability allows full remote code execution with programming rights and thus impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. The patch can be manually applied to the document `XWiki.ConfigurableClass`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 19:18:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50723 | XWiki Platform remote code execution/programming rights with configuration section from any user account</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50723</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 2.3 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, anyone who can edit an arbitrary wiki page in an XWiki installation can gain programming right through several cases of missing escaping in the code for displaying sections in the administration interface. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. Normally, all users are allowed to edit their own user profile so this should be exploitable by all users of the XWiki instance. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. The patches can be manually applied to the `XWiki.ConfigurableClassMacros` and `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` pages.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 19:18:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50918 | app/Controller/AuditLogsController.php in MISP before 2.4.182 mishandles ACLs for audit logs.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50918</link><description>app/Controller/AuditLogsController.php in MISP before 2.4.182 mishandles ACLs for audit logs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 17:36:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50917 | MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) before 0662e5e allows command execution via thumb.php shell metacharacters.

However, there is no check on the compilation parameters of Maven. allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.2

Example:

##You can customize the splicing method according to the compilation situation of the project, mvn compilation results use &amp;&amp;, compilation failure use "||" or "&amp;&amp;":

/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml || rm -rf /*

  *  An IDP configured for federated authentication and JIT provisioning enabled with the "Prompt for username, password and consent" option.
  *  A service provider that uses the above IDP for federated authentication and has the "Assert identity using mapped local subject identifier" flag enabled.


Attacker should have:

  *  A fresh valid user account in the federated IDP that has not been used earlier.
  *  Knowledge of the username of a valid user in the local IDP.


When all preconditions are met, a malicious actor could use JIT provisioning flow to perform user impersonation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 09:47:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48395 | Kaifa Technology WebITR - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48395</link><description>Kaifa Technology WebITR is an online attendance system, it has insufficient validation for user input within a special function.

Prior to version 2023.12.3, the login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains a patch for this issue.

When starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release, the login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not authenticated and the request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet. The rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.

However, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 02:35:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-36878 | Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36878</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-40954 | A SQL injection vulnerability in Grzegorz Marczynski Dynamic Progress Bar (aka web_progress) v. 11.0 through 11.0.2, v12.0 through v12.0.2, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40954</link><description>A SQL injection vulnerability in Grzegorz Marczynski Dynamic Progress Bar (aka web_progress) v. 11.0 through 11.0.2, v12.0 through v12.0.2, v.13.0 through v13.0.2, v.14.0 through v14.0.2.1, v.15.0 through v15.0.2, and v16.0 through v16.0.2.1 allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via the recency parameter in models/web_progress.py component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42183 | lockss-daemon (aka Classic LOCKSS Daemon) before 1.77.3 performs post-Unicode normalization, which may allow bypass of intended access restr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42183</link><description>lockss-daemon (aka Classic LOCKSS Daemon) before 1.77.3 performs post-Unicode normalization, which may allow bypass of intended access restrictions, such as when U+1FEF is converted to a backtick.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48050 | SQL injection vulnerability in Cams Biometrics Zkteco, eSSL, Cams Biometrics Integration Module with HR Attendance (aka odoo-biometric-atten...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48050</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Cams Biometrics Zkteco, eSSL, Cams Biometrics Integration Module with HR Attendance (aka odoo-biometric-attendance) v. 13.0 through 16.0.1 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and to gain privileges via the db parameter in the controllers/controllers.py component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6831 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27; in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6831</link><description>Path Traversal: '\..\filename' in GitHub repository mlflow/mlflow prior to 2.9.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6832 | Business Logic Errors in microweber/microweber</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6832</link><description>Business Logic Errors in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 2.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
