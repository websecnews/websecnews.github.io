In versions 0.9.9 through 0.22.0, when performing aggregate queries, Ormar ORM constructs SQL expressions by passing user-supplied column names directly into `sqlalchemy.text()` without any validation or sanitization. The `min()` and `max()` methods in the `QuerySet` class accept arbitrary string input as the column parameter. While `sum()` and `avg()` are partially protected by an `is_numeric` type check that rejects non-existent fields, `min()` and `max()` skip this validation entirely. As a result, an attacker-controlled string is embedded as raw SQL inside the aggregate function call. Any unauthorized user can exploit this vulnerability to read the entire database contents, including tables unrelated to the queried model, by injecting a subquery as the column parameter. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26283 | ImageMagick has possible infinite loop in JPEG encoder when using `jpeg:extent`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26283</link><description>ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a `continue` statement in the JPEG extent binary search loop in the jpeg encoder causes an infinite loop when writing persistently fails. An attacker can trigger a 100% CPU consumption and process hang (Denial of Service) with a crafted image.

Starting in version 2023.06.21 and prior to version 2026.02.21, when yt-dlp's `--netrc-cmd` command-line option (or `netrc_cmd` Python API parameter) is used, an attacker could achieve arbitrary command injection on the user's system with a maliciously crafted URL. yt-dlp maintainers assume the impact of this vulnerability to be high for anyone who uses `--netrc-cmd` in their command/configuration or `netrc_cmd` in their Python scripts. Even though the maliciously crafted URL itself will look very suspicious to many users, it would be trivial for a maliciously crafted webpage with an inconspicuous URL to covertly exploit this vulnerability via HTTP redirect. Users without `--netrc-cmd` in their arguments or `netrc_cmd` in their scripts are unaffected. No evidence has been found of this exploit being used in the wild. yt-dlp version 2026.02.21 fixes this issue by validating all netrc "machine" values and raising an error upon unexpected input. As a workaround, users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using the `--netrc-cmd` command-line option (or `netrc_cmd` Python API parameter), or they should at least not pass a placeholder (`{}`) in their `--netrc-cmd` argument.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26981 | OpenEXR has heap-buffer-overflow via signed integer underflow in ImfContextInit.cpp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26981</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.3.0 through 3.3.6 and 3.4.0 through 3.4.4, a heap-buffer-overflow (OOB read) occurs in the `istream_nonparallel_read` function in `ImfContextInit.cpp` when parsing a malformed EXR file through a memory-mapped `IStream`. A signed integer subtraction produces a negative value that is implicitly converted to `size_t`, resulting in a massive length being passed to `memcpy`. Versions 3.3.7 and 3.4.5 contain a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26983 | ImageMagick: Invalid MSL &amp;lt;map&amp;gt; can result in a use after free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26983</link><description>ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images.

In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `editableTable.twig` component when using the `html` column type. The application fails to sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript when another user views a page with the malicious table field. In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have an administrator account, and `allowAdminChanges` must be enabled in production, which is against Craft's security recommendations. Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27127 | Craft CMS has Cloud Metadata SSRF Protection Bypass via DNS Rebinding</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27127</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, the SSRF validation in Craft CMS’s GraphQL Asset mutation performs DNS resolution separately from the HTTP request. This Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability enables DNS rebinding attacks, where an attacker’s DNS server returns different IP addresses for validation compared to the actual request. This is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437 that allows access to all blocked IPs, not just IPv6 endpoints. Exploitation requires GraphQL schema permissions for editing assets in the `&lt;VolumeName&gt;` volume and creating assets in the `&lt;VolumeName&gt;` volume. These permissions may be granted to authenticated users with appropriate GraphQL schema access and/or Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions). Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27128 | Craft CMS&amp;#x27;s race condition in Token Service potentially allows for token usage greater than the token limit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27128</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists in Craft CMS’s token validation service for tokens that explicitly set a limited usage. The `getTokenRoute()` method reads a token’s usage count, checks if it’s within limits, then updates the database in separate non-atomic operations. By sending concurrent requests, an attacker can use a single-use impersonation token multiple times before the database update completes. To make this work, an attacker needs to obtain a valid user account impersonation URL with a non-expired token via some other means and exploit a race condition while bypassing any rate-limiting rules in place. For this to be a privilege escalation, the impersonation URL must include a token for a user account with more permissions than the current user. Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27129 | Cloud Metadata SSRF Protection Bypass via IPv6 Resolution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27129</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, the SSRF validation in Craft CMS’s GraphQL Asset mutation uses `gethostbyname()`, which only resolves IPv4 addresses. When a hostname has only AAAA (IPv6) records, the function returns the hostname string itself, causing the blocklist comparison to always fail and completely bypassing SSRF protection. This is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437. Exploitation requires GraphQL schema permissions for editing assets in the `&lt;VolumeName&gt;` volume and creating assets in the `&lt;VolumeName&gt;` volume. These permissions may be granted to authenticated users with appropriate GraphQL schema access and/or Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions). Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-3054 | Alinto SOGo cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-3054</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in Alinto SOGo 5.12.3/5.12.4.

Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, ImageMagick’s path security policy is enforced on the raw filename string before the filesystem resolves it. As a result, a policy rule such as /etc/* can be bypassed by a path traversal. The OS resolves the traversal and opens the sensitive file, but the policy matcher only sees the unnormalized path and therefore allows the read. This enables local file disclosure (LFI) even when policy-secure.xml is applied. Actions to prevent reading from files have been taken in versions .7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 But it make sure writing is also not possible the following should be added to one's policy. This will also be included in ImageMagick's more secure policies by default.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25966 | ImageMagick&amp;#x27;s Security Policy Bypass through config/policy-secure.xml via &amp;quot;fd handler&amp;quot; leads to stdin/stdout access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25966</link><description>ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. The shipped "secure" security policy includes a rule intended to prevent reading/writing from standard streams. However, ImageMagick also supports fd:&lt;n&gt; pseudo-filenames (e.g., fd:0, fd:1). Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, this path form is not blocked by the secure policy templates, and therefore bypasses the protection goal of "no stdin/stdout." Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch by including a change to the more secure policies by default. As a workaround, add the change to one's security policy manually.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25967 | ImageMagick has stack buffer overflow in FTXT reader via oversized integer field</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25967</link><description>ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images.

In versions 9.0.0 through 9.5.3, Astro server actions have no default request body size limit, which can lead to memory exhaustion DoS. A single large POST to a valid action endpoint can crash the server process on memory-constrained deployments. On-demand rendered sites built with Astro can define server actions, which automatically parse incoming request bodies (JSON or FormData). The body is buffered entirely into memory with no size limit — a single oversized request is sufficient to exhaust the process heap and crash the server. Astro's Node adapter (`mode: 'standalone'`) creates an HTTP server with no body size protection. In containerized environments, the crashed process is automatically restarted, and repeated requests cause a persistent crash-restart loop. Action names are discoverable from HTML form attributes on any public page, so no authentication is required. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated denial of service against SSR standalone deployments using server actions. A single oversized request crashes the server process, and repeated requests cause a persistent crash-restart loop in containerized environments. Version 9.5.4 contains a fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:54:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-3050 | horilla-opensource horilla Leads global.js cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-3050</link><description>A flaw has been found in horilla-opensource horilla up to 1.0.2.

Prior to version 9.5.4, Server-Side Rendered pages that return an error with a prerendered custom error page (eg. `404.astro` or `500.astro`) are vulnerable to SSRF. If the `Host:` header is changed to an attacker's server, it will be fetched on `/500.html` and they can redirect this to any internal URL to read the response body through the first request. An attacker who can access the application without `Host:` header validation (eg. through finding the origin IP behind a proxy, or just by default) can fetch their own server to redirect to any internal IP. With this they can fetch cloud metadata IPs and interact with services in the internal network or localhost. For this to be vulnerable, a common feature needs to be used, with direct access to the server (no proxies).

When these services are exposed to an untrusted network in a client-managed deployment, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution. Version 2021.2.4 is no longer supported by Fiserv. Customers should upgrade to a currently supported release (2025.1 or later) and ensure that .NET Remoting service ports are not exposed beyond trusted network boundaries.

This CVE documents behavior observed in a client-hosted deployment running an unsupported legacy version of Originate Loans Peripherals with .NET Remoting ports exposed to an untrusted network. This is not a default or supported configuration. Customers running legacy versions should upgrade to a currently supported release and ensure .NET Remoting ports are restricted to trusted network segments. The finding does not apply to Fiserv-hosted environments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 23:08:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-3061 | Out of bounds read in Media in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.116 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-3061</link><description>Out of bounds read in Media in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.116 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a crafted HTML page.
