In versions 0.2.0 and below, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds HTTP endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints, /inspector/graph/interact, accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 23:48:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54790 | Files: Potential for SQL Injection through File Browse and List Operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54790</link><description>Files is a module for managing files inside spaces and user profiles.

In versions 1.2.4 and below, attackers can achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the target's machine. Once a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP, the attacker can silently swap it for a malicious command (e.g., calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt. If an attacker has write permissions on a user's active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or allows an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.

In versions below 1.3, Mermaid (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server.

In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability in the software's discovery protocol allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same local network to impersonate legitimate devices, silently intercepting, reading, and modifying any file transfer. This can be used to steal sensitive data or inject malware, like ransomware, into files shared between trusted users. The attack is hardly detectable and easy to implement, posing a severe and immediate security risk.

Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 16:22:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52390 | Saurus CMS Community Edition since commit d886e5b0 (2010-04-23) is vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `prepareSearchQuery()`...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-52390</link><description>Saurus CMS Community Edition since commit d886e5b0 (2010-04-23) is vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `prepareSearchQuery()` method in `FulltextSearch.class.php`.

In certain versions (notably 4.1 and 5.0RC1), the pandora user can elevate privileges to root without a password using a chain involving the artica user account. This account is typically installed without a password and is configured to run sudo without authentication.

If file uploads are enabled on the server, the attacker can upload a web shell and gain remote code execution with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full system compromise.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:28:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34146 | nyariv sandboxjs 0.8.23 Prototype Pollution Sandbox Escape DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34146</link><description>A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in @nyariv/sandboxjs versions &lt;= 0.8.23, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into Object.prototype via crafted JavaScript code. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, under certain conditions, escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict code execution.

The flaw allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the dates[] POST parameter, enabling file write via INTO OUTFILE under specific environmental conditions. This can lead to remote code execution by writing a PHP payload to the web-accessible temporary directory. The vulnerability has been confirmed in versions including 0.9.2.beta, 0.9.2.1294.beta, and 0.9.2.1306-3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:59:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2013-10034 | Kaseya &amp;lt; 6.3.0.2 uploadImage.asp Arbitrary File Upload RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-10034</link><description>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in Kaseya KServer versions prior to 6.3.0.2. The uploadImage.asp endpoint allows unauthenticated users to upload files to arbitrary paths via a crafted filename parameter in a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to the lack of authentication and input sanitation, an attacker can upload a file with an .asp extension to a web-accessible directory, which can then be invoked to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IUSR account. The vulnerability enables remote code execution without prior authentication and was resolved in version 6.3.0.2 by removing the vulnerable uploadImage.asp endpoint.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:59:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2013-10036 | Beetel Connection Manager NetConfig.ini Stack-Based Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-10036</link><description>A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Beetel Connection Manager version PCW_BTLINDV1.0.0B04 when parsing the UserName parameter in the NetConfig.ini configuration file.

The devices ship with a default SSH login or a hardcoded DSA private key, allowing an attacker to authenticate remotely with limited privileges.


Once authenticated, an attacker can overwrite the world-writable /ca/bin/monitor.sh script with arbitrary commands. Since this script is executed with elevated privileges through the backend binary, enabling the debug monitor via backend -c "debug monitor on" triggers execution of the attacker's payload as root. This allows full system compromise.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:59:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2014-125125 | A10 Networks AX Loadbalancer Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-125125</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in A10 Networks AX Loadbalancer versions 2.6.1-GR1-P5, 2.7.0, and earlier. The vulnerability resides in the handling of the filename parameter in the /xml/downloads endpoint, which fails to properly sanitize user input. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences to read arbitrary files outside the intended directory. The files returned by the vulnerable endpoint are deleted from the system after retrieval.
