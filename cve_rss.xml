In 1.3.11 and earlier, a critical heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Nav2 AMCL's particle filter clustering logic. By publishing a single crafted geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped message with extreme covariance values to the /initialpose topic, an unauthenticated attacker on the same ROS 2 DDS domain can trigger a negative index write (set-&gt;clusters[-1]) into heap memory preceding the allocated buffer. In Release builds, the sole boundary check (assert) is compiled out, leaving zero runtime protection. This primitive allows controlled corruption of the heap chunk metadata(at least the size of the heap chunk where the set-&gt;clusters is in is controllable by the attacker), potentially leading to further exploitation. At minimum, it provides a reliable single-packet denial of service that kills localization and halts all navigation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:18:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26020 | AutoGPT Affected by Remote Code Execution via Dynamic Module Import in Block Loading (__import__)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26020</link><description>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.48, an authenticated user could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server by embedding a disabled block inside a graph.

Prior to 5.5.3 - #45, in Clip Bucket V5, The Remote Play allows creating video entries that reference external video URLs without uploading the video files to the server. However, by specifying an internal network host in the video URL, an SSRF can be triggered, causing GET requests to be sent to internal servers. An attacker can exploit this to scan the internal network.

String fields from eBPF events in columns output mode are rendered to the terminal without any sanitization of control characters or ANSI escape sequences. Therefore, a maliciously forged – partially or completely – event payload, coming from an observed container, might inject the escape sequences into the terminal of ig operators, with various effects. The columns output mode is the default when running ig run interactively.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 20:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25933 | Arduino App Lab has Improper Data Validation in Internal Terminal Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25933</link><description>Arduino App Lab is a cross-platform IDE for developing Arduino Apps. Prior to 0.4.0, a vulnerability was identified in the Terminal component of the arduino-app-lab application. The issue stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of input data received from connected hardware devices, specifically in the _info.Serial and _info.Address metadata fields. The problem occurs during device information handling. When a board is connected, the application collects identifying attributes to establish a terminal session. Because strict validation is not enforced for the Serial and Address parameters, an attacker with control over the connected hardware can supply specially crafted strings containing shell metacharacters. The exploitation requires direct physical access to a previously tampered board. When the host system processes these fields, any injected payload is executed with the privileges of the user running arduino-app-lab. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 20:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25949 | Traefik: TCP readTimeout bypass via STARTTLS on Postgres</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25949</link><description>Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.

Prior to 17.0.5 and 16.0.17, FreePBX module api (PBX API) is vulnerable to privilege escalation by authenticated users with REST/GraphQL API access. This vulnerability allows an attacker to forge a valid JWT with full access to the REST and GraphQL APIs on a FreePBX that they've already connected to, possibly as a lower privileged user. The JWT is signed using the api-oauth.key private key. An attacker can generate their own token if they possess this key (e.g., by accessing an affected instance), and specify any scopes they wish (e.g., rest, gql), bypassing traditional authorization checks. However, FreePBX enforces that the jti (JWT ID) claim must exist in the database (api_access_tokens table in the asterisk MySQL database) in order for the token to be accepted. Therefore, the attacker must know a jti value that already exists on the target instance. This vulnerability is fixed in 17.0.5 and 16.0.17.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61880 | In Infoblox NIOS through 9.0.7, insecure deserialization can result in remote code execution.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61880</link><description>In Infoblox NIOS through 9.0.7, insecure deserialization can result in remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56647 | npm @farmfe/core before 1.7.6 is Missing Origin Validation in WebSocket.

The `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).

### Details
When the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.

**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):
```js
if (val &amp;&amp; typeof val === 'string' &amp;&amp; options.comma &amp;&amp; val.indexOf(',') &gt; -1) {
    return val.split(',');
}

if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded &amp;&amp; currentArrayLength &gt;= options.arrayLimit) {
    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');
}

return val;
```
The `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).

### PoC
**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**
```
npm install qs
```

```js
const qs = require('qs');

const payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)
const options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };

try {
  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);
  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown
}
```
**Configuration:**
- `comma: true`
- `arrayLimit: 5`
- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`

Expected: Throws "Array limit exceeded" error.
Actual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.

Prior to 1.1.14, the RecursiveUrlLoader class in @langchain/community is a web crawler that recursively follows links from a starting URL. Its preventOutside option (enabled by default) is intended to restrict crawling to the same site as the base URL. The implementation used String.startsWith() to compare URLs, which does not perform semantic URL validation. An attacker who controls content on a crawled page could include links to domains that share a string prefix with the target, causing the crawler to follow links to attacker-controlled or internal infrastructure. Additionally, the crawler performed no validation against private or reserved IP addresses. A crawled page could include links targeting cloud metadata services, localhost, or RFC 1918 addresses, and the crawler would fetch them without restriction. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.14.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 21:56:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26021 | Prototype pollution in set-in</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26021</link><description>set-in provides the set value of nested associative structure given array of keys.

The EventErrStr buffer has a fixed size of 256 bytes. The code uses sprintf to format two filenames (Source1Filename and the string returned by FileUtil_FileStateStr) into this buffer without any length checking and without using bounded format specifiers such as %.*s. If the filename length approaches OS_MAX_PATH_LEN (commonly 64-256 bytes), the combined formatted string together with constant text can exceed 256 bytes, resulting in a stack buffer overflow. Such unsafe sprintf calls are scattered across multiple functions in file.c, including FILE_ConcatenateCmd() and ConcatenateFiles(), all of which fail to validate the output length.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:13:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0228 | PAN-OS: Improper Validation of Terminal Server Agent Certificate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0228</link><description>An improper certificate validation vulnerability in PAN-OS allows users to connect Terminal Server Agents on Windows to PAN-OS using expired certificates even if the PAN-OS configuration would not normally permit them to do so.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:13:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0229 | PAN-OS: Denial of Service in Advanced DNS Security Feature</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0229</link><description>A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the Advanced DNS Security (ADNS) feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables an unauthenticated attacker to initiate system reboots using a maliciously crafted packet.

Prior to 46.0.5, the public_key_from_numbers (or EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()), EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key(), load_der_public_key() and load_pem_public_key() functions do not verify that the point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup of the curve. This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point P from a small-order subgroup. This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as S = [victim_private_key]P via ECDH, this leaks information about victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order). For curves with cofactor &gt; 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key. When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup. Only SECT curves are impacted by this.

The two Regex are used containing the corresponding dangerous patterns \s+[\s\S]*? and \s+(.*?). They share a common characteristic — the combination of two adjacent quantifiers that can match the same space character (\s). As a result, an attacker can supply a long sequence of space characters to trigger excessive regex backtracking, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.32.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:01:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12699 | ZOLL ePCR IOS Mobile Application Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12699</link><description>The ZOLL ePCR IOS application reflects unsanitized user input into a WebView. Attacker-controlled strings placed into PCR fields (run number, incident, call sign, notes) are interpreted as HTML/JS when the app prints or renders that content. In the proof of concept (POC), injected scripts return local file content, which would allow arbitrary local file reads from the app's runtime context. These local files contain device and user data within the ePCR medical application, and if exposed, would allow an attacker to access protected health information (PHI) or device telemetry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 21:12:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1495 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in AVEVA PI to CONNECT Agent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1495</link><description>The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow an attacker with Event Log Reader (S-1-5-32-573) privileges to obtain proxy details, including URL and proxy credentials, from the PI to CONNECT event log files.

From 0.5 to 0.5.17, local attacker can exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in munged (the MUNGE authentication daemon) to leak cryptographic key material from process memory. With the leaked key material, the attacker could forge arbitrary MUNGE credentials to impersonate any user (including root) to services that rely on MUNGE for authentication. The vulnerability allows a buffer overflow by sending a crafted message with an oversized address length field, corrupting munged's internal state and enabling extraction of the MAC subkey used for credential verification.

This issue affects Apache Shiro: from 1.*, 2.* before 2.0.7.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later, which fixes the issue.

Prior to Shiro 2.0.7, code paths for non-existent vs. existing users are different enough,
that a brute-force attack may be able to tell, by timing the requests only, determine if
the request failed because of a non-existent user vs. wrong password.

The most likely attack vector is a local attack only.

  *  Apache Druid
  *  Affected Versions: 0.17.0 through 35.x (all versions prior to 36.0.0)
  *  Prerequisites:  *  druid-basic-security extension enabled
  *  LDAP authenticator configured
  *  Underlying LDAP server permits anonymous bind                                                                                                                                                   






Vulnerability Description

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Apache Druid when using the druid-basic-security extension with LDAP authentication. If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous
binds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.

The vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. 

Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can:
  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster
  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources
  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data
  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges
  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    


Mitigation
 
Immediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                    
  *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server. This prevents the vulnerability from being exploitable and is the recommended immediate action.



Resolution
  *  Upgrade Apache Druid to version 36.0.0 or later, which includes fixes to properly reject anonymous LDAP bind attempts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24343 | Apache HertzBeat: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via Crafted XPath Expressions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24343</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection') vulnerability in Apache HertzBeat.
