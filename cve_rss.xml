When a specially crafted URL is visited, the router's web page renders the directory listing and executes arbitrary JavaScript embedded in the URL. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the page, executing JavaScript on the victim's browser, which could then be used for further malicious actions. The vulnerability was identified in the 1.0.6 Build 20231011 rel.85717(5553) version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 21:55:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57376 | Buffer Overflow vulnerability in D-Link DSR-150, DSR-150N, DSR-250, DSR-250N, DSR-500N, DSR-1000N from 3.13 to 3.17B901C allows unauthentica...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57376</link><description>Buffer Overflow vulnerability in D-Link DSR-150, DSR-150N, DSR-250, DSR-250N, DSR-500N, DSR-1000N from 3.13 to 3.17B901C allows unauthenticated users to execute remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 21:55:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29869 | Apache Hive: Credentials file created with non restrictive permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29869</link><description>Hive creates a credentials file to a temporary directory in the file system with permissions 644 by default when the file permissions are not set explicitly.

The com.dtexsystems.helper service, responsible for handling privileged operations within the macOS DTEX Event Forwarder agent, fails to implement critical client validation during XPC interprocess communication (IPC). Specifically, the service does not verify the code requirements, entitlements, security flags, or version of any client attempting to establish a connection. This lack of proper logic validation allows malicious actors to exploit the service's methods via unauthorized client connections, and escalate privileges to root by abusing the DTConnectionHelperProtocol protocol's submitQuery method over an unauthorized XPC connection.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 21:41:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0785 | ESAFENET CDG SysConfig.jsp cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0785</link><description>A vulnerability was found in ESAFENET CDG V5 and classified as problematic.

An attacker with an account on an affected CVAT instance is able to run arbitrary code in the context of the Nuclio function container. This vulnerability affects CVAT deployments that run any of the serverless functions of type tracker from the CVAT Git repository, namely TransT and SiamMask. Deployments with custom functions of type tracker may also be affected, depending on how they handle state serialization. If a function uses an unsafe serialization library such as pickle or jsonpickle, it's likely to be vulnerable. Upgrade to CVAT 2.26.0 or later. If you are unable to upgrade, shut down any instances of the TransT or SiamMask functions you're running.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 15:32:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23211 | Tandoor Recipes - SSTI - Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23211</link><description>Tandoor Recipes is an application for managing recipes, planning meals, and building shopping lists.

The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes this issue.

The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user, potentially leading to DDoS attack.
