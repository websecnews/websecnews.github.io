Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via "drive-by" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45671 | Frigate reflected XSS through `/&amp;lt;camera_name&amp;gt;` API endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45671</link><description>Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/&lt;camera_name&gt;` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-43798 | BigBlueButton Blind SSRF When Uploading Presentation (mitigation bypass)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43798</link><description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. BigBlueButton prior to versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This issue is a bypass of CVE-2023-33176. A patch in versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 disabled follow redirect at `httpclient.execute` since the software no longer has to follow it when using `finalUrl`. There are no known workarounds. We recommend upgrading to a patched version of BigBlueButton.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:37:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44397 | CloudExplorer Lite permission bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44397</link><description>CloudExplorer Lite is an open source, lightweight cloud management platform.
