The span POST parameter is concatenated into a system-level command without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an administrator to inject arbitrary shell operators and payloads. Successful exploitation grants RCE with the privileges of the web service (typically root), potentially leading to full system compromise or lateral movement. This vulnerability arises from inadequate input validation and improper handling of user-supplied data in backend command invocations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:39:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52122 | Freeform 5.0.0 to before 5.10.16, a plugin for CraftCMS, contains an Server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability, resulting in arbit...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-52122</link><description>Freeform 5.0.0 to before 5.10.16, a plugin for CraftCMS, contains an Server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability, resulting in arbitrary code injection for all users that have access to editing a form (submission title).</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:21:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43729 | Dell ThinOS 10, versions prior to 2508_10.0127, contains an Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability.

Prior to versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2 for ImageMagick's 32-bit build, a 32-bit integer overflow in the BMP encoder’s scanline-stride computation collapses bytes_per_line (stride) to a tiny value while the per-row writer still emits 3 × width bytes for 24-bpp images. The row base pointer advances using the (overflowed) stride, so the first row immediately writes past its slot and into adjacent heap memory with attacker-controlled bytes. This is a classic, powerful primitive for heap corruption in common auto-convert pipelines. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:31:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50974 | The Calamaris log exporter CGI (/cgi-bin/logs.cgi/calamaris.dat) in IPFire 2.29 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorp...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50974</link><description>The Calamaris log exporter CGI (/cgi-bin/logs.cgi/calamaris.dat) in IPFire 2.29 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating parameter values into a shell command.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of .LNK files. Crafted data in an .LNK file can cause hazardous content in the file to be invisible to a user who inspects the file via the Windows-provided user interface. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.

This could allow an attacker who has the authority to view the log files to illicitly acquire the recorded sensitive information. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.25.0. If upgrading is not possible, a temporary workaround involves reviewing access permissions for SQL error logs and strictly limiting access to prevent unauthorized users from viewing them.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:19:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57810 | jsPDF Parsing of Corrupt PNGs Leads to Potential Denial of Service (DoS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57810</link><description>jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript.

Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

According to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has "get-task-allow" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.

Versions 1.x.x and earlier contain a vulnerability where HTTPS requests to 127.0.0.1 bypass IP address filtering, while HTTP requests are correctly blocked. This allows attackers to potentially access internal HTTPS services running on localhost, bypassing the library's SSRF protection. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when the application accepts user-controlled URLs and internal services are only protected by network-level restrictions. This vulnerability has been fixed in request-filtering-agent version 2.0.0.

An user with MODIFY permission ON ALL KEYSPACES can escalate privileges to superuser within a targeted Cassandra cluster via unsafe actions to a system resource. Operators granting data MODIFY permission on all keyspaces on affected versions should review data access rules for potential breaches.



This issue affects Apache Cassandra 3.0.30, 3.11.17, 4.0.16, 4.1.7, 5.0.2, but this advisory is only for 4.0.16 because the fix to CVE-2025-23015 was incorrectly applied to 4.0.16, so that version is still affected.

Users in the 4.0 series are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.17 which fixes the issue. Users from 3.0, 3.11, 4.1 and 5.0 series should follow recommendation from CVE-2025-23015.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29514 | Incorrect access control in the config.xgi function of D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 allows attackers to downloa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29514</link><description>Incorrect access control in the config.xgi function of D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 allows attackers to download the configuration file via providing a crafted web request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29515 | Incorrect access control in the DELT_file.xgi endpoint of D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 allows attackers to modi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29515</link><description>Incorrect access control in the DELT_file.xgi endpoint of D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 allows attackers to modify arbitrary settings within the device's XML database, including the administrator’s password.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29516 | D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the backup functio...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29516</link><description>D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the backup function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:19:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29517 | D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the traceroute6 fu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29517</link><description>D-Link DSL-7740C with firmware DSL7740C.V6.TR069.20211230 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the traceroute6 function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:19:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54370 | PhpSpreadsheet vulnerable to SSRF when reading and displaying a processed HTML document in the browser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54370</link><description>PhpOffice/PhpSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files.

                    curPos += ifread(&amp;amp;skew, 1, len,hdr);

In this case, the address of the newly-defined integer `skew` \[1\] is overflowed instead of `buf`. This means a stack overflow can occur using much smaller values of `len` in this code path.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:57:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54493 | A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54493</link><description>A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa).
