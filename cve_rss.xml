mm/vmalloc: fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL

commit a421ef303008 ("mm: allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc")
includes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commit
dd544141b9eb ("vmalloc: back off when the current task is OOM-killed").  A
possible scenario is as follows:

process-a
__vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL)
    __vmalloc_area_node()
        vm_area_alloc_pages()
		--&gt; oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a

To fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages()
if __GFP_NOFAIL set.

md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING

Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with
small possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commit
bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"")

However, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated
the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue
from raid5d().

Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:

1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear
   MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING;
2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;
3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;

This behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if other
context hold 'reconfig_mutex', and md_check_recovery() can't update
super_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until
'reconfig_mutex' is released.

Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by
skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after
md_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex'
is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 07:07:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39477 | mm/hugetlb: do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39477</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM

sysbot reported a splat [1] on __unmap_hugepage_range().  This is because
vma_needs_reservation() can return -ENOMEM if
allocate_file_region_entries() fails to allocate the file_region struct
for the reservation.

Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,
otherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any
file_regions.

If we detect that vma_needs_reservation() returned -ENOMEM, we clear the
hugetlb_restore_reserve flag as if this reservation was still consumed, so
free_huge_folio() will not increment the resv count.

drm/i915/hwmon: Get rid of devm

When both hwmon and hwmon drvdata (on which hwmon depends) are device
managed resources, the expectation, on device unbind, is that hwmon will be
released before drvdata. However, in i915 there are two separate code
paths, which both release either drvdata or hwmon and either can be
released before the other. These code paths (for device unbind) are as
follows (see also the bug referenced below):

unbind_store+0x9c/0xb0

This means that in i915, if use devm, we cannot gurantee that hwmon will
always be released before drvdata. Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon
sysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.

The only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free
everything explicitly during device unbind.

kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete

Currently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key, kdb
will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer.
Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the
destination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously
if the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor position, is in
the middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the supplied
buffer.

Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy()
calls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space
before we start moving characters around.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 07:07:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39481 | media: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39481</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iter

btree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a
fixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the
specific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of
size MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized
iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.

This patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits
the iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a
btree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length
data array.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 07:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39483 | KVM: SVM: WARN on vNMI + NMI window iff NMIs are outright masked</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39483</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: WARN on vNMI + NMI window iff NMIs are outright masked

When requesting an NMI window, WARN on vNMI support being enabled if and
only if NMIs are actually masked, i.e. if the vCPU is already handling an
NMI.  KVM's ABI for NMIs that arrive simultanesouly (from KVM's point of
view) is to inject one NMI and pend the other.  When using vNMI, KVM pends
the second NMI simply by setting V_NMI_PENDING, and lets the CPU do the
rest (hardware automatically sets V_NMI_BLOCKING when an NMI is injected).

However, if KVM can't immediately inject an NMI, e.g. because the vCPU is
in an STI shadow or is running with GIF=0, then KVM will request an NMI
window and trigger the WARN (but still function correctly).

Whether or not the GIF=0 case makes sense is debatable, as the intent of
KVM's behavior is to provide functionality that is as close to real
hardware as possible.  E.g. if two NMIs are sent in quick succession, the
probability of both NMIs arriving in an STI shadow is infinitesimally low
on real hardware, but significantly larger in a virtual environment, e.g.
if the vCPU is preempted in the STI shadow.  For GIF=0, the argument isn't
as clear cut, because the window where two NMIs can collide is much larger
in bare metal (though still small).

That said, KVM should not have divergent behavior for the GIF=0 case based
on whether or not vNMI support is enabled.  And KVM has allowed
simultaneous NMIs with GIF=0 for over a decade, since commit 7460fb4a3400
("KVM: Fix simultaneous NMIs").  I.e. KVM's GIF=0 handling shouldn't be
modified without a *really* good reason to do so, and if KVM's behavior
were to be modified, it should be done irrespective of vNMI support.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 07:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39484 | mmc: davinci: Don&amp;#x27;t strip remove function when driver is builtin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39484</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: davinci: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin

Using __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback being
discarded with CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y. When such a device gets unbound (e.g.
using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanup
being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in the
remove callback unconditionally.

xfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup

Commit a70f9fe52daa ("xfs: detect and handle invalid iclog size set by
mkfs") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initial
umount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9
("xfs: clean up calculation of LR header blocks") cleaned up the log
reover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size value
to size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of bounds
access when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs
tool, but a fuzzer.

Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size
into account for this calculation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 06:51:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52340 | The IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 6.3 has a net/ipv6/route.c max_size threshold that can be consumed easily, e.g., leading ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52340</link><description>The IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 6.3 has a net/ipv6/route.c max_size threshold that can be consumed easily, e.g., leading to a denial of service (network is unreachable errors) when IPv6 packets are sent in a loop via a raw socket.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 02:35:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32498 | An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder through 24.0.0, Glance before 28.0.2, and Nova before 29.0.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 19:42:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39683 | ZITADEL Vulnerable to Session Information Leakage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39683</link><description>ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. ZITADEL provides users the ability to list all user sessions of the current user agent (browser). Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 2.53.8, 2.54.5, and 2.55.1, due to a missing check, user sessions without that information (e.g. when created though the session service) were incorrectly listed exposing potentially other user's sessions. Versions 2.55.1, 2.54.5, and 2.53.8 contain a fix for the issue. There is no workaround since a patch is already available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 19:33:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36122 | Discourse doesn&amp;#x27;t limit reviewable user serializer payload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36122</link><description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.
