Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:55:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13239 | Two-factor Authentication (TFA) - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-003</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13239</link><description>Weak Authentication vulnerability in Drupal Two-factor Authentication (TFA) allows Authentication Abuse.This issue affects Two-factor Authentication (TFA): from 0.0.0 before 1.5.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:48:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13238 | Typogrify - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2024-002</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13238</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal Typogrify allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Typogrify: from 0.0.0 before 1.3.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13237 | File Entity (fieldable files) - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-001</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13237</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal File Entity (fieldable files) allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects File Entity (fieldable files): from 7.X-* before 7.X-2.38.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21598 | Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: When BGP traceoptions are configured, receipt of malformed BGP packets causes RPD to crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21598</link><description>An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved's routing protocol daemon (rpd) allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to send malformed BGP packets to a device configured with packet receive trace options enabled to crash rpd.

This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[]: Received malformed update from  (External AS )
and
  rpd[]: Malformed Attribute</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22149 | JWK Set&amp;#x27;s HTTP client only overwrites and appends JWK to local cache during refresh</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22149</link><description>JWK Set (JSON Web Key Set) is a JWK and JWK Set Go implementation.

This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – This action is not a common place for command injection vulnerabilities to occur. Thus, an attacker will likely only be able to find this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the firmware or trying it on all  fields. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the  binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a payload.

Impact: Critical – The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services.

CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). If is a full system compromise, potentially fully compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability of the devicer (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H).  A compromised charger can be used to "pivot" onto networks that should otherwise be closed, cause a low confidentiality and interity impact on subsequent systems.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. 

The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models.

Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.

Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page.

file path to , which is then
read by .so


This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit by
either obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trial
and error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)
account to gain access to the .exe CGI binary or .sh
script to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such access
send an HTTP request that triggers it.


Impact: High – The  process, which we assume is
responsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing after
performing the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflow
causes the process to segfault before
 is removed. This means that,
even though  is automatically restarted, it will crash
again as soon as it tries to parse the text file.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will need to have knowledge of this CGI binary, e.g. by finding it in firmware. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the .exe or .exe CGI binary and upload the file, or convince a user with such access to upload it.

Impact: Low – The attacker can upload arbitrary files to /tmp/upload/ or /tmp/. However, the attacker is unable to access or use these files without other vulnerabilities.

Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.

Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station. However, a skilled attacker might be able to use one of these buffer overflows to obtain remote code execution.

powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing powermac #size-cells

On some powermacs `escc` nodes are missing `#size-cells` properties,
which is deprecated and now triggers a warning at boot since commit
045b14ca5c36 ("of: WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells
handling").

For example:

  Missing '#size-cells' in /pci@f2000000/mac-io@c/escc@13000

As powermacs boot via prom_init it's possible to add the missing
properties to the device tree during boot, avoiding the warning. Note
that `escc-legacy` nodes are also missing `#size-cells` properties, but
they are skipped by the macio driver, so leave them alone.

bpf: put bpf_link's program when link is safe to be deallocated

In general, BPF link's underlying BPF program should be considered to be
reachable through attach hook -&gt; link -&gt; prog chain, and, pessimistically,
we have to assume that as long as link's memory is not safe to free,
attach hook's code might hold a pointer to BPF program and use it.

As such, it's not (generally) correct to put link's program early before
waiting for RCU GPs to go through. More eager bpf_prog_put() that we
currently do is mostly correct due to BPF program's release code doing
similar RCU GP waiting, but as will be shown in the following patches,
BPF program can be non-sleepable (and, thus, reliant on only "classic"
RCU GP), while BPF link's attach hook can have sleepable semantics and
needs to be protected by RCU Tasks Trace, and for such cases BPF link
has to go through RCU Tasks Trace + "classic" RCU GPs before being
deallocated. And so, if we put BPF program early, we might free BPF
program before we free BPF link, leading to use-after-free situation.

So, this patch defers bpf_prog_put() until we are ready to perform
bpf_link's deallocation. At worst, this delays BPF program freeing by
one extra RCU GP, but that seems completely acceptable. Alternatively,
we'd need more elaborate ways to determine BPF hook, BPF link, and BPF
program lifetimes, and how they relate to each other, which seems like
an unnecessary complication.

Note, for most BPF links we still will perform eager bpf_prog_put() and
link dealloc, so for those BPF links there are no observable changes
whatsoever. Only BPF links that use deferred dealloc might notice
slightly delayed freeing of BPF programs.

Also, to reduce code and logic duplication, extract program put + link
dealloc logic into bpf_link_dealloc() helper.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:59:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56787 | soc: imx8m: Probe the SoC driver as platform driver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56787</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: imx8m: Probe the SoC driver as platform driver

With driver_async_probe=* on kernel command line, the following trace is
produced because on i.MX8M Plus hardware because the soc-imx8m.c driver
calls of_clk_get_by_name() which returns -EPROBE_DEFER because the clock
driver is not yet probed. This was not detected during regular testing
without driver_async_probe.

Convert the SoC code to platform driver and instantiate a platform device
in its current device_initcall() to probe the platform driver. Rework
.soc_revision callback to always return valid error code and return SoC
revision via parameter. This way, if anything in the .soc_revision callback
return -EPROBE_DEFER, it gets propagated to .probe and the .probe will get
retried later.

mtd: spinand: winbond: Fix 512GW, 01GW, 01JW and 02JW ECC information

These four chips:
* W25N512GW
* W25N01GW
* W25N01JW
* W25N02JW
all require a single bit of ECC strength and thus feature an on-die
Hamming-like ECC engine. There is no point in filling a -&gt;get_status()
callback for them because the main ECC status bytes are located in
standard places, and retrieving the number of bitflips in case of
corrected chunk is both useless and unsupported (if there are bitflips,
then there is 1 at most, so no need to query the chip for that).

Without this change, a kernel warning triggers every time a bit flips.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:52:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56772 | kunit: string-stream: Fix a UAF bug in kunit_init_suite()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56772</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix handling of plane refcount

[Why]
The mechanism to backup and restore plane states doesn't maintain
refcount, which can cause issues if the refcount of the plane changes
in between backup and restore operations, such as memory leaks if the
refcount was supposed to go down, or double frees / invalid memory
accesses if the refcount was supposed to go up.

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

                   NFS CLIENT
thread1                             thread2
open("file")
...

 _nfs4_do_open
  _nfs4_open_and_get_state
   _nfs4_proc_open
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task1 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

                                    umount -f
                                    nfs_umount_begin
                                     rpc_killall_tasks
                                      rpc_signal_task
     rpc_task1 been wakeup
     and return -512
 _nfs4_do_open // while loop
    ...
    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task
     rpc_wait_for_completion_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback

One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:

freeze_super()
  sync_filesystem()
    ext4_sync_fs()
      dquot_writeback_dquots()

Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in
this path, we can end up with the following race:

 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.
 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.
 3. Freeze completes.
 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which
    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:

  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)
  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]
  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]
  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0

Which is the following line:

  WARN_ON(sb-&gt;s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);

Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg
noise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.

To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during
dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after
freeze.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:52:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35685 | In DevmemIntMapPages of devicemem_server.c, there is a possible physical page uaf due to a logic error in the code.

net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc

In general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the
number of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds.
In case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal
tfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use
'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created
or dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics
of netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.
'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.
If a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent
about this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the
newly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.
If 'qlen' reaches the configured sch-&gt;limit, the enqueue function stops
working, even though the tfifo is not full.

Reproduce the bug:
Ensure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root
qdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine
as follows:
$ tc qdisc add dev  root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100
$ tc qdisc add dev  parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms

Send bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3
client on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:
$ tc -s qdisc show dev 

Statistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that
netem's backlog &gt; limit, netem stopped accepting packets):
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0
qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

Statistics after the fix:
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0
qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms
 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

tbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.
The interface fully stops transferring packets and "locks". In this case,
the child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at
its limit and no more packets are accepted.

This patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is
only decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not
during enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus
accounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As
in other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in
netem and all of its children. As before, sch-&gt;limit remains as the
maximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's
backlog statistics.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:42:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55459 | An issue in keras 3.7.0 allows attackers to write arbitrary files to the user's machine via downloading a crafted tar file through the get_f...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55459</link><description>An issue in keras 3.7.0 allows attackers to write arbitrary files to the user's machine via downloading a crafted tar file through the get_file function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20166 | Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20166</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.
