In the ESPTouchV2 protocol, while there is an option to use a custom AES key, there is no option to set the IV (Initialization Vector) prior to versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. The IV is set to zero and remains constant throughout the product's lifetime. In AES/CBC mode, if the IV is not properly initialized, the encrypted output becomes deterministic, leading to potential data leakage. To address the aforementioned issues, the application generates a random IV when activating the AES key starting in versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. This IV is then transmitted along with the provision data to the provision device. The provision device has also been equipped with a parser for the AES IV. The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of ESPTouch v2 component from ESP-IDF. As it is implemented in the ESP Wi-Fi stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:45:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53273 | GHSL-2024-110: Reflected XSS in /register in habitica</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53273</link><description>Habitica is an open-source habit-building program.

An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:22:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47607 | GHSL-2024-116: Stack-buffer overflow in gst_opus_dec_parse_header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47607</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components.  stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the gst_opus_dec_parse_header function within `gstopusdec.c'.

Additionally, the dereference of value-&gt;value_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37377 | A heap-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a d...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37377</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37401 | An out-of-bounds read in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial o...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37401</link><description>An out-of-bounds read in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42448 | From the VSPC management agent machine, under condition that the management agent is authorized on the server, it is possible to perform Rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42448</link><description>From the VSPC management agent machine, under condition that the management agent is authorized on the server, it is possible to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the VSPC server machine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45337 | Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45337</link><description>Applications and libraries which misuse the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback callback may be susceptible to an authorization bypass.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47537 | GHSL-2024-094: GStreamer has an OOB-write in isomp4/qtdemux.c</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47537</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream-&gt;samples to accommodate stream-&gt;n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47538 | GHSL-2024-115: GStreamer has a stack-buffer overflow in vorbis_handle_identification_packet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47538</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd-&gt;vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure.

An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was identified in the convert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c. The vulnerability arises due to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the storage array and the loop condition i * 2 &lt; ccpair_size. Specifically, when ccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This bug allows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated bounds of the storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47540 | GHSL-2024-197: GStreamer uses uninitialized stack memory in Matroska/WebM demuxer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47540</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size &lt; 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap_full or mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution.

An OOB-write vulnerability has been identified in the gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes function of the gstssaparse.c file. This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}). The issue arises when a closing curly bracket "}" appears before an opening curly bracket "{" in the input string. In this case, memmove() incorrectly duplicates a substring. With each successive loop iteration, the size passed to memmove() becomes progressively larger (strlen(end+1)), leading to a write beyond the allocated memory bounds.

An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in qtdemux_parse_container function within qtdemux.c. In the parent function qtdemux_parse_node, the value of length is not well checked. So, if length is big enough, it causes the pointer end to point beyond the boundaries of buffer. Subsequently, in the qtdemux_parse_container function, the while loop can trigger an OOB-read, accessing memory beyond the bounds of buf. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory.

Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient validation of the "integration time" present in "v2" and "v3" bundles during the verification flow: the "integration time" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect "v1" bundles, as the "v1" bundle format always requires an inclusion promise.

Sigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 23:16:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54133 | Possible Content Security Policy bypass in Action Dispatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54133</link><description>Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:58:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55653 | pwndoc&amp;#x27;s UnhandledPromiseRejection on audits causes Denial of Service (DoS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55653</link><description>PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator.

evasion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53866</link><description>The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55602 | PenDoc vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read on updating and downloading templates using Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55602</link><description>PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator.

Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:48:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12236 | Use of Custom URI for media inputs with VPC-SC enabled potentially leads to data exfiltration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12236</link><description>A security issue exists in Vertex Gemini API for customers using VPC-SC.
