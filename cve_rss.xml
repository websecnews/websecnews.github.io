Due to the unquoted path configuration in the SerialInterfaceService.exe utility, a local attacker with limited privileges could place a malicious executable in a higher-priority directory within the search path. When the Serial Interface service starts, the malicious executable could be run with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation could allow privilege escalation or enable an attacker to maintain persistence on the affected system. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability within any subsequent systems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:18:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9118 | Dataform Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9118</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability in the NPM package installation process of Google Cloud Dataform allows a remote attacker to read and write files in other customers' repositories via a maliciously crafted package.json file.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:19:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54300 | Extension - norrnext.com - Stored XSS vulnerability in Quantum Manager component 1.0.0-3.2.0 for Joomla</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54300</link><description>A stored XSS vulnerability in Quantum Manager component 1.0.0-3.2.0 for Joomla was discovered.
