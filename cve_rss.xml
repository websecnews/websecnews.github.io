This device exposes a web management interface on port 80. This web management interface can be used by administrators to control product
features, setup network switching, and register license among other features. The application has been developed in PHP with the webEASY SDK, also named ‘ewb’ by Evertz.

This web interface has two endpoints that are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection and the authentication mechanism has a flaw leading to authentication bypass.

Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges ( root ) on affected devices.

This level of access could lead to serious business impact such as the interruption of media streaming, modification of media being streamed, alteration of closed captions being generated, among others.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 07:16:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4947 | QUIC certificate check skip with wolfSSL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4947</link><description>libcurl accidentally skips the certificate verification for QUIC connections when connecting to a host specified as an IP address in the URL.

Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3, when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 06:46:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4800 | MasterStudy LMS Pro &amp;lt;= 4.7.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4800</link><description>The MasterStudy LMS Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing file type validation in the stm_lms_add_assignment_attachment function in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.0.

Leading zeros are used to indicate octal numbers, which can confuse users who are intentionally using octal notation, as well as users who believe they are using decimal notation.

Net::CIDR::Set used code from Net::CIDR::Lite, which had a similar vulnerability CVE-2021-47154.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 21:33:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5198 | Stackrox: xss in stackrox</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5198</link><description>A flaw was found in Stackrox, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the script code is included in a small subset of table cells.

Prior to versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6, the VerifyCertificate() function can be tricked into incorrectly treating certificates as valid. This allows an attacker to send a malicious certificate request that is then treated as a renewal of an already existing certificate, resulting in the attacker obtaining a valid certificate that can be used to impersonate trusted nodes. This only occurs when Icinga 2 is built with OpenSSL older than version 1.1.0.

net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during -&gt;change()

Previously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the -&gt;change() operation, only
the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb
list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check
sch-&gt;limit against sch-&gt;q.qlen.

This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures
both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming
excess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)
are updated to use this helper in their -&gt;change() routines.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39498 | WordPress Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium) plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.1 - Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39498</link><description>Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data vulnerability in Spotlight Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium) allows Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data.This issue affects Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium): from n/a through 1.7.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 14:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46804 | Screen 5.0.0 and older versions allow file existence tests when installed setuid-root</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46804</link><description>A minor information leak when running Screen with setuid-root privileges allosw unprivileged users to deduce information about a path that would otherwise not be available.
