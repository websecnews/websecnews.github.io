Directus &gt;=9.23.0, &lt;=v10.5.3 improperly handles _in, _nin operators. It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {"role": {"_in": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.6.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 16:53:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39312 | Botan has an Authorization Error due to Name Constraint Decoding Bug</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39312</link><description>Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. A bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions in X.509 certificates meant that if the extension included both permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees, only the permitted subtree would be checked. If a certificate included a name which was permitted by the permitted subtree but also excluded by excluded subtree, it would be accepted. Fixed in versions 3.5.0 and 2.19.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 16:44:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34702 | Botan has a Denial of Service Due to Excessive Name Constraints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34702</link><description>Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters.  Prior to 3.5.0 and 2.19.5, checking name constraints in X.509 certificates is quadratic in the number of names and name constraints. An attacker who presented a certificate chain which contained a very large number of names in the SubjectAlternativeName, signed by a CA certificate which contained a large number of name constraints, could cause a denial of service. The problem has been addressed in Botan 3.5.0 and a partial backport has also been applied and is included in Botan 2.19.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 16:33:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23562 | HCL Domino is susceptible to an information disclosure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23562</link><description>A security vulnerability in HCL Domino could allow disclosure of sensitive configuration information.

There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:43:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41251 | A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the boa formRoute functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11.

In line 313 "addr_loaded_cnt" is checked not to be "CHECK_IMAGE_AREA_CNT" (5) or larger, this check does not halt the function. Immediately after (line 317) there will be an overflow in the buffer and the value of "dst" will be written to the area immediately after the buffer, which is "addr_loaded_cnt". This will allow an attacker to freely control the value of "addr_loaded_cnt" and thus control the destination of the write immediately after (line 318). The write in line 318 will then be fully controlled by said attacker, with whichever address and whichever value ("len") they desire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:23:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39677 | NHibernate SQL injection vulnerability in discriminator mappings, static fields referenced in HQL, and some utilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39677</link><description>NHibernate is an object-relational mapper for the .NET framework.

drm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting race


filp-&gt;pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before this
patch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct
pid after storing a pointer to it in filp-&gt;pid and dropping the
dev-&gt;filelist_mutex, making the following race possible:

process A               process B
=========               =========
                        begin drm_file_update_pid
                        mutex_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp-&gt;pid, , 1)
                        mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
begin drm_file_update_pid
mutex_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
rcu_replace_pointer(filp-&gt;pid, , 1)
mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
get_pid()
synchronize_rcu()
put_pid()   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***
                        get_pid()   *** UAF ***
                        synchronize_rcu()
                        put_pid()

As far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
because it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not
explicitly calling into the scheduler.

This race leads to use-after-free of a "struct pid".
It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass
through a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between
mutex_unlock() and get_pid().

Fix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid
is stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.

This fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I think
that optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case we
would usually have bailed out on the lockless check above.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 09:29:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5616 | CSRF Vulnerability in mudler/LocalAI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5616</link><description>A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in mudler/LocalAI versions up to and including 2.15.0, which allows attackers to trick victims into deleting installed models.
