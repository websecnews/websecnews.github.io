With access to the underlying operating system, the attacker could also establish root access on the affected device.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20263 | A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20263</link><description>A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switches and Business 350 Series Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of ACLs on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker does not have control over the conditions that result in the device being in the vulnerable state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20305 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20305</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0933 | Niushop B2B2C Upload.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0933</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Niushop B2B2C V5 and classified as critical.

to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
and PKCS12_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 09:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48622 | In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_loa...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48622</link><description>In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks in a crafted .ani file.
