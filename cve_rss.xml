When using the partition clause in SQLTableCheckOperator as parameter (which was a recommended pattern), Authenticated UI User could inject arbitrary SQL command when triggering DAG exposing partition_clause to the user.
This allowed the DAG Triggering user to escalate privileges to execute those arbitrary commands which they normally would not have.


This issue affects Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider: before 1.24.1.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.24.1, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 08:47:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3344 | codeprojects Online Restaurant Management System assign_save.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3344</link><description>A vulnerability was found in codeprojects Online Restaurant Management System 1.0.

Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions &gt;= 2.4.16.11.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:18:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32013 | Server-Side Request Forgery via LNURL Authentication Callback in LNbits Lightning Network Payment System</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32013</link><description>LNbits is a Lightning wallet and accounts system. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability has been discovered in LNbits' LNURL authentication handling functionality. When processing LNURL authentication requests, the application accepts a callback URL parameter and makes an HTTP request to that URL using the httpx library with redirect following enabled. The application doesn't properly validate the callback URL, allowing attackers to specify internal network addresses and access internal resources.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:18:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31488 | Plain Craft Launcher&amp;#x27;s custom homepage can use Internet Explorer to load web pages with the help of controls such as WebBrowser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31488</link><description>Plain Craft Launcher (PCL) is a launcher for Minecraft. PCL allows users to use homepages provided by third parties. If controls such as WebBrowser are used in the homepage, WPF will use Internet Explorer to load the specified webpage. If the user uses a malicious homepage, the attacker can use IE background to access the specified webpage without knowing it. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.9.3.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:18:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2259 | Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo component HTTP server single PUT request integer underflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2259</link><description>In NetX HTTP server functionality of Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo before 
version 6.4.3, an attacker can cause an integer underflow and a 
subsequent denial of service by writing a very large file, by specially 
crafted packets with Content-Length in one packet smaller than the data 
request size of the other packet. A possible workaround is to disable 
HTTP PUT support.

an error condition, resulting in the 404 error for each further file 
request. Users can work-around the issue by disabling the PUT request 
support.
