In versions prior to 11.0.2, a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache, it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused, resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs, the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache, and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval. This issue has been patched in version 11.0.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 01:25:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59938 | Heap buffer overflow in wazuh-analysisd</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59938</link><description>Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response.

Due to a software bug, the configuration to restrict commands was ignored when passed to ECI, allowing any command to be executed on the socket. This grants excessive privileges by permitting unrestricted access to powerful Docker commands.

The vulnerability affects only Docker Desktop 4.46.0 users that have ECI enabled and are using the Docker socket command restrictions feature. In addition, since ECI restricts mounting the Docker socket into containers by default, it only affects containers which are explicitly allowed by the administrator to mount the Docker socket.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 21:22:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11046 | Tencent WeKnora test testEmbeddingModel server-side request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11046</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in Tencent WeKnora 0.1.0.

A malicious actor with administrative privileges can upload arbitrary files to a user-controlled location on the server.


By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker can upload a specially crafted payload and achieve remote code execution (RCE), potentially compromising the server and its data.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 08:32:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1396 | Username Enumeration in Multiple WSO2 Products with Multi-Attribute Login Enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1396</link><description>A username enumeration vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled. In this configuration, the system returns a distinct "User does not exist" error message to the login form, regardless of the validate_username setting. This behavior allows malicious actors to determine which usernames exist in the system based on observable discrepancies in the application's responses.


Exploitation of this vulnerability could aid in brute-force attacks, targeted phishing campaigns, or other social engineering techniques by confirming the validity of user identifiers within the system.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 07:59:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54831 | Apache Airflow: Connection sensitive details exposed to users with READ permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54831</link><description>Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a "write-only" model for sensitive values.


In Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.


This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.






Users of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to &gt;=3.0.4.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 07:42:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-35027 | Unitree Multiple Robotic Products Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-35027</link><description>Multiple robotic products by Unitree sharing a common firmware, including the Go2, G1, H1, and B2 devices, contain a command injection vulnerability.
