However, the documentation says this API call: "Generates private and public Diffie-Hellman key values".

The documented behavior is very different from the actual behavior, and this difference could easily lead to security issues in applications that use these APIs as the DiffieHellman may be used as the basis for application-level security, implications are consequently broad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 19:24:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48121 | An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Direct Connection Module in Ezviz CS-C6N-xxx prior to v5.3.x build 20230401, Ezviz CS-CV310-xx...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48121</link><description>An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Direct Connection Module in Ezviz CS-C6N-xxx prior to v5.3.x build 20230401, Ezviz CS-CV310-xxx prior to v5.3.x build 20230401, Ezviz CS-C6CN-xxx prior to v5.3.x build 20230401, Ezviz CS-C3N-xxx prior to v5.3.x build 20230401 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sending crafted messages to the affected devices.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 18:37:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49078 | Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in raptor-web 0.4.4</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49078</link><description>raptor-web is a CMS for game server communities that can be used to host information and keep track of players.

This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request.

In details, in ActiveMQ configurations, jetty allows
org.jolokia.http.AgentServlet to handler request to /api/jolokia

org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#handlePostRequest is able to
create JmxRequest through JSONObject. And calls to
org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#executeRequest.

Into deeper calling stacks,
org.jolokia.handler.ExecHandler#doHandleRequest is able to invoke
through refection.

And then, RCE is able to be achieved via
jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl which exists on Java version above 11.

1 Call newRecording.

2 Call setConfiguration. And a webshell data hides in it.

3 Call startRecording.

4 Call copyTo method. The webshell will be written to a .jsp file.

The mitigation is to restrict (by default) the actions authorized on Jolokia, or disable Jolokia.
A more restrictive Jolokia configuration has been defined in default ActiveMQ distribution. We encourage users to upgrade to ActiveMQ distributions version including updated Jolokia configuration: 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, 6.0.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49313 | A dylib injection vulnerability in XMachOViewer 0.04 allows attackers to compromise integrity.

vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the "msiexec.exe" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.

The issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the "msiexec.exe" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.

The severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or "non-privileged") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged "msiexec.exe" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.

It is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 01:39:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35136 | An improper input validation vulnerability in the “Quagga” package of the Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.37, USG FLEX ser...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35136</link><description>An improper input validation vulnerability in the “Quagga” package of the Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.37, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.37, USG FLEX 50(W) series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37, USG20(W)-VPN series firmware versions 4.16 through 5.37, and VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.37, could allow an authenticated local attacker to access configuration files on an affected device.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 01:39:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35139 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CGI program of the Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 5.10 through 5.37, USG FLEX series f...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35139</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CGI program of the Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 5.10 through 5.37, USG FLEX series firmware versions 5.00 through 5.37, USG FLEX 50(W) series firmware versions 5.10 through 5.37, USG20(W)-VPN series firmware versions 5.10 through 5.37, and VPN series firmware versions 5.00 through 5.37, could allow an unauthenticated LAN-based attacker to store malicious scripts in a vulnerable device.
