block: fix memory leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages

Move the fatal signal check before bio_alloc() to prevent a memory
leak when BLKDEV_ZERO_KILLABLE is set and a fatal signal is pending.

Previously, the bio was allocated before checking for a fatal signal.
If a signal was pending, the code would break out of the loop without
freeing or chaining the just-allocated bio, causing a memory leak.

This matches the pattern already used in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes()
where the signal check precedes the allocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68349 | NFSv4/pNFS: Clear NFS_INO_LAYOUTCOMMIT in pnfs_mark_layout_stateid_invalid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68349</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans-&gt;len + 1)',
which includes the 1-byte command header.

When copying data from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
as the length is incorrect because:

1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' (which has size
   'trans-&gt;len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf' if 'len' is
   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1
   overflows the buffer.

Fix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68353 | net: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68353</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one

Neither sock4 nor sock6 pointers are guaranteed to be non-NULL in
vxlan_xmit_one, e.g. if the iface is brought down. This can lead to the
following NULL dereference:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010

Mentioned commits changed the code path in vxlan_xmit_one and as a side
effect the sock4/6 pointer validity checks in vxlan(6)_get_route were
lost. Fix this by adding back checks.

Since both commits being fixed were released in the same version (v6.7)

gfs2: Prevent recursive memory reclaim

Function new_inode() returns a new inode with inode-&gt;i_mapping-&gt;gfp_mask
set to GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.  This value includes the __GFP_FS flag, so
allocations in that address space can recurse into filesystem memory
reclaim.  We don't want that to happen because it can consume a
significant amount of stack memory.

Worse than that is that it can also deadlock: for example, in several
places, gfs2_unstuff_dinode() is called inside filesystem transactions.
This calls filemap_grab_folio(), which can allocate a new folio, which
can trigger memory reclaim.  If memory reclaim recurses into the
filesystem and starts another transaction, a deadlock will ensue.

To fix these kinds of problems, prevent memory reclaim from recursing
into filesystem code by making sure that the gfp_mask of inode address
spaces doesn't include __GFP_FS.

The "meta" and resource group address spaces were already using GFP_NOFS
as their gfp_mask (which doesn't include __GFP_FS).  The default value
of GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is less restrictive than GFP_NOFS, though.  To
avoid being overly limiting, use the default value and only knock off
the __GFP_FS flag.  I'm not sure if this will actually make a
difference, but it also shouldn't hurt.

This patch is loosely based on commit ad22c7a043c2 ("xfs: prevent stack
overflows from page cache allocation").

Fixes xfstest generic/273.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68357 | iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68357</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix racy bitfield write in btrfs_clear_space_info_full()

From the memory-barriers.txt document regarding memory barrier ordering
guarantees:

 (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often
     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write
     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel
     algorithms.

 (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields
     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields
     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's
     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one
     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.

btrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of
the fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush:

struct btrfs_space_info {
        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info;              /*     0     8 */
        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent;               /*     8     8 */
        ...
        int                        clamp;                /*   172     4 */
        unsigned int               full:1;               /*   176: 0  4 */
        unsigned int               chunk_alloc:1;        /*   176: 1  4 */
        unsigned int               flush:1;              /*   176: 2  4 */
        ...

Therefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to
one of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the
bitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and
writes out found-&gt;full = 0 without a lock.

Imagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we
finished deleting a block_group and are thus calling
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim
ticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space():

          T1                                             T2
btrfs_commit_transaction
  btrfs_clear_space_info_full
  data_sinfo-&gt;full = 0
  READ: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)
                                              spin_lock(&amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                              if(list_empty(tickets))
                                                space_info-&gt;flush = 0;
                                                READ: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                                MOD/WRITE: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:0
                                                spin_unlock(&amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                                return;
  MOD/WRITE: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1

and now data_sinfo-&gt;flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This
breaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or
running. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go
into __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info-&gt;tickets but will
see space_info-&gt;flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,
they will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible
to kick the worker again.

I also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that
it is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,
the assembly is:
  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)
and similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0:
  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)

So I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed
a number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to
reproduce it.

Rather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take
advantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that
it is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to
bools. This avoids writes to space_info-&gt;full having any effect on

btrfs: fix double free of qgroup record after failure to add delayed ref head

In the previous code it was possible to incur into a double kfree()
scenario when calling add_delayed_ref_head(). This could happen if the
record was reported to already exist in the
btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error
later on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since
add_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the
record. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer
to NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object
which was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.

The problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the
object is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the
fix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of
the add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()
the given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to
act on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the
'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the
tracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'
boolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object
only if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the
tracing logic.

As a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that
'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the
function, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert
happens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid
value on an early exit.

The documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated
to reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68360 | wifi: mt76: wed: use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68360</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()

The rtl8187_rx_cb() calculates the rx descriptor header address
by subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer.
However, it does not validate if the received packet
(skb-&gt;len from urb-&gt;actual_length) is large enough to contain this
header.

If a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer
underflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,
and causing a kernel panic.

Add length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers
before attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the
check fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68363 | bpf: Check skb-&amp;gt;transport_header is set in bpf_skb_check_mtu</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68363</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check skb-&gt;transport_header is set in bpf_skb_check_mtu

the BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS flag is used:

	bpf_skb_check_mtu(skb, ifindex, &amp;mtu_len, 0, BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS)

The transport_header is not always set. There is a WARN_ON_ONCE
report when CONFIG_DEBUG_NET is enabled + skb-&gt;gso_size is set +
bpf_prog_test_run is used:

For a normal ingress skb (not test_run), skb_reset_transport_header
is performed but there is plan to avoid setting it as described in
commit 2170a1f09148 ("net: no longer reset transport_header in __netif_receive_skb_core()").

This patch fixes the bpf helper by checking
skb_transport_header_was_set(). The check is done just before
skb-&gt;transport_header is used, to avoid breaking the existing bpf prog.
The WARN_ON_ONCE is limited to bpf_prog_test_run, so targeting bpf-next.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68364 | ocfs2: relax BUG() to ocfs2_error() in __ocfs2_move_extent()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68364</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal

Correct possible race conditions during device removal.

Previously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute
after the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other
resource access issues.

This race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN
reset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to
use-after-free and improper access to freed resources.

  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in
    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset
    is skipped.

  - Cancel any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().

  - Ensure device freeing in sdev_destroy() is done while holding the
    LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68372 | nbd: defer config put in recv_work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68372</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: defer config put in recv_work

There is one uaf issue in recv_work when running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK and
NBD_CMD_RECONFIGURE:
  nbd_genl_connect     // conf_ref=2 (connect and recv_work A)
  nbd_open	       // conf_ref=3

  recv_work B
    config_put         // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&amp;config-&gt;recv_threads); -&gt; UAF

Or only running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK:

  nbd_open 	     // conf_ref=3
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK     // conf_ref=2

  recv_work
    config_put 	     // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&amp;config-&gt;recv_threads); -&gt; UAF

Commit 87aac3a80af5 ("nbd: call nbd_config_put() before notifying the
waiter") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in
recv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not
be woken up while nbd-&gt;task_recv was still uncleared.

However, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly
calls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.
Therefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.

Move nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is
held for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the
config cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear
+ reconfigure interleave.

In addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last
nbd_put (which causes deadlock):

path A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_disconnect_and_put
        flush_workqueue // recv_work done
      nbd_config_put
        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0
        queue_work

path B (netlink without NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=2 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=3

perf/x86: Fix NULL event access and potential PEBS record loss

When intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() is called to drain PEBS records, the
perf_event_overflow() could be called to process the last PEBS record.

While perf_event_overflow() could trigger the interrupt throttle and
stop all events of the group, like what the below call-chain shows.

perf_event_overflow()
  -&gt; __perf_event_overflow()
    -&gt;__perf_event_account_interrupt()
      -&gt; perf_event_throttle_group()
        -&gt; perf_event_throttle()
          -&gt; event-&gt;pmu-&gt;stop()
            -&gt; x86_pmu_stop()

The side effect of stopping the events is that all corresponding event
pointers in cpuc-&gt;events[] array are cleared to NULL.

Assume there are two PEBS events (event a and event b) in a group. When
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() calls perf_event_overflow() to process the
last PEBS record of PEBS event a, interrupt throttle is triggered and
all pointers of event a and event b are cleared to NULL. Then
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() tries to process the last PEBS record of
event b and encounters NULL pointer access.

To avoid this issue, move cpuc-&gt;events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop()
to x86_pmu_del(). It's safe since cpuc-&gt;active_mask or
cpuc-&gt;pebs_enabled is always checked before access the event pointer
from cpuc-&gt;events[].</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68376 | coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68376</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue

When ETR is enabled as CS_MODE_SYSFS, if the buffer size is changed
and enabled again, currently sysfs_buf will point to the newly
allocated memory(buf_new) and free the old memory(buf_old). But the
etr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed to buf_old, not
updated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory
use-after-free issue.

Fix this by checking ETR's mode before updating and releasing buf_old,
if the mode is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68377 | ns: initialize ns_list_node for initial namespaces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68377</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment

In ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is sent to
firmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,
which goes against firmwire's definition.

While connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not
supported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff
is assigned to he_mcs-&gt;rx_mcs_set field.

	Ext Tag: HE Capabilities
	    [...]
	    Supported HE-MCS and NSS Set
		[...]
	        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz
		    [...]
	            Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff

Swap the assignment to fix this issue.

As the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it
needs to go via he_mcs-&gt;rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping
done, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.

bpf: Do not let BPF test infra emit invalid GSO types to stack

Yinhao et al. reported that their fuzzer tool was able to trigger a
skb_warn_bad_offload() from netif_skb_features() -&gt; gso_features_check().
When a BPF program - triggered via BPF test infra - pushes the packet
to the loopback device via bpf_clone_redirect() then mentioned offload
warning can be seen. GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.

We get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting
gso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense
that this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due
to the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy
through setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific
assumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further
into the GSO engine in the first place.

The checks were added in 121d57af308d ("gso: validate gso_type in GSO
handlers") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine
a protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such
packets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via
netif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs
could be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be
an additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given
bpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit
such packets, lets reject them right there.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:44:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68726 | crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68726</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling

Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg")
introduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type
specific reqsize fields. It looks like this was introduced specifically
for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent commits
add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.

However, this is being recommended for use in all crypto algs
instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
cra_reqsize in aead algorithms, hence, causes memory corruptions and
crashes as the underlying functions in the algorithm framework have not
been updated to set the reqsize properly from cra_reqsize. [1]

Add proper set_reqsize calls in the aead init function to properly
initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.

wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path

Currently, packets received on the REO exception ring from
unassociated peers are of MSDU buffer type, while the driver expects
link descriptor type packets. These packets are not parsed further due
to a return check on packet type in ath12k_hal_desc_reo_parse_err(),
but the associated skb is not freed. This may lead to kernel
crashes and buffer leaks.

Hence to fix, update the RX error handler to explicitly drop
MSDU buffer type packets received on the REO exception ring.
This prevents further processing of invalid packets and ensures
stability in the RX error handling path.

From versions 2.5.0 to before 2.5.2, a race condition during unloading of a DLS file can trigger a heap-based use-after-free. A concurrently running thread may be pending to unload a DLS file, leading to use of freed memory, if the synthesizer is being concurrently destroyed, or samples of the (unloaded) DLS file are concurrently used to synthesize audio. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.2. The problem will not occur, when explicitly unloading a DLS file (before synth destruction), provided that at the time of unloading, no samples of the respective file are used by active voices. The problem will not occur in versions of FluidSynth that have been compiled without native DLS support.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:57:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68664 | LangChain serialization injection vulnerability enables secret extraction in dumps/loads APIs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68664</link><description>LangChain is a framework for building agents and LLM-powered applications.

atm/fore200e: Fix possible data race in fore200e_open()

Protect access to fore200e-&gt;available_cell_rate with rate_mtx lock in the
error handling path of fore200e_open() to prevent a data race.

The field fore200e-&gt;available_cell_rate is a shared resource used to track
available bandwidth. It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(),
fore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().

In fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting
vcc-&gt;qos.txtp.max_pcr from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth.
However, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin() fails, the
function restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to
available_cell_rate without holding the lock.

This introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is a global
device resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in
fore200e_open() executes concurrently with operations like
fore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs, a
read-modify-write race occurs.

Specifically, the error path reads the rate without the lock. If another
CPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in
fore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error
path will overwrite the concurrent update with a stale value. This results
in incorrect bandwidth accounting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68340 | team: Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68340</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

team: Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add

Attempting to add a port device that is already up will expectedly fail,
but not before modifying the team device header_ops.

In the case of the syzbot reproducer the gre0 device is
already in state UP when it attempts to add it as a
port device of team0, this fails but before that
header_ops-&gt;create of team0 is changed from eth_header to ipgre_header
in the call to team_dev_type_check_change.

Later when we end up in ipgre_header() struct ip_tunnel* points to nonsense
as the private data of the device still holds a struct team.

Example sequence of iproute2 commands to reproduce the hang/BUG():
ip link add dev team0 type team
ip link add dev gre0 type gre
ip link set dev gre0 up
ip link set dev gre0 master team0
ip link set dev team0 up
ping -I team0 1.1.1.1

Move team_dev_type_check_change down where all other checks have passed
as it changes the dev type with no way to restore it in case
one of the checks that follow it fail.

Also make sure to preserve the origial mtu assignment:
  - If port_dev is not the same type as dev, dev takes mtu from port_dev
  - If port_dev is the same type as dev, port_dev takes mtu from dev

This is done by adding a conditional before the call to dev_set_mtu
to prevent it from assigning port_dev-&gt;mtu = dev-&gt;mtu and instead
letting team_dev_type_check_change assign dev-&gt;mtu = port_dev-&gt;mtu.
The conditional is needed because the patch moves the call to
team_dev_type_check_change past dev_set_mtu.

Testing:
  - team device driver in-tree selftests
  - Add/remove various devices as slaves of team device
  - syzbot</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68341 | veth: reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68341</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

veth: reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race

As explain in commit fa349e396e48 ("veth: Fix race with AF_XDP exposing
old or uninitialized descriptors") for veth there is a chance after
napi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI
instance running veth_pool(). For NAPI this is correctly handled as the
napi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting
scheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run
concurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.

The problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't
designed to be nested.

Prior to commit 401cb7dae813 ("net: Reference bpf_redirect_info via
task_struct on PREEMPT_RT.") the temporary BPF net context
bpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since
this commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When
running veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage
area. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls
one exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net
context.

Race is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()
section before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function
xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct().</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68342 | can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68342</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data

The URB received in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct
gs_host_frame. The length of the data after the header depends on the
gs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time
stamping).

Introduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have
at least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only
copy the data to that skb that has actually been received.

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header

The driver expects to receive a struct gs_host_frame in
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().

Use struct_group to describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and
check that we have at least received the header before accessing any
members of it.

To resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer chain
"dev-&gt;parent-&gt;hf_size_rx" but use "parent-&gt;hf_size_rx" instead. Since
"urb-&gt;context" contains "parent", it is always defined, while "dev" is not
defined if the URB it too short.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66845 | A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in TechStore version 1.0.

Prior to versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3, an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp Vault authentication. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient path validation when loading the Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount. An attacker with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can exfiltrate the content of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod resides) by directing the file's content to a server under their control, as part of the Vault authentication request. The potential impact includes the exfiltration of sensitive system information, such as secrets, keys, or the content of files like /etc/passwd. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:48:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34457 | wb2osz/direwolf &amp;lt;= 1.8 Stack-based Buffer Overflow DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34457</link><description>wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 694c954, contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kiss_rec_byte() located in src/kiss_frame.c.

This vulnerability may allow remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger a denial-of-service condition.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:38:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34458 | wb2osz/direwolf &amp;lt;= 1.8 Reachable Assertion DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34458</link><description>wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 3658a87, contain a reachable assertion vulnerability in the APRS MIC-E decoder function aprs_mic_e() located in src/decode_aprs.c. When processing a specially crafted AX.25 frame containing a MIC-E message with an empty or truncated comment field, the application triggers an unhandled assertion checking for a non-empty comment. This assertion failure causes immediate process termination, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by sending malformed APRS traffic.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:38:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68475 | Fedify has ReDoS Vulnerability in HTML Parsing Regex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68475</link><description>Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub. Prior to versions 1.6.13, 1.7.14, 1.8.15, and 1.9.2, a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in Fedify's document loader. The HTML parsing regex at packages/fedify/src/runtime/docloader.ts:259 contains nested quantifiers that cause catastrophic backtracking when processing maliciously crafted HTML responses.

The issue occurs because usbhs_sys_function_pullup(), which accesses the IP
registers, is executed after the USBHS clocks have been disabled. The
problem is reproducible on the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC starting with the
addition of module stop in the clock enable/disable APIs. With module stop
functionality enabled, a bus error is expected if a master accesses a
module whose clock has been stopped and module stop activated.

Disable the IP clocks at the end of remove.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68328 | firmware: stratix10-svc: fix bug in saving controller data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68328</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel
calls vm_ops-&gt;close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this
results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent
VMA splits entirely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68330 | iio: accel: bmc150: Fix irq assumption regression</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68330</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This bug seems to have been in the driver since the beginning,
but it only manifests recently, I do not know why.

Store the IRQ number in the state struct, as this is a common
pattern in other drivers, then use this to determine if we have
IRQ support or not.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68331 | usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68331</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg-&gt;dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo-&gt;cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo-&gt;resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68332 | comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68332</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev-&gt;read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
&amp;amp;struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
&amp;amp;s-&gt;async-&gt;cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own -&gt;cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10021 | A Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability exists in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK static versions (mt) before 2026.12.
