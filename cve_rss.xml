Apache Spark versions before 4.0.0, 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption cipher for RPC communication between nodes.

When spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default), but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured, Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding), which provides encryption without authentication.

This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext, potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.


To mitigate this issue, users should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable authenticated encryption or

enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to true, which provides stronger transport security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 07:34:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11160 | WPBakery Page Builder &amp;lt;= 8.6.1 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Custom JS Module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11160</link><description>The WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom JS module in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.1.

Because the challenge response can be computed from the challenge itself, a remote attacker can authenticate without knowledge of a secret and obtain a root shell on the device. This can lead to persistent remote code execution, full device compromise, and arbitrary control of the device and any managed services. The firmware used within these devices was updated in December 2016 to make this vulnerability more complex to exploit. However, it is unknown if DBLTek has taken steps to fully mitigate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 01:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2017-20205 | Valve Source SDK Stack-Based Buffer Overflow RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-20205</link><description>Valve's Source SDK (source-sdk-2013)'s ragdoll model parsing logic contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.The tokenizer function `nexttoken` copies characters from an input string into a fixed-size stack buffer without performing bounds checks. When `ParseKeyValue` processes a collisionpair rule longer than the destination buffer (256 bytes), an overflow of the stack buffer `szToken` can occur and overwrite the function return address. A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerable code by supplying a specially crafted ragdoll model which causes the oversized collisionpair rule to be parsed, resulting in remote code execution on affected clients or servers. Valve has addressed this issue in many of their Source games, but independently-developed games must manually apply patch.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 01:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2018-25117 | VestaCP Debian Installer Malicious Backdoor Supply Chain Compromise</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-25117</link><description>VestaCP commit a3f0fa1 (2018-05-31) up to commit ee03eff (2018-06-13) contain embedded malicious code that resulted in a supply-chain compromise.

In versions up to and including commit 781d91157cfc234a434d0bab45cbcf97894c642e, the /workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization. The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source URL that grants full access to the target user's Windows VM. This impacts all users with active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive. This issue has been patched in commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef.

In versions prior to 16.0.68.39 for FreePBX 16 and versions prior to 17.0.18.38 for FreePBX 17, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability is present on the Asterisk HTTP Status page. The Asterisk HTTP status page is exposed by FreePBX and is available by default on version 16 via any bound IP address at port 8088. By default on version 17, the binding is only to localhost IP, making it significantly less vulnerable. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to obtain cookies from logged-in users, allowing them to hijack a session of an administrative user. The theft of admin session cookies allows attackers to gain control over the FreePBX admin interface, enabling them to access sensitive data, modify system configurations, create backdoor accounts, and cause service disruption. This issue has been patched in version 16.0.68.39 for FreePBX 16 and version 17.0.18.38 for FreePBX 17.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 19:39:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-33177 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux and IGX OS contain a vulnerability in NvMap, where improper tracking of memory allocations could allow a local attacker ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-33177</link><description>NVIDIA Jetson Linux and IGX OS contain a vulnerability in NvMap, where improper tracking of memory allocations could allow a local attacker to cause memory overallocation.

In versions 2025.1.0 through 2025.10.1, the energy dashboard is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. An authenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript code into an energy entity's name field, which is then executed when any user hovers over data points in the energy dashboard graph tooltips. The vulnerability exists because entity names containing HTML are not properly sanitized before being rendered in graph tooltips. This could allow an attacker with authentication to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions. Additionally, if an energy provider (such as Tibber) supplies a malicious default name for an entity, the vulnerability can be exploited without direct user action when the default name is used.

Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. During artifact extraction the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name)) without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious archive entry can supply a traversal or absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction path and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary file creation or overwrite in system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence within the affected container. Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0033 | Improper access control within AMD SEV-SNP could allow an admin privileged attacker to write to the RMP during SNP initialization, potential...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0033</link><description>Improper access control within AMD SEV-SNP could allow an admin privileged attacker to write to the RMP during SNP initialization, potentially resulting in a loss of SEV-SNP guest memory integrity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56747 | Creativeitem Academy LMS up to and including 5.13 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Api_instructor controller where regul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56747</link><description>Creativeitem Academy LMS up to and including 5.13 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Api_instructor controller where regular authenticated users can access instructor-only functions without proper role validation, allowing unauthorized course creation and management.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44088 | Apache Geode: Reflected XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44088</link><description>Malicious script injection ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Apache Geode web-api (REST).

In versions before 9.1.9, a vulnerability allows arbitrary user creation, including administrative accounts, through a combination of stored SVG injection and lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with Knowledge Base edit permissions can embed a malicious SVG element containing a link in the body field of an article. When an authenticated user clicks the malicious link, they are redirected to an attacker-controlled HTML page that executes a CSRF request against the api/v1/User endpoint. If the victim is prompted for and enters their credentials, an attacker-controlled account is created with privileges determined by the CSRF payload. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.9.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10985 | OS command injection in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacke...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10985</link><description>OS command injection in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:38:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10986 | Path traversal in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10986</link><description>Path traversal in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to write data in unintended locations on disk.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:38:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5946 | RCE via the poller reload feature available only to user with high privilege</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5946</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in Centreon Infra Monitoring (Poller reload setup in the configuration modules) allows OS Command Injection.

In versions through 3.13, a Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in the character picture upload feature. An attacker can upload a text file containing a symbolic link to an arbitrary file path. When the application processes the upload, it follows the symbolic link and serves the contents of the targeted file through the web interface. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing system configurations, credentials, and other confidential information. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.
