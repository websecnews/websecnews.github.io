In versions 1.13.2 through 1.13.5, potentially untrusted data flows into PR creation logic. A malicious actor could construct a branch name that injects arbitrary code. This is patched in 1.13.6.

The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:53:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32390 | EspoCRM vulnerable to HTML Injection into phishing, which may lead to account takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32390</link><description>EspoCRM is a free, open-source customer relationship management platform. Prior to version 9.0.8, HTML Injection in Knowledge Base (KB) articles leads to complete page defacement imitating the login page. Authenticated users with the read knowledge article privilege can browse to the KB article and if they submit their credentials, they get captured in plain text. The vulnerability is allowed by overly permissive HTML editing being allowed on the KB articles. Any authenticated user with the privilege to read KB articles is impacted. In an enterprise with multiple applications, the malicious KB article could be edited to match the login pages of other applications, which would make it useful for credential harvesting against other applications as well. Version 9.0.8 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:43:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46729 | phpDVDProfiler Cross-site Scripting vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46729</link><description>julmud/phpDVDProfiler is an adoption of the defunct phpDVDProfiler project, which allows users to display on the web their DVD collections maintained with Invelos's DVDProfiler software.
