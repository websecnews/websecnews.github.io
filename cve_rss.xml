Solr instances that (1) use the "FileSystemConfigSetService" component (the default in "standalone" or "user-managed" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual "trusted" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as "trusted" and can use "" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from "FileSystemConfigSetService").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of "" tags by default.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 09:20:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52012 | Apache Solr: Configset upload on Windows allows arbitrary path write-access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52012</link><description>Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr.

Solr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the "configset upload" API.  Commonly known as a "zipslip", maliciously constructed ZIP files can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem.  
This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue.  Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solr's "Rule-Based Authentication Plugin" to restrict access to the configset upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 09:00:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12280 | WP Customer Area &amp;lt;= 8.2.4 -

Project-level access control configuration was introdu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46881</link><description>Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 06:32:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24858 | Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashe...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24858</link><description>Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 06:10:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49043 | xmlXIncludeAddNode in xinclude.c in libxml2 before 2.11.0 has a use-after-free.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49043</link><description>xmlXIncludeAddNode in xinclude.c in libxml2 before 2.11.0 has a use-after-free.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 05:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10574 | Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency &amp;lt;= (Multiple Versions) - Missing Authorization to Google Sheets Integration Credentials Modification and Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10574</link><description>The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ays_save_google_credentials' function in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency).

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

Source code may be stolen during dev when using version 3.0.0 through 3.15.12 of the webpack builder or version 3.12.2 through 3.152 of the rspack builder and a victim opens a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `window.webpackChunknuxt_app`, the attacker can get the source code. Version 3.15.13 of Nuxt patches this issue.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:57:44 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
