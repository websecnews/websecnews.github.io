When a user moves a Zulip message, they have the option to move all messages in the topic, move only subsequent messages as well, or move just a single message.  If the user chose to just move one message, and was moving it from a public stream to a private stream, Zulip would successfully move the message, -- but active users who did not have access to the private stream, but whose client had already received the message, would continue to see the message in the public stream until they reloaded their client.  Additionally, Zulip did not remove view permissions on the message from recently-active users, allowing the message to show up in the "All messages" view or in search results, but not in "Inbox" or "Recent conversations" views. While the bug has been present since moving messages between streams was first introduced in version 3.0, this option became much more common starting in Zulip 8.0, when the default option in the picker for moving the very last message in a conversation was changed. This issue is fixed in Zulip Server 8.3. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 19:43:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2714 | Campcodes Complete Online DJ Booking System booking-bwdates-reports-details.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2714</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Campcodes Complete Online DJ Booking System 1.0 and classified as critical.

An arbitrary file renaming vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API to rename arbitrary files and directories with a name that does not end in `.zip`. Store file uploads rename zip files to have a `.zip` extension if it doesn't already have one before unzipping the file.  This is fine for file and url upload methods where the files will be in a specific subdirectory of the data directory but, when using the external upload method, this allows arbitrary files and directories to be renamed. Renaming GeoServer files will most likely result in a denial of service, either completely preventing GeoServer from running or effectively deleting specific resources (such as a workspace, layer or style).  In some cases, renaming GeoServer files could revert to the default settings for that file which could be relatively harmless like removing contact information or have more serious consequences like allowing users to make OGC requests that the customized settings would have prevented them from making. The impact of renaming non-GeoServer files depends on the specific environment although some sort of denial of service is a likely outcome. Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 contain a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 15:29:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23640 | GeoServer Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Style Publisher</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23640</link><description>GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify coverage stores through the REST Coverage Store API to upload arbitrary file contents to arbitrary file locations which can lead to remote code execution. Coverage stores that are configured using relative paths use a GeoServer Resource implementation that has validation to prevent path traversal but coverage stores that are configured using absolute paths use a different Resource implementation that does not prevent path traversal.

A path traversal vulnerability in versions 2.23.4 and prior requires GeoServer Administrator with access to the admin console to misconfigure the Global Settings for log file location to an arbitrary location. The admin console GeoServer Logs page provides a preview of these contents. As this issue requires GeoServer administrators access, often representing a trusted party, the vulnerability has not received a patch as of time of publication. As a workaround, a system administrator responsible for running GeoServer can use the `GEOSERVER_LOG_FILE` setting to override any configuration option provided by the Global Settings page. The `GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION` parameter can be set as system property, environment variables, or servlet context parameters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 14:33:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28395 | SQL injection vulnerability in Best-Kit bestkit_popup v.1.7.2 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the bestkit_pop...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28395</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Best-Kit bestkit_popup v.1.7.2 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the bestkit_popup.php component.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 14:14:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28392 | SQL injection vulnerability in pscartabandonmentpro v.2.0.11 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the pscartabando...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28392</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in pscartabandonmentpro v.2.0.11 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the pscartabandonmentproFrontCAPUnsubscribeJobModuleFrontController::setEmailVisualized() method.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 14:14:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28396 | An issue in MyPrestaModules ordersexport v.6.0.2 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the download.php componen...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28396</link><description>An issue in MyPrestaModules ordersexport v.6.0.2 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the download.php component.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 14:00:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35888 | IBM Security Verify Governance information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35888</link><description>IBM Security Verify Governance 10.0.2 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security.

Technology (CET).  A sub-feature of this are Shadow Stacks (CET-SS).
CET-SS is a hardware feature designed to protect against Return Oriented
Programming attacks. When enabled, traditional stacks holding both data
and return addresses are accompanied by so called "shadow stacks",
holding little more than return addresses.  Shadow stacks aren't
writable by normal instructions, and upon function returns their
contents are used to check for possible manipulation of a return address
coming from the traditional stack.

In particular certain memory accesses need intercepting by Xen.  In
various cases the necessary emulation involves kind of replaying of
the instruction.  Such replaying typically involves filling and then
invoking of a stub.  Such a replayed instruction may raise an
exceptions, which is expected and dealt with accordingly.

Unfortunately the interaction of both of the above wasn't right:
Recovery involves removal of a call frame from the (traditional) stack.
The counterpart of this operation for the shadow stack was missing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 10:48:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46839 | pci: phantom functions assigned to incorrect contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46839</link><description>PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions,
that when enabled allows the device to generate requests using the IDs
of functions that are otherwise unpopulated.  This allows a device to
extend the number of outstanding requests.

Such phantom functions need an IOMMU context setup, but failure to
setup the context is not fatal when the device is assigned.  Not
failing device assignment when such failure happens can lead to the
primary device being assigned to a guest, while some of the phantom
functions are assigned to a different domain.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 10:41:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2690 | SourceCodester Online Discussion Forum Site uupdate.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2690</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Discussion Forum Site 1.0.

A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28250 | Cilium has possible unencrypted traffic between nodes when using WireGuard and L7 policies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28250</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7.

Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13, 2.9.9, or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:48:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21661 | Argo CD Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability Due to Unsafe Array Modification in Multi-threaded Environment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21661</link><description>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code, where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously, the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication, widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20760 | AMS XSS -  /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/js/collection/selectall/selectall.js</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20760</link><description>Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.19 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by an attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields.

PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev-&gt;cdev is held open. The call
to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
trailing put_device(), just before return.

At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev-&gt;mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev-&gt;pdev reference was not a counted
one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
would pass a stale &amp;stdev-&gt;pdev-&gt;dev pointer.

Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev-&gt;pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
future accidents.

block/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow

Since "dev_search_path" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX,
there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string
into "full_path" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were
reporting this warning:

pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number

When the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers,
the zone size will become an odd number.
The address of the zone will become:
    addr of zone0 = BASE
    addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size
    addr of zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2
    ...
The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignment va.
Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va.

So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is even
to avoid this bug.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26639 | mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26639</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section

Alexander Potapenko writes in [1]: "For every memory access in the code
instrumented by KMSAN we call kmsan_get_metadata() to obtain the metadata
for the memory being accessed.  For virtual memory the metadata pointers
are stored in the corresponding `struct page`, therefore we need to call
virt_to_page() to get them.

According to the comment in arch/x86/include/asm/page.h,
virt_to_page(kaddr) returns a valid pointer iff virt_addr_valid(kaddr) is
true, so KMSAN needs to call virt_addr_valid() as well.

To avoid recursion, kmsan_get_metadata() must not call instrumented code,
therefore ./arch/x86/include/asm/kmsan.h forks parts of
arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c to check whether a virtual address is valid or not.

But the introduction of rcu_read_lock() to pfn_valid() added instrumented
RCU API calls to virt_to_page_or_null(), which is called by
kmsan_get_metadata(), so there is an infinite recursion now.  I do not
think it is correct to stop that recursion by doing
kmsan_enter_runtime()/kmsan_exit_runtime() in kmsan_get_metadata(): that
would prevent instrumented functions called from within the runtime from
tracking the shadow values, which might introduce false positives."

Fix the issue by switching pfn_valid() to the _sched() variant of
rcu_read_lock/unlock(), which does not require calling into RCU.  Given
the critical section in pfn_valid() is very small, this is a reasonable
trade-off (with preemptible RCU).

KMSAN further needs to be careful to suppress calls into the scheduler,
which would be another source of recursion.  This can be done by wrapping
the call to pfn_valid() into preempt_disable/enable_no_resched().  The
downside is that this sacrifices breaking scheduling guarantees; however,
a kernel compiled with KMSAN has already given up any performance
guarantees due to being heavily instrumented.

Note, KMSAN code already disables tracing via Makefile, and since mmzone.h
is included, it is not necessary to use the notrace variant, which is
generally preferred in all other cases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26640 | tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26640</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy

TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map pages initially allocated
from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs.

This patch adds to can_map_frag() these additional checks:

- Page must not be a compound one.
- page-&gt;mapping must be NULL.

This fixes the panic reported by ZhangPeng.

syzbot was able to loopback packets built with sendfile(),
mapping pages owned by an ext4 file to TCP rx zerocopy.

binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()

Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.

  Task A            | Task B
  ------------------+------------------
  mmget_not_zero()  |
                    |  do_exit()
                    |    exit_mm()
                    |      mmput()
  mmput()           |
    exit_mmap()     |
      remove_vma()  |
        fput()      |

In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
from Task B that never comes (it's dead).

This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
death notifications will also be delayed until then.

In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
the corresponding mm-&gt;async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52610 | net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52610</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags

act_ct adds skb-&gt;users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order,
the last frag's reference is reset in:

  inet_frag_reasm_prepare
    skb_morph

which is not straightforward.

However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and
all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet
capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the
same time.

Fix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct
returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.

wifi: rtw88: sdio: Honor the host max_req_size in the RX path

Lukas reports skb_over_panic errors on his Banana Pi BPI-CM4 which comes
with an Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC and a RTL8822CS SDIO wifi/Bluetooth
combo card. The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed
in commit e967229ead0e ("wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST
bit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.

Lukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the
problem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following
discussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on
this problem:
- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller
  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through
  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes
- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is
  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form
- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming
  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO
  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH
  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will
  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation
  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)

Use multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the
number of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one
MMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than
the hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in
one MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error
is gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes
from the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that
or because multiple packets have been aggregated).

In case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we
need to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the

Add condition checking if we are exceeding PAGE_SIZE and exit early from

There is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggers
when the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from
/dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive read
which then dead-locks.

Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52616 | crypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52616</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

to mld_ifc_stop_work() (and mld_gq_stop_work() for good measure) with
mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() accordingly as these functions
should only be called with mc_lock per their declarations.

net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames

Mark reports a BUG() when a net namespace is removed.

    kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520!

Physical interfaces moved outside of init_net get "refunded"
to init_net when that namespace disappears. The main interface
name may get overwritten in the process if it would have
conflicted. We need to also discard all conflicting altnames.
Recent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames get moved
with the main interface, which surfaced this problem.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26635 | llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26635</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2.

syzbot reported an uninit-value bug below. [0]

llc supports ETH_P_802_2 (0x0004) and used to support ETH_P_TR_802_2
(0x0011), and syzbot abused the latter to trigger the bug.

  write$tun(r0, &amp;(0x7f0000000040)={@val={0x0, 0x11}, @val, @mpls={[], @llc={@snap={0xaa, 0x1, ')', "90e5dd"}}}}, 0x16)

llc_conn_handler() initialises local variables {saddr,daddr}.mac
based on skb in llc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes
them to __llc_lookup().

However, the initialisation is done only when skb-&gt;protocol is
htons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise, __llc_lookup_established() and
__llc_lookup_listener() will read garbage.

The missing initialisation existed prior to commit 211ed865108e
("net: delete all instances of special processing for token ring").

It removed the part to kick out the token ring stuff but forgot to
close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneak into llc_rcv().

Let's remove llc_tr_packet_type and complete the deprecation.

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes

syzbot was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1]

Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb().
Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all the sanity checks
that were performed.

This fix:

- Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space.
- Check all conditions again after socket lock is held again.
- Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.
