The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`""`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 16:26:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6253 | itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System purchase.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6253</link><description>A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System 1.0 and classified as critical.

A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an untrusted note opened in safe mode to execute arbitrary code. `packages/renderer/MarkupToHtml.ts` renders note content in safe mode by surrounding it with &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;, without escaping any interior HTML tags. Thus, an attacker can create a note that closes the opening &lt;pre&gt; tag, then includes HTML that runs JavaScript. Because the rendered markdown iframe has the same origin as the toplevel document and is not sandboxed, any scripts running in the preview iframe can access the top variable and, thus, access the toplevel NodeJS `require` function. `require` can then be used to import modules like fs or child_process and run arbitrary commands. This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.9 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 19:57:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38506 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when pasting HTML into the rich text editor in Joplin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38506</link><description>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows pasting untrusted data into the rich text editor to execute arbitrary code. HTML pasted into the rich text editor is not sanitized (or not sanitized properly). As such, the `onload` attribute of pasted images can execute arbitrary code. Because the TinyMCE editor frame does not use the `sandbox` attribute, such scripts can access NodeJS's `require` through the `top` variable. From this, an attacker can run arbitrary commands. This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.10 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 19:47:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-39517 | Cross site scripting (XSS) when clicking on an untrusted `&amp;lt;map&amp;gt;` link in Joplin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39517</link><description>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on an untrusted image link to execute arbitrary shell commands. The HTML sanitizer (`packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts::sanitizeHtml`) preserves `&lt;map&gt;` `&lt;area /&gt;` links. However, unlike `&lt;a&gt;` links, the `target` and `href` attributes are not removed. Additionally, because the note preview pane isn't sandboxed to prevent top navigation, links with `target` set to `_top` can replace the toplevel electron page. Because any toplevel electron page, with Joplin's setup, has access to `require` and can require node libraries, a malicious replacement toplevel page can import `child_process` and execute arbitrary shell commands. This issue has been fixed in commit 7c52c3e9a81a52ef1b42a951f9deb9d378d59b0f which is included in release version 2.12.8. Users are advised to upgrade.

A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted note to execute arbitrary shell commands. Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code execution because Joplin desktop: 1. has not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes, and 2. and has node integration enabled. This is a remote code execution vulnerability that impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled. This issue has been addressed in version 2.13.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 19:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6241 | Pear Admin Boot getDictItems sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6241</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Pear Admin Boot up to 2.0.2 and classified as critical.

genirq/cpuhotplug, x86/vector: Prevent vector leak during CPU offline

The absence of IRQD_MOVE_PCNTXT prevents immediate effectiveness of
interrupt affinity reconfiguration via procfs. Instead, the change is
deferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on the
original CPU.

When the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity is
enforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,
but the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediately
reclaimed. Instead, apicd-&gt;move_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaiming
process is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.

Upon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,
irq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if it
remains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over its
vector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.

However, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before the
interrupt triggers again on the new CPU.

In that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPU
to reclaim the old apicd-&gt;prev_vector because the interrupt isn't currently
affine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Even
though __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, it
doesn't reclaim apicd-&gt;prev_vector; instead, it simply resets both
apicd-&gt;move_in_progress and apicd-&gt;prev_vector to 0.

As a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to a
CPU vector leak.

To address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()
before the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd-&gt;prev_vector, if the
interrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.

Additionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,
following a warning message, although theoretically it should never see
apicd-&gt;move_in_progress with apicd-&gt;prev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33619 | efi: libstub: only free priv.runtime_map when allocated</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33619</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too

It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the
blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a
cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of
entry intervals.

We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must
be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule
entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle
time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
we move the existing "cycle == 0" check outside the "if "(!new-&gt;cycle_time)"
branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.

Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36270 | netfilter: tproxy: bail out if IP has been disabled on the device</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36270</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix missing memory barrier in tls_init

In tls_init(), a write memory barrier is missing, and store-store
reordering may cause NULL dereference in tls_{setsockopt,getsockopt}.

CPU0                               CPU1
-----                              -----
// In tls_init()
// In tls_ctx_create()
ctx = kzalloc()
ctx-&gt;sk_proto = READ_ONCE(sk-&gt;sk_prot) -(1)

// In update_sk_prot()
WRITE_ONCE(sk-&gt;sk_prot, tls_prots)     -(2)

                                   // In sock_common_setsockopt()

In the above scenario, when (1) and (2) are reordered, (3) can observe
the NULL value of ctx-&gt;sk_proto, causing NULL dereference.

To fix it, we rely on rcu_assign_pointer() which implies the release
barrier semantic. By moving rcu_assign_pointer() after ctx-&gt;sk_proto is
initialized, we can ensure that ctx-&gt;sk_proto are visible when
changing sk-&gt;sk_prot.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37353 | virtio: delete vq in vp_find_vqs_msix() when request_irq() fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37353</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dctcp_update_alpha().

In dctcp_update_alpha(), we use a module parameter dctcp_shift_g
as follows:

  alpha -= min_not_zero(alpha, alpha &gt;&gt; dctcp_shift_g);
  ...
  delivered_ce &lt;&lt;= (10 - dctcp_shift_g);

It seems syzkaller started fuzzing module parameters and triggered
shift-out-of-bounds [0] by setting 100 to dctcp_shift_g:

  memcpy((void*)0x20000080,
         "/sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g\000", 47);
  res = syscall(__NR_openat, /*fd=*/0xffffffffffffff9cul, /*file=*/0x20000080ul,
                /*flags=*/2ul, /*mode=*/0ul);
  memcpy((void*)0x20000000, "100\000", 4);
  syscall(__NR_write, /*fd=*/r[0], /*val=*/0x20000000ul, /*len=*/4ul);

Let's limit the max value of dctcp_shift_g by param_set_uint_minmax().

With this patch:

  # echo 10 &gt; /sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g
  # cat /sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g
  10
  # echo 11 &gt; /sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g
  -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

ALSA: hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanup

Use the control private_free callback to free the associated data
block. This ensures that the memory won't leak, whatever way the
control gets destroyed.

The original implementation didn't actually remove the ALSA
controls in hda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internal
tracking structure. This meant it was possible to remove/unload the
amp driver while leaving its ALSA controls still present in the
soundcard. Obviously attempting to access them could cause segfaults
or at least dereferencing stale pointers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38390 | drm/msm/a6xx: Avoid a nullptr dereference when speedbin setting fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38390</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: Avoid a nullptr dereference when speedbin setting fails

Calling a6xx_destroy() before adreno_gpu_init() leads to a null pointer
dereference on:

msm_gpu_cleanup() : platform_set_drvdata(gpu-&gt;pdev, NULL);

as gpu-&gt;pdev is only assigned in:

a6xx_gpu_init()
|_ adreno_gpu_init
    |_ msm_gpu_init()

Instead of relying on handwavy null checks down the cleanup chain,
explicitly de-allocate the LLC data and free a6xx_gpu instead.

media: stk1160: fix bounds checking in stk1160_copy_video()

The subtract in this condition is reversed.  The -&gt;length is the length
of the buffer.  The -&gt;bytesused is how many bytes we have copied thus
far.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of the
subtraction is always negative but since it's unsigned then the result
is a very high positive value.  That means the overflow check is never
true.

Additionally, the -&gt;bytesused doesn't actually work for this purpose
because we're not writing to "buf-&gt;mem + buf-&gt;bytesused".  Instead, the
math to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bit
involved.  You calculate the number of full lines already written,
multiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd
numbered line, and add the offset into the line.

To fix this buffer overflow, just take the actual destination where we
are writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error and
return.  Otherwise, write up to buf-&gt;length bytes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38622 | drm/msm/dpu: Add callback function pointer check before its call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38622</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The warning is due to the FUSE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify sent by the write()
syscall in the reproducer program and it happens as follows:

(1) calls fuse_dev_read() to read the INIT request
The read succeeds. During the read, bit FR_SENT will be set on the
request.
(2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send an USE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify
The resend notify will resend all processing requests, so the INIT
request is moved from processing list to pending list again.
(3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output address
fuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the output
address, but it will fail due to the invalid address, so the INIT
request is ended and triggers the warning in fuse_request_end().

Fix it by clearing FR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38627 | stm class: Fix a double free in stm_register_device()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38627</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida

file_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly
during cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file
operations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty
file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.

Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of
file_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida
after it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.

Remove ida_destroy(&amp;amp;file_ida) to address these issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:34:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38630 | watchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38630</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: max3100: Update uart_driver_registered on driver removal

The removal of the last MAX3100 device triggers the removal of
the driver. However, code doesn't update the respective global
variable and after insmod — rmmod — insmod cycle the kernel
oopses:

  max3100 spi-PRP0001:01: max3100_probe: adding port 0
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000408

Update the actual state so next time UART driver will be registered
again.

Hugo also noticed, that the error path in the probe also affected
by having the variable set, and not cleared. Instead of clearing it
move the assignment after the successfull uart_register_driver() call.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:35:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38634 | serial: max3100: Lock port-&amp;gt;lock when calling uart_handle_cts_change()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38634</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset

For some reason, we add an offset to the PDI, presumably to skip the
PDI0 and PDI1 which are reserved for BPT.

This code is however completely wrong and leads to an out-of-bounds
access. We were just lucky so far since we used only a couple of PDIs
and remained within the PDI array bounds.

A Fixes: tag is not provided since there are no known platforms where
the out-of-bounds would be accessed, and the initial code had problems
as well.

A follow-up patch completely removes this useless offset.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:35:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38636 | f2fs: multidev: fix to recognize valid zero block address</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38636</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Shinichiro Kawasaki helps to analyse this issue and proposes a potential
fixing patch in [2].

Quoted from reply of Shinichiro Kawasaki:

"I confirmed that the trigger commit is dbf8e63f48af as Yi reported. I took a
look in the commit, but it looks fine to me. So I thought the cause is not
in the commit diff.

I found the WARN is printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices,
and read requests are mapped to the very first block of the second device in the
direct read path. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() and f2fs_map_blocks_cached()
modify map-&gt;m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. It
becomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,
f2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map-&gt;m_pblk is the physical block address of the
whole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map-&gt;m_pblk against
NULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets the invalid
iomap-&gt;length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap-&gt;length.

This WARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps.

 - Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB size each:
   nullb0 and nullb1.
 # mkfs.f2fs /dev/nullb0 -c /dev/nullb1
 # mount -t f2fs /dev/nullb0 "${mount_dir}"
 # dd if=/dev/zero of="${mount_dir}/test.dat" bs=1M count=192
 # dd if="${mount_dir}/test.dat" of=/dev/null bs=1M count=192 iflag=direct

..."

So, the root cause of this issue is: when multi-devices feature is on,
f2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr in non-primary device, which is
a verified valid block address, however, f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it as
an invalid block address, and then it triggers the warning in iomap
framework code.

Finally, as discussed, we decide to use a more simple and direct way that
checking (map.m_flags &amp; F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of
(map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix this issue.

Thanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki on this
issue.

enic: Validate length of nl attributes in enic_set_vf_port

enic_set_vf_port assumes that the nl attribute IFLA_PORT_PROFILE
is of length PORT_PROFILE_MAX and that the nl attributes
IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID, IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID are of length PORT_UUID_MAX.
These attributes are validated (in the function do_setlink in rtnetlink.c)
using the nla_policy ifla_port_policy. The policy defines IFLA_PORT_PROFILE
as NLA_STRING, IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID as NLA_BINARY and
IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID as NLA_STRING. That means that the length validation
using the policy is for the max size of the attributes and not on exact
size so the length of these attributes might be less than the sizes that
enic_set_vf_port expects. This might cause an out of bands
read access in the memcpys of the data of these
attributes in enic_set_vf_port.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 10:35:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3036 | Communication DoS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3036</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in ABB 800xA Base.
