Since Kvrocks didn't detect if "Host:" or "POST" appears in RESP requests,
a valid HTTP request can also be sent to Kvrocks as a valid RESP request 
and trigger some database operations, which can be dangerous when 
it is chained with SSRF.

It is similiar to CVE-2016-10517 in Redis.

This issue affects Apache Kvrocks: from the initial version to the latest version 2.11.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.1, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25071 | WordPress Vignette Ads plugin &amp;lt;= 0.2 - CSRF to Stored XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25071</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in topplugins Vignette Ads allows Stored XSS.

While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:50:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24787 | Parameter injection in DB connection URIs leading to local file inclusion in WhoDB</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24787</link><description>WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings, which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&amp;amp;allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:50:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22992 | A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the /feed/insert.json endpoint of the Emoncms project &gt;= 11.6.9.

In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL.

netfilter: nf_tables: don't skip expired elements during walk

There is an asymmetry between commit/abort and preparation phase if the
following conditions are met:

1. set is a verdict map ("1.2.3.4 : jump foo")
2. timeouts are enabled

In this case, following sequence is problematic:

1. element E in set S refers to chain C
2. userspace requests removal of set S
3. kernel does a set walk to decrement chain-&gt;use count for all elements
   from preparation phase
4. kernel does another set walk to remove elements from the commit phase
   (or another walk to do a chain-&gt;use increment for all elements from
    abort phase)

If E has already expired in 1), it will be ignored during list walk, so its use count
won't have been changed.

Then, when set is culled, -&gt;destroy callback will zap the element via
nf_tables_set_elem_destroy(), but this function is only safe for
elements that have been deactivated earlier from the preparation phase:
lack of earlier deactivate removes the element but leaks the chain use
count, which results in a WARN splat when the chain gets removed later,
plus a leak of the nft_chain structure.

Update pipapo_get() not to skip expired elements, otherwise flush
command reports bogus ENOENT errors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:19:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52925 | netfilter: nf_tables: don&amp;#x27;t fail inserts if duplicate has expired</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52925</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: don't fail inserts if duplicate has expired

nftables selftests fail:
run-tests.sh testcases/sets/0044interval_overlap_0
Expected: 0-2 . 0-3, got:
W: [FAILED]     ./testcases/sets/0044interval_overlap_0: got 1

Insertion must ignore duplicate but expired entries.

Moreover, there is a strange asymmetry in nft_pipapo_activate:

It refetches the current element, whereas the other -&gt;activate callbacks
(bitmap, hash, rhash, rbtree) use elem-&gt;priv.
Same for .remove: other set implementations take elem-&gt;priv,
nft_pipapo_remove fetches elem-&gt;priv, then does a relookup,
remove this.

I suspect this was the reason for the change that prompted the
removal of the expired check in pipapo_get() in the first place,
but skipping exired elements there makes no sense to me, this helper
is used for normal get requests, insertions (duplicate check)
and deactivate callback.

In first two cases expired elements must be skipped.

For -&gt;deactivate(), this gets called for DELSETELEM, so it
seems to me that expired elements should be skipped as well, i.e.
delete request should fail with -ENOENT error.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:19:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0167 | netrc and default credential leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0167</link><description>When asked to use a `.netrc` file for credentials **and** to follow HTTP
