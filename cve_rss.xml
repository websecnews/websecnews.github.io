In versions prior to 0.22.0, the use of an insecure key generation algorithm in the API key and beta (assistant/agent share auth) token generation process allows these tokens to be mutually derivable. Specifically, both tokens are generated using the same `URLSafeTimedSerializer` with predictable inputs, enabling an unauthorized user who obtains the shared assistant/agent URL to derive the personal API key. This grants them full control over the assistant/agent owner's account. Version 0.22.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 21:53:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7332 | PocketMine-MP &amp;lt; 4.18.1 Improper Validation of Dropped Item Count Allows Remote Server Crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7332</link><description>PocketMine-MP versions prior to 4.18.1 contain an improper input validation vulnerability in inventory transaction handling.

In the default emulated shell configuration, these command emulations perform real outbound HTTP requests to attacker-supplied destinations. Because no outbound request rate limiting was enforced, unauthenticated remote attackers could repeatedly invoke these commands to generate unbounded HTTP traffic toward arbitrary third-party targets, allowing the Cowrie honeypot to be abused as a denial-of-service amplification node and masking the attacker’s true source address behind the honeypot’s IP.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 21:44:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68700 | RAGFlow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68700</link><description>RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.23.0, a low-privileged authenticated user (normal login account) can execute arbitrary system commands on the server host process via the frontend Canvas CodeExec component, completely bypassing sandbox isolation. This occurs because untrusted data (stdout) is parsed using eval() with no filtering or sandboxing. The intended design was to "automatically convert string results into Python objects," but this effectively executes attacker-controlled code. Additional endpoints lack access control or contain inverted permission logic, significantly expanding the attack surface and enabling chained exploitation. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 21:33:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7331 | PKrystian Full-Stack-Bank User sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7331</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in PKrystian Full-Stack-Bank up to bf73a0179e3ff07c0d7dc35297cea0be0e5b1317.

The flaw is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the license management logic. The regService process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges, creates a fixed directory and writes files without verifying whether the path is an NTFS reparse point. By exploiting this race condition, an attacker can replace the target directory with a junction pointing to a user-controlled path. This causes the SYSTEM-level process to drop binaries in a location fully controlled by the attacker, allowing arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by any standard user with only a single UAC confirmation, making it highly practical and dangerous in real-world environments.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62079 | WordPress WP Export Categories &amp;amp; Taxonomies plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62079</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Damian WP Export Categories &amp; Taxonomies allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects WP Export Categories &amp;amp; Taxonomies: from n/a through 1.0.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62114 | WordPress Download Media Library plugin &amp;lt;= 0.2.1 - Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62114</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere vulnerability in Marcelo Torres Download Media Library allows Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data.This issue affects Download Media Library: from n/a through 0.2.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62116 | WordPress AI Copilot plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4.7 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62116</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Quadlayers AI Copilot allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects AI Copilot: from n/a through 1.4.7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62122 | WordPress Trash Duplicate and 301 Redirect plugin &amp;lt;= 1.9.1 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62122</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Solwininfotech Trash Duplicate and 301 Redirect allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects Trash Duplicate and 301 Redirect: from n/a through 1.9.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62126 | WordPress Varnish/Nginx Proxy Caching plugin &amp;lt;= 1.8.3 - Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62126</link><description>Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data vulnerability in Razvan Stanga Varnish/Nginx Proxy Caching allows Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data.This issue affects Varnish/Nginx Proxy Caching: from n/a through 1.8.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62154 | WordPress AI Content Writing Assistant (Content Writer, ChatGPT, Image Generator) All in One plugin &amp;lt;= 1.1.7 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62154</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Recorp AI Content Writing Assistant (Content Writer, ChatGPT, Image Generator) All in One allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects AI Content Writing Assistant (Content Writer, ChatGPT, Image Generator) All in One: from n/a through 1.1.7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62747 | WordPress Featured Image Generator plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62747</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Aum Watcharapon Featured Image Generator allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects Featured Image Generator: from n/a through 1.3.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15390 | PHPGurukul Small CRM edit-user.php authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15390</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in PHPGurukul Small CRM 4.0.

Prior to version 0.1.1, the application loads custom Python rules and configuration files from user-writable locations (e.g., `~/.config/theshit/`) without validating ownership or permissions when executed with elevated privileges. If the tool is invoked with `sudo` or otherwise runs with an effective UID of root, it continues to trust configuration files originating from the unprivileged user's environment. This allows a local attacker to inject arbitrary Python code via a malicious rule or configuration file, which is then executed with root privileges. Any system where this tool is executed with elevated privileges is affected. In environments where the tool is permitted to run via `sudo` without a password (`NOPASSWD`), a local unprivileged user can escalate privileges to root without additional interaction. The issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1. The patch introduces strict ownership and permission checks for all configuration files and custom rules. The application now enforces that rules are only loaded if they are owned by the effective user executing the tool. When executed with elevated privileges (`EUID=0`), the application refuses to load any files that are not owned by root or that are writable by non-root users. When executed as a non-root user, it similarly refuses to load rules owned by other users. This prevents both vertical and horizontal privilege escalation via execution of untrusted code. If upgrading is not possible, users should avoid executing the application with `sudo` or as the root user. As a temporary mitigation, ensure that directories containing custom rules and configuration files are owned by root and are not writable by non-root users. Administrators may also audit existing custom rules before running the tool with elevated privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:28:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15264 | FeehiCMS TimThumb timthumb.php server-side request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15264</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in FeehiCMS up to 2.1.1.

Starting in version 4.29.0 and prior to version 4.29.3, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Serverless Framework's built-in MCP server package (@serverless/mcp). This vulnerability only affects users of the experimental MCP server feature (serverless mcp), which represents less than 0.1% of Serverless Framework users. The core Serverless Framework CLI and deployment functionality are not affected. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings.

wifi: ath10k: add peer map clean up for peer delete in ath10k_sta_state()

When peer delete failed in a disconnect operation, use-after-free
detected by KFENCE in below log. It is because for each vdev_id and
address, it has only one struct ath10k_peer, it is allocated in
ath10k_peer_map_event(). When connected to an AP, it has more than
one HTT_T2H_MSG_TYPE_PEER_MAP reported from firmware, then the
array peer_map of struct ath10k will be set muti-elements to the
same ath10k_peer in ath10k_peer_map_event(). When peer delete failed
in ath10k_sta_state(), the ath10k_peer will be free for the 1st peer
id in array peer_map of struct ath10k, and then use-after-free happened
for the 2nd peer id because they map to the same ath10k_peer.

And clean up all peers in array peer_map for the ath10k_peer, then
user-after-free disappeared

wifi: ath9k: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_disconnect()

This patch fixes a use-after-free in ath9k that occurs in
ath9k_hif_usb_disconnect() when ath9k_destroy_wmi() is trying to access
'drv_priv' that has already been freed by ieee80211_free_hw(), called by
ath9k_htc_hw_deinit(). The patch moves ath9k_destroy_wmi() before
ieee80211_free_hw(). Note that urbs from the driver should be killed
before freeing 'wmi' with ath9k_destroy_wmi() as their callbacks will
access 'wmi'.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

drm: Prevent drm_copy_field() to attempt copying a NULL pointer

There are some struct drm_driver fields that are required by drivers since
drm_copy_field() attempts to copy them to user-space via DRM_IOCTL_VERSION.

But it can be possible that a driver has a bug and did not set some of the
fields, which leads to drm_copy_field() attempting to copy a NULL pointer:

mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value, the memory
that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() will be leaked and it will lead a kernel
crash because of deleting not added device in the remove path.

So fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which will call

btrfs: release path before inode lookup during the ino lookup ioctl

During the ino lookup ioctl we can end up calling btrfs_iget() to get an
inode reference while we are holding on a root's btree. If btrfs_iget()
needs to lookup the inode from the root's btree, because it's not
currently loaded in memory, then it will need to lock another or the
same path in the same root btree. This may result in a deadlock and
trigger the following lockdep splat:

KCSAN reported a data-race when accessing node-&gt;ref.

take this chance to use a more common READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()
pattern instead of data_race().

There is an existing bpf_lru_node_is_ref() and bpf_lru_node_set_ref().

media: av7110: prevent underflow in write_ts_to_decoder()

The buf[4] value comes from the user via ts_play().  It is a value in
the u8 range.  The final length we pass to av7110_ipack_instant_repack()
is "len - (buf[4] + 1) - 4" so add a check to ensure that the length is
not negative.  It's not clear that passing a negative len value does
anything bad necessarily, but it's not best practice.

With the new bounds checking the "if (!len)" condition is no longer
possible or required so remove that.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54285 | iomap: Fix possible overflow condition in iomap_write_delalloc_scan</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54285</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The issue only happends in the inmate linux when Jailhouse hypervisor
enabled. The test procedure is:
while true; do
	jailhouse enable imx8mp.cell
	jailhouse cell linux xxxx
	sleep 10
	jailhouse cell destroy 1
	jailhouse disable
	sleep 5
done

And during the upper test, press keys to the 2nd linux console.
When `jailhouse cell destroy 1`, the 2nd linux has no chance to put
the uart to a quiese state, so USR1/2 may has pending interrupts. Then
when `jailhosue cell linux xx` to start 2nd linux again, the issue
trigger.

In order to disable irqs before requesting them, both UCR1 and UCR2 irqs
should be disabled, so here fix that, disable the Ageing Timer interrupt
in UCR2 as UCR1 does.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54288 | wifi: mac80211: fortify the spinlock against deadlock by interrupt</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54288</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fortify the spinlock against deadlock by interrupt

In the function ieee80211_tx_dequeue() there is a particular locking
sequence:

begin:
	spin_lock(&amp;amp;local-&gt;queue_stop_reason_lock);
	q_stopped = local-&gt;queue_stop_reasons[q];
	spin_unlock(&amp;amp;local-&gt;queue_stop_reason_lock);

However small the chance (increased by ftracetest), an asynchronous
interrupt can occur in between of spin_lock() and spin_unlock(),
and the interrupt routine will attempt to lock the same
&amp;amp;local-&gt;queue_stop_reason_lock again.

This will cause a costly reset of the CPU and the wifi device or an
altogether hang in the single CPU and single core scenario.

The only remaining spin_lock(&amp;amp;local-&gt;queue_stop_reason_lock) that
did not disable interrupts was patched, which should prevent any
deadlocks on the same CPU/core and the same wifi device.

This is the probable trace of the deadlock:

bch_btree_check_thread() and bch_dirty_init_thread() may call
mca_cannibalize() to cannibalize other cached btree nodes. Only one thread
can do it at a time, so the op of other threads will be added to the
btree_cache_wait list.

We must call finish_wait() to remove op from btree_cache_wait before free
it's memory address. Otherwise, the list will be damaged. Also should call
bch_cannibalize_unlock() to release the btree_cache_alloc_lock and wake_up
other waiters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54294 | md/raid10: fix memleak of md thread</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54294</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: spi-nor: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in spi_nor_set_erase_type

spi_nor_set_erase_type() was used either to set or to mask out an erase
type. When we used it to mask out an erase type a shift-out-of-bounds
was hit:
UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/core.c:2237:24
shift exponent 4294967295 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

The setting of the size_{shift, mask} and of the opcode are unnecessary
when the erase size is zero, as throughout the code just the erase size
is considered to determine whether an erase type is supported or not.
Setting the opcode to 0xFF was wrong too as nobody guarantees that 0xFF
is an unused opcode. Thus when masking out an erase type, just set the
erase size to zero. This will fix the shift-out-of-bounds.

the guest, it also crashes the host due to the VMSA pointer being left
NULL.

btrfs: zoned: fix memory leak after finding block group with super blocks

At exclude_super_stripes(), if we happen to find a block group that has
super blocks mapped to it and we are on a zoned filesystem, we error out
as this is not supposed to happen, indicating either a bug or maybe some
memory corruption for example. However we are exiting the function without
freeing the memory allocated for the logical address of the super blocks.
Fix this by freeing the logical address.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54298 | thermal: intel: quark_dts: fix error pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54298</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: bus: verify partner exists in typec_altmode_attention

Some usb hubs will negotiate DisplayPort Alt mode with the device
but will then negotiate a data role swap after entering the alt
mode. The data role swap causes the device to unregister all alt
modes, however the usb hub will still send Attention messages
even after failing to reregister the Alt Mode. type_altmode_attention
currently does not verify whether or not a device's altmode partner
exists, which results in a NULL pointer error when dereferencing
the typec_altmode and typec_altmode_ops belonging to the altmode
partner.

Verify the presence of a device's altmode partner before sending
the Attention message to the Alt Mode driver.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54300 | wifi: ath9k: avoid referencing uninit memory in ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54300</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: avoid referencing uninit memory in ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx

For the reasons also described in commit b383e8abed41 ("wifi: ath9k: avoid
uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()"), ath9k_htc_rx_msg() should
validate pkt_len before accessing the SKB.

For example, the obtained SKB may have been badly constructed with
pkt_len = 8. In this case, the SKB can only contain a valid htc_frame_hdr
but after being processed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() and passed to
ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx() endpoint RX handler, it is expected to have a WMI
command header which should be located inside its data payload.

Implement sanity checking inside ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx(). Otherwise, uninit
memory can be referenced.

Tested on Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n .

bpf: Disable preemption in bpf_perf_event_output

The nesting protection in bpf_perf_event_output relies on disabled
preemption, which is guaranteed for kprobes and tracepoints.

However bpf_perf_event_output can be also called from uprobes context
through bpf_prog_run_array_sleepable function which disables migration,
but keeps preemption enabled.

This can cause task to be preempted by another one inside the nesting
protection and lead eventually to two tasks using same perf_sample_data
buffer and cause crashes like:

/dev/vtpmx is made visible before 'workqueue' is initialized, which can
lead to a memory corruption in the worst case scenario.

Address this by initializing 'workqueue' as the very first step of the
driver initialization.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:21:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54310 | scsi: message: mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54310</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: message: mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition

mptlan_probe() calls mpt_register_lan_device() which initializes the
&amp;amp;priv-&gt;post_buckets_task workqueue. A call to
mpt_lan_wake_post_buckets_task() will subsequently start the work.

During driver unload in mptlan_remove() the following race may occur:

CPU0                  CPU1

                    |mpt_lan_post_receive_buckets_work()

Fix this by finishing the work prior to cleaning up in mptlan_remove().

ext4: fix deadlock when converting an inline directory in nojournal mode

In no journal mode, ext4_finish_convert_inline_dir() can self-deadlock

ext4_incvert_inline_data_nolock() for data files which we'll fix at
the same time.

In af9005_i2c_xfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf

[ 8569.952973]  

The likely cause is that init_waitqueue_head() is called after the call to
the torture_create_kthread() function that creates the ref_scale_reader
kthread.  Although this init_waitqueue_head() call will very likely
complete before this kthread is created and starts running, it is
possible that the calling kthread will be delayed between the calls to
torture_create_kthread() and init_waitqueue_head().  In this case, the
new kthread will use the waitqueue head before it is properly initialized,
which is not good for the kernel's health and well-being.

The above crash happened here:

	static inline void __add_wait_queue(...)
	{
		:
		if (!(wq-&gt;flags &amp; WQ_FLAG_PRIORITY)) &lt;=== Crash here

The offset of flags from list_head entry in wait_queue_entry is
-0x18. If reader_tasks[i].wq.head.next is NULL as allocated reader_task
structure is zero initialized, the instruction will try to access address
0xffffffffffffffe8, which is exactly the fault address listed above.

This commit therefore invokes init_waitqueue_head() before creating
the kthread.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:22:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54317 | dm flakey: don&amp;#x27;t corrupt the zero page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54317</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm flakey: don't corrupt the zero page

When we need to zero some range on a block device, the function
__blkdev_issue_zero_pages submits a write bio with the bio vector pointing
to the zero page. If we use dm-flakey with corrupt bio writes option, it
will corrupt the content of the zero page which results in crashes of
various userspace programs. Glibc assumes that memory returned by mmap is
zeroed and it uses it for calloc implementation; if the newly mapped
memory is not zeroed, calloc will return non-zeroed memory.

Fix this bug by testing if the page is equal to ZERO_PAGE(0) and
avoiding the corruption in this case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:22:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54318 | net/smc: use smc_lgr_list.lock to protect smc_lgr_list.list iterate in smcr_port_add</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54318</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/pmem: Fix nvdimm registration races

A loop of the form:

    while true; do modprobe cxl_pci; modprobe -r cxl_pci; done

...fails with the following crash signature:

dm: fix a race condition in retrieve_deps

There's a race condition in the multipath target when retrieve_deps
races with multipath_message calling dm_get_device and dm_put_device.
retrieve_deps walks the list of open devices without holding any lock
but multipath may add or remove devices to the list while it is
running. The end result may be memory corruption or use-after-free
memory access.

See this description of a UAF with multipath_message():
https://listman.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2022-October/052373.html

Fix this bug by introducing a new rw semaphore "devices_lock". We grab
devices_lock for read in retrieve_deps and we grab it for write in
dm_get_device and dm_put_device.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:22:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54325 | crypto: qat - fix out-of-bounds read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54325</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - fix out-of-bounds read

When preparing an AER-CTR request, the driver copies the key provided by
the user into a data structure that is accessible by the firmware.
If the target device is QAT GEN4, the key size is rounded up by 16 since
a rounded up size is expected by the device.
If the key size is rounded up before the copy, the size used for copying
the key might be bigger than the size of the region containing the key,
causing an out-of-bounds read.

Fix by doing the copy first and then update the keylen.

This is to fix the following warning reported by KASAN:

ipv6: ensure sane device mtu in tunnels

Another syzbot report [1] with no reproducer hints
at a bug in ip6_gre tunnel (dev:ip6gretap0)

Since ipv6 mcast code makes sure to read dev-&gt;mtu once
and applies a sanity check on it (see commit b9b312a7a451
"ipv6: mcast: better catch silly mtu values"), a remaining
possibility is that a layer is able to set dev-&gt;mtu to
an underflowed value (high order bit set).

This could happen indeed in ip6gre_tnl_link_config_route(),
ip6_tnl_link_config() and ipip6_tunnel_bind_dev()

Make sure to sanitize mtu value in a local variable before
it is written once on dev-&gt;mtu, as lockless readers could
catch wrong temporary value.

The issue is that the per-device running_req read in
pm8001_dev_gone_notify() never goes to zero and we never make progress.
This is caused by missing accounting for running_req for when an internal
abort command completes.

In commit 2cbbf489778e ("scsi: pm8001: Use libsas internal abort support")
we started to send internal abort commands as a proper sas_task. In this
when we deliver a sas_task to HW the per-device running_req is incremented
in pm8001_queue_command(). However it is never decremented for internal
abort commnds, so decrement in pm8001_mpi_task_abort_resp().</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50819 | udmabuf: Set ubuf-&amp;gt;sg = NULL if the creation of sg table fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50819</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udmabuf: Set ubuf-&gt;sg = NULL if the creation of sg table fails

When userspace tries to map the dmabuf and if for some reason
(e.g. OOM) the creation of the sg table fails, ubuf-&gt;sg needs to be
set to NULL. Otherwise, when the userspace subsequently closes the
dmabuf fd, we'd try to erroneously free the invalid sg table from
release_udmabuf resulting in the following crash reported by syzbot:

ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in imgu_subdev_set_selection()

Calling v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop() and v4l2_subdev_get_try_compose()
with a subdev state of NULL leads to a NULL pointer dereference. This
can currently happen in imgu_subdev_set_selection() when the state
passed in is NULL, as this method first gets pointers to both the "try"
and "active" states and only then decides which to use.

The same issue has been addressed for imgu_subdev_get_selection() with
commit 30d03a0de650 ("ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active
selection access"). However the issue still persists in
imgu_subdev_set_selection().

Therefore, apply a similar fix as done in the aforementioned commit to
imgu_subdev_set_selection(). To keep things a bit cleaner, introduce
helper functions for "crop" and "compose" access and use them in both
imgu_subdev_set_selection() and imgu_subdev_get_selection().</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50827 | scsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak in lpfc_create_port()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50827</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak in lpfc_create_port()

Commit 5e633302ace1 ("scsi: lpfc: vmid: Add support for VMID in mailbox
command") introduced allocations for the VMID resources in
lpfc_create_port() after the call to scsi_host_alloc(). Upon failure on the
VMID allocations, the new code would branch to the 'out' label, which
returns NULL without unwinding anything, thus skipping the call to
scsi_host_put().

Fix the problem by creating a separate label 'out_free_vmid' to unwind the
VMID resources and make the 'out_put_shost' label call only
scsi_host_put(), as was done before the introduction of allocations for
VMID.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50828 | clk: zynqmp: Fix stack-out-of-bounds in strncpy`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50828</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

"BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in strncpy+0x30/0x68"

Linux-ATF interface is using 16 bytes of SMC payload. In case clock name is
longer than 15 bytes, string terminated NULL character will not be received

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb()

It is possible that skb is freed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg(), then
usb_submit_urb() fails and we try to free skb again. It causes
use-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb-&gt;context becomes
NULL but rx_buf is not freed and there can be a memory leak.

The patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb processing more clear: it
is supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes its
managing to another callback function.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50830 | auxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50830</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

auxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()

hd44780_probe() allocates a memory chunk for hd with kzalloc() and
makes "lcd-&gt;drvdata-&gt;hd44780" point to it. When we call hd44780_remove(),
we should release all relevant memory and resource. But "lcd-&gt;drvdata

wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free

commit ff05d4b45dd89b922578dac497dcabf57cf771c6

When we parse a multi-BSSID element, we might point some
element pointers into the allocated nontransmitted_profile.
However, we free this before returning, causing UAF when the
relevant pointers in the parsed elements are accessed.

Fix this by not allocating the scratch buffer separately but
as part of the returned structure instead, that way, there
are no lifetime issues with it.

The scratch buffer introduction as part of the returned data
here is taken from MLO feature work done by Ilan.

This fixes CVE-2022-42719.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50832 | wifi: wilc1000: fix potential memory leak in wilc_mac_xmit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50832</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: use hdev-&gt;workqueue when queuing hdev-&gt;{cmd,ncmd}_timer works

syzbot is reporting attempt to schedule hdev-&gt;cmd_work work from system_wq
WQ into hdev-&gt;workqueue WQ which is under draining operation [1], for
commit c8efcc2589464ac7 ("workqueue: allow chained queueing during

The check introduced by commit 877afadad2dce8aa ("Bluetooth: When HCI work
queue is drained, only queue chained work") was incomplete.

Use hdev-&gt;workqueue WQ when queuing hdev-&gt;{cmd,ncmd}_timer works because
hci_{cmd,ncmd}_timeout() calls queue_work(hdev-&gt;workqueue). Also, protect
the queuing operation with RCU read lock in order to avoid calling

net: stream: purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()

Changheon Lee reported TCP socket leaks, with a nice repro.

It seems we leak TCP sockets with the following sequence:

1) SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_ACK is enabled on the socket.

   Each ACK will cook an skb put in error queue, from __skb_tstamp_tx().
   __skb_tstamp_tx() is using skb_clone(), unless
   SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TSONLY was also requested.

2) If the application is also using MSG_ZEROCOPY, then we put in the
   error queue cloned skbs that had a struct ubuf_info attached to them.

   Whenever an struct ubuf_info is allocated, sock_zerocopy_alloc()
   does a sock_hold().

   As long as the cloned skbs are still in sk_error_queue,
   socket refcount is kept elevated.

3) Application closes the socket, while error queue is not empty.

Since tcp_close() no longer purges the socket error queue,
we might end up with a TCP socket with at least one skb in
error queue keeping the socket alive forever.

This bug can be (ab)used to consume all kernel memory
and freeze the host.

We need to purge the error queue, with proper synchronization
against concurrent writers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50839 | jbd2: fix potential buffer head reference count leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50839</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix type of second parameter in odn_edit_dpm_table() callback

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

There are only two implementations of -&gt;odn_edit_dpm_table() in 'struct
amd_pm_funcs': smu_od_edit_dpm_table() and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table(). One
has a second parameter type of 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND' and the
other uses 'u32'. Ultimately, smu_od_edit_dpm_table() calls
-&gt;od_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct pptable_funcs' and
pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() calls -&gt;odn_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct
pp_hwmgr_func', which both have a second parameter type of 'enum
PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND'.

Update the type parameter in both the prototype in 'struct amd_pm_funcs'
and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() to 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND', which
cleans up the warning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50845 | ext4: fix inode leak in ext4_xattr_inode_create() on an error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50845</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

it will lead two issues:
1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is leaked.
2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to
   delete device, but it's not added yet, it will lead a kernel
   crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().

Fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which
will call mmc_free_host().</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50847 | drm/bridge: it6505: Initialize AUX channel in it6505_i2c_probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50847</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

During device boot, the HPD interrupt could be triggered before the DRM
subsystem registers it6505 as a DRM bridge. In such cases, the driver
tries to access AUX channel and causes NULL pointer dereference.
Initializing the AUX channel earlier to prevent such error.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50848 | drivers: dio: fix possible memory leak in dio_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50848</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

During early boot, memblock reserves the pages for the ramoops reserved
memory node in DT that would otherwise be part of the direct lowmem
mapping. Pstore's ram backend reuses those reserved pages to change the
memory type (writeback or non-cached) by passing the pages to vmap()
(see pfn_to_page() usage in persistent_ram_vmap() for more details) with
specific flags. When read_kcore() starts iterating over the vmalloc
region, it runs over the virtual address that vmap() returned for
ramoops. In aligned_vread() the virtual address is passed to
vmalloc_to_page() which returns the page struct for the reserved lowmem
area. That lowmem page is passed to kmap_atomic(), which effectively
calls page_to_virt() that assumes a lowmem page struct must be directly
accessible with __va() and friends. These pages are mapped via vmap()
though, and the lowmem mapping was never made, so accessing them via the
lowmem virtual address oopses like above.

Let's side-step this problem by passing VM_IOREMAP to vmap(). This will
tell vread() to not include the ramoops region in the kcore. Instead the
area will look like a bunch of zeros. The alternative is to teach kmap()
about vmalloc areas that intersect with lowmem. Presumably such a change
isn't a one-liner, and there isn't much interest in inspecting the
ramoops region in kcore files anyway, so the most expedient route is
taken for now.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50850 | scsi: ipr: Fix WARNING in ipr_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50850</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: prevent leak of lsm program after failed attach

In [0], we added the ability to bpf_prog_attach LSM programs to cgroups,
but in our validation to make sure the prog is meant to be attached to
BPF_LSM_CGROUP, we return too early if the check fails. This results in
lack of decrementing prog's refcnt (through bpf_prog_put)
leaving the LSM program alive past the point of the expected lifecycle.
This fix allows for the decrement to take place.

this automatically now.

This oversight adds garbage past the end of the Reply message.
Clients typically ignore the garbage, but NFSD does not need to send

powerpc/rtas: avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()

rtas_os_term() is called during panic. Its behavior depends on a couple
of conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of
which entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics
while devtree_lock is held, rtas_os_term() as currently written could
hang.

Instead of discovering the relevant characteristics at panic time,
cache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for
"ibm,extended-os-term" is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it
is a boolean property, not an RTAS function token.

Bluetooth: ISO: fix iso_conn related locking and validity issues

sk-&gt;sk_state indicates whether iso_pi(sk)-&gt;conn is valid. Operations
that check/update sk_state and access conn should hold lock_sock,
otherwise they can race.

The order of taking locks is hci_dev_lock &gt; lock_sock &gt; iso_conn_lock,
which is how it is in connect/disconnect_cfm -&gt; iso_conn_del -&gt;
iso_chan_del.

Fix locking in iso_connect_cis/bis and sendmsg/recvmsg to take lock_sock
around updating sk_state and conn.

iso_conn_del must not occur during iso_connect_cis/bis, as it frees the
iso_conn. Hold hdev-&gt;lock longer to prevent that.

This should not reintroduce the issue fixed in commit 241f51931c35
("Bluetooth: ISO: Avoid circular locking dependency"), since the we
acquire locks in order. We retain the fix in iso_sock_connect to release
lock_sock before iso_connect_* acquires hdev-&gt;lock.

Similarly for commit 6a5ad251b7cd ("Bluetooth: ISO: Fix possible
circular locking dependency"). We retain the fix in iso_conn_ready to
not acquire iso_conn_lock before lock_sock.

iso_conn_add shall return iso_conn with valid hcon. Make it so also when
reusing an old CIS connection waiting for disconnect timeout (see
__iso_sock_close where conn-&gt;hcon is set to NULL).

After some investigation, I have found the following issue: unlike other
zswap backends, zsmalloc performs the LRU list update at the object
mapping time, rather than when the slot for the object is allocated.
This deviation was discussed and agreed upon during the review process
of the zsmalloc writeback patch series:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Y3flcAXNxxrvy3ZH@cmpxchg.org/

Unfortunately, this introduces a subtle bug that occurs when there is a
concurrent store and reclaim, which interleave as follows:

zswap_frontswap_store()            shrink_worker()
  zs_malloc()                        zs_zpool_shrink()
    spin_lock(&amp;amp;pool-&gt;lock)             zs_reclaim_page()
    zspage = find_get_zspage()
    spin_unlock(&amp;amp;pool-&gt;lock)
                                         spin_lock(&amp;amp;pool-&gt;lock)
                                         zspage = list_first_entry(&amp;amp;pool-&gt;lru)

igc: Fix Kernel Panic during ndo_tx_timeout callback

The Xeon validation group has been carrying out some loaded tests
with various HW configurations, and they have seen some transmit
queue time out happening during the test. This will cause the
reset adapter function to be called by igc_tx_timeout().
Similar race conditions may arise when the interface is being brought
down and up in igc_reinit_locked(), an interrupt being generated, and
igc_clean_tx_irq() being called to complete the TX.

When the igc_tx_timeout() function is invoked, this patch will turn
off all TX ring HW queues during igc_down() process. TX ring HW queues
will be activated again during the igc_configure_tx_ring() process
when performing the igc_up() procedure later.

This patch also moved existing igc_disable_tx_ring_hw() to avoid using
forward declaration.

m68k: mm: Move initrd phys_to_virt handling after paging_init()

When booting with an initial ramdisk on platforms where physical memory
does not start at address zero (e.g. on Amiga):

    initrd: 0ef0602c - 0f800000
    Zone ranges:
      DMA      [mem 0x0000000008000000-0x000000f7ffffffff]
      Normal   empty
    Movable zone start for each node
    Early memory node ranges
      node   0: [mem 0x0000000008000000-0x000000000f7fffff]
    Initmem setup node 0 [mem 0x0000000008000000-0x000000000f7fffff]

    Oops: 00000000
    Modules linked in:
    PC: [&lt;00201d3c&gt;] memcmp+0x28/0x56

As phys_to_virt() relies on m68k_memoffset and module_fixup(), it must
not be called before paging_init().  Hence postpone the phys_to_virt
handling for the initial ramdisk until after calling paging_init().

While at it, reduce #ifdef clutter by using IS_ENABLED() instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54168 | RDMA/mlx4: Prevent shift wrapping in set_user_sq_size()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54168</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

keys: Fix linking a duplicate key to a keyring's assoc_array

When making a DNS query inside the kernel using dns_query(), the request
code can in rare cases end up creating a duplicate index key in the
assoc_array of the destination keyring. It is eventually found by
a BUG_ON() check in the assoc_array implementation and results in
a crash.

The situation occurs as follows:
* Some kernel facility invokes dns_query() to resolve a hostname, for
  example, "abcdef". The function registers its global DNS resolver
  cache as current-&gt;cred.thread_keyring and passes the query to
  request_key_net() -&gt; request_key_tag() -&gt; request_key_and_link().
* Function request_key_and_link() creates a keyring_search_context
  object. Its match_data.cmp method gets set via a call to
  type-&gt;match_preparse() (resolves to dns_resolver_match_preparse()) to
  dns_resolver_cmp().
* Function request_key_and_link() continues and invokes
  search_process_keyrings_rcu() which returns that a given key was not
  found. The control is then passed to request_key_and_link() -&gt;
  construct_alloc_key().
* Concurrently to that, a second task similarly makes a DNS query for
  "abcdef." and its result gets inserted into the DNS resolver cache.
* Back on the first task, function construct_alloc_key() first runs
  __key_link_begin() to determine an assoc_array_edit operation to
  insert a new key. Index keys in the array are compared exactly as-is,

x86/hyperv: Disable IBT when hypercall page lacks ENDBR instruction

On hardware that supports Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT), Hyper-V VMs
with ConfigVersion 9.3 or later support IBT in the guest. However,
current versions of Hyper-V have a bug in that there's not an ENDBR64
instruction at the beginning of the hypercall page. Since hypercalls are
made with an indirect call to the hypercall page, all hypercall attempts
fail with an exception and Linux panics.

A Hyper-V fix is in progress to add ENDBR64. But guard against the Linux
panic by clearing X86_FEATURE_IBT if the hypercall page doesn't start
with ENDBR. The VM will boot and run without IBT.

If future Linux 32-bit kernels were to support IBT, additional hypercall
page hackery would be needed to make IBT work for such kernels in a
Hyper-V VM.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:31:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54173 | bpf: Disable preemption in bpf_event_output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54173</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Disable preemption in bpf_event_output

We received report [1] of kernel crash, which is caused by
using nesting protection without disabled preemption.

The bpf_event_output can be called by programs executed by
bpf_prog_run_array_cg function that disabled migration but
keeps preemption enabled.

This can cause task to be preempted by another one inside the
nesting protection and lead eventually to two tasks using same
perf_sample_data buffer and cause crashes like:

currently one error path where the function exits directly, which leads to
a leak of the runtime PM reference.

[BUG]
There is a bug report that a BUG_ON() in btrfs_repair_io_failure()

[CAUSE]

Before the BUG_ON(), we got some read errors from the replace target
first, note the mirror number (3, which is beyond RAID1 duplication,
thus it's read from the replace target device).

Then at the BUG_ON() location, we are trying to writeback the repaired
sectors back the failed device.

The check looks like this:

		ret = btrfs_map_block(fs_info, BTRFS_MAP_WRITE, logical,
				      &amp;amp;map_length, &amp;amp;bioc, mirror_num);
		if (ret)
			goto out_counter_dec;
		BUG_ON(mirror_num != bioc-&gt;mirror_num);

But inside btrfs_map_block(), we can modify bioc-&gt;mirror_num especially
for dev-replace:

	if (dev_replace_is_ongoing &amp;&amp; mirror_num == map-&gt;num_stripes + 1 &amp;&amp;
	    !need_full_stripe(op) &amp;&amp; dev_replace-&gt;tgtdev != NULL) {
		ret = get_extra_mirror_from_replace(fs_info, logical, *length,
						    dev_replace-&gt;srcdev-&gt;devid,
						    &amp;amp;mirror_num,
					    &amp;amp;physical_to_patch_in_first_stripe);
		patch_the_first_stripe_for_dev_replace = 1;
	}

Thus if we're repairing the replace target device, we're going to
trigger that BUG_ON().

But in reality, the read failure from the replace target device may be
that, our replace hasn't reached the range we're reading, thus we're
reading garbage, but with replace running, the range would be properly
filled later.

Thus in that case, we don't need to do anything but let the replace
routine to handle it.

[FIX]
Instead of a BUG_ON(), just skip the repair if we're repairing the
device replace target device.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54181 | bpf: Fix issue in verifying allow_ptr_leaks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54181</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix issue in verifying allow_ptr_leaks

After we converted the capabilities of our networking-bpf program from
cap_sys_admin to cap_net_admin+cap_bpf, our networking-bpf program
failed to start. Because it failed the bpf verifier, and the error log
is "R3 pointer comparison prohibited".

A simple reproducer as follows,

SEC("cls-ingress")
int ingress(struct __sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct iphdr *iph = (void *)(long)skb-&gt;data + sizeof(struct ethhdr);

	if ((long)(iph + 1) &gt; (long)skb-&gt;data_end)
		return TC_ACT_STOLEN;
	return TC_ACT_OK;
}

Per discussion with Yonghong and Alexei [1], comparison of two packet
pointers is not a pointer leak. This patch fixes it.

Our local kernel is 6.1.y and we expect this fix to be backported to
6.1.y, so stable is CCed.

f2fs: fix to check readonly condition correctly

With below case, it can mount multi-device image w/ rw option, however
one of secondary device is set as ro, later update will cause panic, so
let's introduce f2fs_dev_is_readonly(), and check multi-devices rw status
in f2fs_remount() w/ it in order to avoid such inconsistent mount status.

mkfs.f2fs -c /dev/zram1 /dev/zram0 -f
blockdev --setro /dev/zram1

At add_new_free_space() we have these BUG_ON()'s that are there to deal

Such failures are mostly -ENOMEM that should be very rare. However there's
no need to have these BUG_ON()'s, we can just return any error to the
caller and all callers and their upper call chain are already dealing with
errors.

So just make add_new_free_space() return any errors, while removing the
BUG_ON()'s, and returning the total amount of added free space to an
optional u64 pointer argument.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54186 | usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: fix pin_assignment_show</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54186</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: cls_api: remove block_cb from driver_list before freeing

Error handler of tcf_block_bind() frees the whole bo-&gt;cb_list on error.
However, by that time the flow_block_cb instances are already in the driver
list because driver ndo_setup_tc() callback is called before that up the
call chain in tcf_block_offload_cmd(). This leaves dangling pointers to
freed objects in the list and causes use-after-free[0]. Fix it by also
removing flow_block_cb instances from driver_list before deallocating them.

exfat: use kvmalloc_array/kvfree instead of kmalloc_array/kfree

The call stack shown below is a scenario in the Linux 4.19 kernel.
Allocating memory failed where exfat fs use kmalloc_array due to
system memory fragmentation, while the u-disk was inserted without
recognition.
Devices such as u-disk using the exfat file system are pluggable and
may be insert into the system at any time.
However, long-term running systems cannot guarantee the continuity of
physical memory. Therefore, it's necessary to address this issue.

rxrpc: Fix timeout of a call that hasn't yet been granted a channel

afs_make_call() calls rxrpc_kernel_begin_call() to begin a call (which may
get stalled in the background waiting for a connection to become
available); it then calls rxrpc_kernel_set_max_life() to set the timeouts -
but that starts the call timer so the call timer might then expire before
we get a connection assigned - leading to the following oops if the call
stalled:

	BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

Fix this by noting the timeouts in struct rxrpc_call when the call is
created.  The timer will be started when the first packet is transmitted.

It shouldn't be possible to trigger this directly from userspace through

netfilter: nf_tables: always release netdev hooks from notifier

This reverts "netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal".

The problem is that when a veth device is released, the veth release
callback will also queue the peer netns device for removal.

Its possible that the peer netns is also slated for removal.  In this
case, the device memory is already released before the pre_exit hook of
the peer netns runs:

Order is:
1. First netns is released, veth_dellink() queues peer netns device
   for removal
2. peer netns is queued for removal
3. peer netns device is released, unreg event is triggered
4. unreg event is ignored because netns is going down
5. pre_exit hook calls nft_netdev_unregister_hooks but device memory
   might be free'd already.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54201 | RDMA/efa: Fix wrong resources deallocation order</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54201</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/efa: Fix wrong resources deallocation order

When trying to destroy QP or CQ, we first decrease the refcount and
potentially free memory regions allocated for the object and then
request the device to destroy the object. If the device fails, the
object isn't fully destroyed so the user/IB core can try to destroy the
object again which will lead to underflow when trying to decrease an
already zeroed refcount.

Deallocate resources in reverse order of allocating them to safely free
them.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54202 | drm/i915: fix race condition UAF in i915_perf_add_config_ioctl</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54202</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Userspace can guess the id value and try to race oa_config object creation
with config remove, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference the
object after unlocking the metrics_lock.  For that reason, unlocking the
metrics_lock must be done after we are done dereferencing the object.

When smb1 mount fails, KASAN detect slab-out-of-bounds in
init_smb2_rsp_hdr like the following one.
For smb1 negotiate(56bytes) , init_smb2_rsp_hdr() for smb2 is called.
The issue occurs while handling smb1 negotiate as smb2 server operations.
Add smb server operations for smb1 (get_cmd_val, init_rsp_hdr,
allocate_rsp_buf, check_user_session) to handle smb1 negotiate so that
smb2 server operation does not handle it.

net/sched: flower: fix filter idr initialization

The cited commit moved idr initialization too early in fl_change() which
allows concurrent users to access the filter that is still being
initialized and is in inconsistent state, which, in turn, can cause NULL
pointer dereference [0]. Since there is no obvious way to fix the ordering
without reverting the whole cited commit, alternative approach taken to
first insert NULL pointer into idr in order to allocate the handle but
still cause fl_get() to return NULL and prevent concurrent users from

HID: uclogic: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name

Reference the HID device rather than the input device for the devm
allocation of the input_dev name. Referencing the input_dev would lead to a
use-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a
uevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the
name would be freed by devres management.

Use devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and
formatting the input_dev name string.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54208 | media: ov5675: Fix memleak in ov5675_init_controls()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54208</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix blktrace debugfs entries leakage

Commit 99d055b4fd4b ("block: remove per-disk debugfs files in
blk_unregister_queue") moves blk_trace_shutdown() from
blk_release_queue() to blk_unregister_queue(), this is safe if blktrace
is created through sysfs, however, there is a regression in corner
case.

blktrace can still be enabled after del_gendisk() through ioctl if
the disk is opened before del_gendisk(), and if blktrace is not shutdown
through ioctl before closing the disk, debugfs entries will be leaked.

Fix this problem by shutdown blktrace in disk_release(), this is safe
because blk_trace_remove() is reentrant.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54210 | Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_remove_adv_monitor()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54210</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_remove_adv_monitor()

KASAN reports that there's a use-after-free in
hci_remove_adv_monitor(). Trawling through the disassembly, you can
see that the complaint is from the access in bt_dev_dbg() under the
HCI_ADV_MONITOR_EXT_MSFT case. The problem case happens because
msft_remove_monitor() can end up freeing the monitor
structure. Specifically:
  hci_remove_adv_monitor() -&gt;
  msft_remove_monitor() -&gt;
  msft_remove_monitor_sync() -&gt;
  msft_le_cancel_monitor_advertisement_cb() -&gt;
  hci_free_adv_monitor()

Let's fix the problem by just stashing the relevant data when it's
still valid.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54211 | tracing: Fix warning in trace_buffered_event_disable()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54211</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix warning in trace_buffered_event_disable()

Warning happened in trace_buffered_event_disable() at

The cause of the warning is in __ftrace_event_enable_disable(),
trace_buffered_event_enable() was called once while
trace_buffered_event_disable() was called twice.
Reproduction script show as below, for analysis, see the comments:
 ```
 #!/bin/bash

 cd /sys/kernel/tracing/

 # 1. Register a 'disable_event' command, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was set;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_enable() was called first time;
 echo 'cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' &gt; \
     set_ftrace_filter

 # 2. Enable the event registered, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called first time;
 echo 1 &gt; events/initcall/initcall_finish/enable

 # 3. Try to call into cmdline_proc_show(), then SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was
 #    set again!!!
 cat /proc/cmdline

 # 4. Unregister the 'disable_event' command, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared again;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called second time!!!
 echo '!cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' &gt; \
     set_ftrace_filter
 ```

To fix it, IIUC, we can change to call trace_buffered_event_enable() at
fist time soft-mode enabled, and call trace_buffered_event_disable() at
last time soft-mode disabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54212 | ALSA: pcm: Move rwsem lock inside snd_ctl_elem_read to prevent UAF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54212</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Move rwsem lock inside snd_ctl_elem_read to prevent UAF

[ Note: this is a fix that works around the bug equivalently as the
  two upstream commits:
   1fa4445f9adf ("ALSA: control - introduce snd_ctl_notify_one() helper")
   56b88b50565c ("ALSA: pcm: Move rwsem lock inside snd_ctl_elem_read to prevent UAF")
  but in a simpler way to fit with older stable trees -- tiwai ]

Add missing locking in ctl_elem_read_user/ctl_elem_write_user which can be
easily triggered and turned into an use-after-free.

Example code paths with SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_READ:

64-bits:
snd_ctl_ioctl
  snd_ctl_elem_read_user
    [takes controls_rwsem]
    snd_ctl_elem_read [lock properly held, all good]
    [drops controls_rwsem]

32-bits (compat):
snd_ctl_ioctl_compat
  snd_ctl_elem_write_read_compat
    ctl_elem_write_read
      snd_ctl_elem_read [missing lock, not good]

Revert "drm/msm: Add missing check and destroy for alloc_ordered_workqueue"

This reverts commit 643b7d0869cc7f1f7a5ac7ca6bd25d88f54e31d0.

A recent patch that tried to fix up the msm_drm_init() paths with
respect to the workqueue but only ended up making things worse:

First, the newly added calls to msm_drm_uninit() on early errors would
trigger NULL-pointer dereferences, for example, as the kms pointer would
not have been initialised. (Note that these paths were also modified by
a second broken error handling patch which in effect cancelled out this
part when merged.)

Second, the newly added allocation sanity check would still leak the
previously allocated drm device.

Instead of trying to salvage what was badly broken (and clearly not
tested), let's revert the bad commit so that clean and backportable
fixes can be added in its place.

serial: 8250: Fix oops for port-&gt;pm on uart_change_pm()

Unloading a hardware specific 8250 driver can produce error "Unable to
handle kernel paging request at virtual address" about ten seconds after
unloading the driver. This happens on uart_hangup() calling
uart_change_pm().

Turns out commit 04e82793f068 ("serial: 8250: Reinit port-&gt;pm on port
specific driver unbind") was only a partial fix. If the hardware specific
driver has initialized port-&gt;pm function, we need to clear port-&gt;pm too.
Just reinitializing port-&gt;ops does not do this. Otherwise serial8250_pm()
will call port-&gt;pm() instead of serial8250_do_pm().</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54221 | clk: imx93: fix memory leak and missing unwind goto in imx93_clocks_probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54221</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: imx93: fix memory leak and missing unwind goto in imx93_clocks_probe

In function probe(), it returns directly without unregistered hws
when error occurs.

Fix this by adding 'goto unregister_hws;' on line 295 and
line 310.

Use devm_kzalloc() instead of kzalloc() to automatically
free the memory using devm_kfree() when error occurs.

Replace of_iomap() with devm_of_iomap() to automatically
handle the unused ioremap region and delete 'iounmap(anatop_base);'
in unregister_hws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54222 | hte: tegra-194: Fix off by one in tegra_hte_map_to_line_id()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54222</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: xsk: Fix invalid buffer access for legacy rq

The below crash can be encountered when using xdpsock in rx mode for
legacy rq: the buffer gets released in the XDP_REDIRECT path, and then
once again in the driver. This fix sets the flag to avoid releasing on
the driver side.

XSK handling of buffers for legacy rq was relying on the caller to set
the skip release flag. But the referenced fix started using fragment
counts for pages instead of the skip flag.

btrfs: fix lockdep splat and potential deadlock after failure running delayed items

When running delayed items we are holding a delayed node's mutex and then
we will attempt to modify a subvolume btree to insert/update/delete the
delayed items. However if have an error during the insertions for example,
btrfs_insert_delayed_items() may return with a path that has locked extent
buffers (a leaf at the very least), and then we attempt to release the
delayed node at __btrfs_run_delayed_items(), which requires taking the
delayed node's mutex, causing an ABBA type of deadlock. This was reported
by syzbot and the lockdep splat is the following:

net: ipa: only reset hashed tables when supported

Last year, the code that manages GSI channel transactions switched
from using spinlock-protected linked lists to using indexes into the
ring buffer used for a channel.  Recently, Google reported seeing
transaction reference count underflows occasionally during shutdown.

Doug Anderson found a way to reproduce the issue reliably, and
bisected the issue to the commit that eliminated the linked lists
and the lock.  The root cause was ultimately determined to be
related to unused transactions being committed as part of the modem
shutdown cleanup activity.  Unused transactions are not normally
expected (except in error cases).

The modem uses some ranges of IPA-resident memory, and whenever it
shuts down we zero those ranges.  In ipa_filter_reset_table() a
transaction is allocated to zero modem filter table entries.  If
hashing is not supported, hashed table memory should not be zeroed.
But currently nothing prevents that, and the result is an unused
transaction.  Something similar occurs when we zero routing table
entries for the modem.

By preventing any attempt to clear hashed tables when hashing is not
supported, the reference count underflow is avoided in this case.

Note that there likely remains an issue with properly freeing unused
transactions (if they occur due to errors).  This patch addresses
only the underflows that Google originally reported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54226 | af_unix: Fix data races around sk-&amp;gt;sk_shutdown.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54226</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix tags leak when shrink nr_hw_queues

Although we don't need to realloc set-&gt;tags[] when shrink nr_hw_queues,
we need to free them. Or these tags will be leaked.

How to reproduce:
1. mount -t configfs configfs /mnt
2. modprobe null_blk nr_devices=0 submit_queues=8
3. mkdir /mnt/nullb/nullb0
4. echo 1 &gt; /mnt/nullb/nullb0/power
5. echo 4 &gt; /mnt/nullb/nullb0/submit_queues
6. rmdir /mnt/nullb/nullb0

In step 4, will alloc 9 tags (8 submit queues and 1 poll queue), then
in step 5, new_nr_hw_queues = 5 (4 submit queues and 1 poll queue).
At last in step 6, only these 5 tags are freed, the other 4 tags leaked.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54228 | regulator: raa215300: Fix resource leak in case of error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54228</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The clk_register_clkdev() allocates memory by calling vclkdev_alloc() and
this memory is not freed in the error path. Similarly, resources allocated
by clk_register_fixed_rate() are not freed in the error path.

Fix these issues by using devm_clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() and
devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev().

After this, the static variable clk is not needed. Replace it with 
local variable hw in probe() and drop calling clk_unregister_fixed_rate()

m68k: Only force 030 bus error if PC not in exception table

__get_kernel_nofault() does copy data in supervisor mode when
forcing a task backtrace log through /proc/sysrq_trigger.
This is expected cause a bus error exception on e.g. NULL
pointer dereferencing when logging a kernel task has no
workqueue associated. This bus error ought to be ignored.

Our 030 bus error handler is ill equipped to deal with this:

Whenever ssw indicates a kernel mode access on a data fault,
we don't even attempt to handle the fault and instead always
send a SEGV signal (or panic). As a result, the check
for exception handling at the fault PC (buried in
send_sig_fault() which gets called from do_page_fault()
eventually) is never used.

In contrast, both 040 and 060 access error handlers do not
care whether a fault happened on supervisor mode access,
and will call do_page_fault() on those, ultimately honoring
the exception table.

Add a check in bus_error030 to call do_page_fault() in case
we do have an entry for the fault PC in our exception table.

I had attempted a fix for this earlier in 2019 that did rely
on testing pagefault_disabled() (see link below) to achieve
the same thing, but this patch should be more generic.

Tested on 030 Atari Falcon.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54233 | ASoC: SOF: avoid a NULL dereference with unsupported widgets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54233</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 0000000097d23782 object type: work_struct hint: doe_statemachine_work+0x0/0x510

   doe_statemachine_work+0x45e/0x510
   process_one_work+0x1d4/0x3c0

This occurs because destroy_work_on_stack() was called after signaling
the completion in the calling thread.  This creates a race between
destroy_work_on_stack() and the task-&gt;work struct going out of scope in
pci_doe().

Signal the work complete after destroying the work struct.  This is safe
because signal_task_complete() is the final thing the work item does and
the workqueue code is careful not to access the work struct after.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54236 | net/net_failover: fix txq exceeding warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54236</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/net_failover: fix txq exceeding warning

The failover txq is inited as 16 queues.
when a packet is transmitted from the failover device firstly,
the failover device will select the queue which is returned from
the primary device if the primary device is UP and running.
If the primary device txq is bigger than the default 16,
it can lead to the following warning:
eth0 selects TX queue 18, but real number of TX queues is 16

The warning backtrace is:

The reason here is that when the server tries to create a second link,
smc_llc_srv_add_link() has no protection and may add a new link to

llc_conf_mutex.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54238 | mlx5: fix skb leak while fifo resync and push</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54238</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlx5: fix skb leak while fifo resync and push

During ptp resync operation SKBs were poped from the fifo but were never
freed neither by napi_consume nor by dev_kfree_skb_any. Add call to
napi_consume_skb to properly free SKBs.

Another leak was happening because mlx5e_skb_fifo_has_room() had an error
in the check. Comparing free running counters works well unless C promotes
the types to something wider than the counter. In this case counters are
u16 but the result of the substraction is promouted to int and it causes
wrong result (negative value) of the check when producer have already
overlapped but consumer haven't yet. Explicit cast to u16 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54239 | iommufd: Check for uptr overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54239</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzkaller found that setting up a map with a user VA that wraps past zero

due to invalid arguments.

Prevent creating a pages with a uptr and size that would math overflow.

netfilter: ebtables: fix table blob use-after-free

We are not allowed to return an error at this point.
Looking at the code it looks like ret is always 0 at this
point, but its not.

t = find_table_lock(net, repl-&gt;name, &amp;amp;ret, &amp;amp;ebt_mutex);

... this can return a valid table, with ret != 0.

This bug causes update of table-&gt;private with the new
blob, but then frees the blob right away in the caller.

Fix this by flushing the EC query workqueue when removing
custom query handlers.

With the following btf

  [2] PTR '(anon)' type_id=0
  [3] TYPE_TAG 'a' type_id=2
  [4] VAR 'a' type_id=3, linkage=static
and when the bpf_attr.btf_key_type_id = 1 (DECL_TAG),
the following WARN_ON_ONCE in btf_type_id_size() is triggered:
  if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!btf_type_is_modifier(size_type) &amp;&amp;
                   !btf_type_is_var(size_type)))
          return NULL;

Note that 'return NULL' is the correct behavior as we don't want
a DECL_TAG type to be used as a btf_{key,value}_type_id even
for the case like 'DECL_TAG -&gt; STRUCT'. So there
is no correctness issue here, we just want to silence warning.

To silence the warning, I added DECL_TAG as one of kinds in
btf_type_nosize() which will cause btf_type_id_size() returning
NULL earlier without the warning.

Confirm that the accessed pneg_ctxt-&gt;HashAlgorithms address sits within

eight byte smb2_neg_context header + (client controlled) DataLength are

net/sched: taprio: Limit TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_SCHED_CYCLE_TIME to INT_MAX.

syzkaller found zero division error [0] in div_s64_rem() called from
get_cycle_time_elapsed(), where sched-&gt;cycle_time is the divisor.

We have tests in parse_taprio_schedule() so that cycle_time will never
be 0, and actually cycle_time is not 0 in get_cycle_time_elapsed().

The problem is that the types of divisor are different; cycle_time is
s64, but the argument of div_s64_rem() is s32.

syzkaller fed this input and 0x100000000 is cast to s32 to be 0.

  @TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_SCHED_CYCLE_TIME={0xc, 0x8, 0x100000000}

We use s64 for cycle_time to cast it to ktime_t, so let's keep it and
set max for cycle_time.

While at it, we prevent overflow in setup_txtime() and add another
test in parse_taprio_schedule() to check if cycle_time overflows.

Also, we add a new tdc test case for this issue.

This is the same problem outlined in 17b17fcd6d44 ("btrfs:
set_page_extent_mapped after read_folio in btrfs_cont_expand") , and the
fix is the same.  I originally looked for the same pattern elsewhere in
our code, but mistakenly skipped over this code because I saw the page
cache readahead before we set_page_extent_mapped, not realizing that
this was only in the !page case, that we can still end up with a
!uptodate page and then do the btrfs_read_folio further down.

The fix here is the same as the above mentioned patch, move the
set_page_extent_mapped call to after the btrfs_read_folio() block to
make sure that we have the subpage blocksize stuff setup properly before
using the page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54254 | drm/ttm: Don&amp;#x27;t leak a resource on eviction error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54254</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Various SoCs of the SH3, SH4 and SH4A family, which use this driver,
feature a differing number of DMA channels, which can be distributed
between up to two DMAC modules. The existing implementation fails to
correctly accommodate for all those variations, resulting in wrong
channel offset calculations and leading to kernel panics.

Rewrite dma_base_addr() in order to properly calculate channel offsets

net: macb: fix a memory corruption in extended buffer descriptor mode

For quite some time we were chasing a bug which looked like a sudden
permanent failure of networking and mmc on some of our devices.
The bug was very sensitive to any software changes and even more to
any kernel debug options.

Finally we got a setup where the problem was reproducible with
CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y and it revealed the issue with the rx dma:

soundwire: bus: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_put() causing usage count underflow

This reverts commit
443a98e649b4 ("soundwire: bus: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()")

Change calls to pm_runtime_resume_and_get() back to pm_runtime_get_sync().
This fixes a usage count underrun caused by doing a pm_runtime_put() even
though pm_runtime_resume_and_get() returned an error.

The three affected functions ignore -EACCES error from trying to get
pm_runtime, and carry on, including a put at the end of the function.
But pm_runtime_resume_and_get() does not increment the usage count if it
returns an error. So in the -EACCES case you must not call
pm_runtime_put().

The documentation for pm_runtime_get_sync() says:
 "Consider using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() ...  as this is likely to
 result in cleaner code."

In this case I don't think it results in cleaner code because the
pm_runtime_put() at the end of the function would have to be conditional on
the return value from pm_runtime_resume_and_get() at the top of the
function.

pm_runtime_get_sync() doesn't have this problem because it always
increments the count, so always needs a put. The code can just flow through
and do the pm_runtime_put() unconditionally.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54260 | cifs: Fix lost destroy smbd connection when MR allocate failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54260</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is because icmp6hdr does not in skb linear region under the scenario
of SOCK_RAW socket. Access icmp6_hdr(skb)-&gt;icmp6_type directly will
trigger the uninit variable access bug.

Use a local variable icmp6_type to carry the correct value in different
scenarios.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54266 | media: dvb-usb: m920x: Fix a potential memory leak in m920x_i2c_xfer()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54266</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Rework lppaca_shared_proc() to avoid DEBUG_PREEMPT

lppaca_shared_proc() takes a pointer to the lppaca which is typically
accessed through get_lppaca().  With DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled, this leads
to checking if preemption is enabled, for example:

  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: grep/10693
  caller is lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0
  CPU: 4 PID: 10693 Comm: grep Not tainted 6.5.0-rc3 #2
  Call Trace:
    dump_stack_lvl+0x154/0x200 (unreliable)
    check_preemption_disabled+0x214/0x220
    lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0
    ...

This isn't actually a problem however, as it does not matter which
lppaca is accessed, the shared proc state will be the same.
vcpudispatch_stats_procfs_init() already works around this by disabling
preemption, but the lparcfg code does not, erroring any time
/proc/powerpc/lparcfg is accessed with DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled.

Instead of disabling preemption on the caller side, rework
lppaca_shared_proc() to not take a pointer and instead directly access
the lppaca, bypassing any potential preemption checks.

[mpe: Rework to avoid needing a definition in paca.h and lppaca.h]</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54268 | debugobjects: Don&amp;#x27;t wake up kswapd from fill_pool()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54268</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

debugobjects: Don't wake up kswapd from fill_pool()

syzbot is reporting a lockdep warning in fill_pool() because the allocation
from debugobjects is using GFP_ATOMIC, which is (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)
and therefore tries to wake up kswapd, which acquires kswapd_wait::lock.

Since fill_pool() might be called with arbitrary locks held, fill_pool()
should not assume that acquiring kswapd_wait::lock is safe.

Use __GFP_HIGH instead and remove __GFP_NORETRY as it is pointless for
!__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54269 | SUNRPC: double free xprt_ctxt while still in use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54269</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: double free xprt_ctxt while still in use

When an RPC request is deferred, the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is moved out
of the svc_rqst into the svc_deferred_req.
When the deferred request is revisited, the pointer is copied into
the new svc_rqst - and also remains in the svc_deferred_req.

In the (rare?) case that the request is deferred a second time, the old
svc_deferred_req is reused - it still has all the correct content.
However in that case the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is NOT cleared so that
when xpo_release_xprt is called, the ctxt is freed (UDP) or possible
added to a free list (RDMA).
When the deferred request is revisited for a second time, it will
reference this ctxt which may be invalid, and the free the object a
second time which is likely to oops.

So change svc_defer() to *always* clear rq_xprt_ctxt, and assert that
the value is now stored in the svc_deferred_req.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54270 | media: usb: siano: Fix use after free bugs caused by do_submit_urb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54270</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This happens because iocg-&gt;ioc is NULL. The field is initialized by
ioc_pd_init() and never cleared. The NULL deref is caused by
blkcg_activate_policy() installing blkg_policy_data before initializing it.

blkcg_activate_policy() was doing the following:

1. Allocate pd's for all existing blkg's and install them in blkg-&gt;pd[].
2. Initialize all pd's.
3. Online all pd's.

blkcg_activate_policy() only grabs the queue_lock and may release and
re-acquire the lock as allocation may need to sleep. ioc_weight_write()
grabs blkcg-&gt;lock and iterates all its blkg's. The two can race and if
ioc_weight_write() runs during #1 or between #1 and #2, it can encounter a
pd which is not initialized yet, leading to crash.

The crash can be reproduced with the following script:

  #!/bin/bash

  echo +io &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control
  systemd-run --unit touch-sda --scope dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1 iflag=direct
  echo 100 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/io.weight
  bash -c "echo '8:0 enable=1' &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.qos" &amp;
  sleep .2
  echo 100 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/io.weight

&gt; 		list_for_each_entry_reverse(blkg, &amp;amp;q-&gt;blkg_list, q_node)

I don't see a reason why all pd's should be allocated, initialized and
onlined together. The only ordering requirement is that parent blkgs to be
initialized and onlined before children, which is guaranteed from the
walking order. Let's fix the bug by allocating, initializing and onlining pd
for each blkg and holding blkcg-&gt;lock over initialization and onlining. This
ensures that an installed blkg is always fully initialized and onlined
removing the the race window.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54272 | fs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54272</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()

In a previous commit c1006bd13146, ni-&gt;mi.mrec in ni_write_inode()
could be NULL, and thus a NULL check is added for this variable.

However, in the same call stack, ni-&gt;mi.mrec can be also dereferenced
in ni_clear():

ntfs_evict_inode(inode)
  ni_write_inode(inode, ...)
    ni = ntfs_i(inode);
    is_rec_inuse(ni-&gt;mi.mrec) -&gt; Add a NULL check by previous commit
  ni_clear(ntfs_i(inode))
    is_rec_inuse(ni-&gt;mi.mrec) -&gt; No check

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may exist in ni_clear().
To fix it, a NULL check is added in this function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54273 | xfrm: Fix leak of dev tracker</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54273</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/srpt: Add a check for valid 'mad_agent' pointer

When unregistering MAD agent, srpt module has a non-null check
for 'mad_agent' pointer before invoking ib_unregister_mad_agent().
This check can pass if 'mad_agent' variable holds an error value.
The 'mad_agent' can have an error value for a short window when
srpt_add_one() and srpt_remove_one() is executed simultaneously.

In srpt module, added a valid pointer check for 'sport-&gt;mad_agent'
before unregistering MAD agent.

This issue can hit when RoCE driver unregisters ib_device

nfsd: move init of percpu reply_cache_stats counters back to nfsd_init_net

Commit f5f9d4a314da ("nfsd: move reply cache initialization into nfsd
startup") moved the initialization of the reply cache into nfsd startup,
but didn't account for the stats counters, which can be accessed before
nfsd is ever started. The result can be a NULL pointer dereference when
someone accesses /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats while nfsd is still
shut down.

This is a regression and a user-triggerable oops in the right situation:

- non-x86_64 arch
- /proc/fs/nfsd is mounted in the namespace
- nfsd is not started in the namespace
- unprivileged user calls "cat /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats"

Although this is easy to trigger on some arches (like aarch64), on
x86_64, calling this_cpu_ptr(NULL) evidently returns a pointer to the
fixed_percpu_data. That struct looks just enough like a newly
initialized percpu var to allow nfsd_reply_cache_stats_show to access
it without Oopsing.

Move the initialization of the per-net+per-cpu reply-cache counters
back into nfsd_init_net, while leaving the rest of the reply cache
allocations to be done at nfsd startup time.

Kudos to Eirik who did most of the legwork to track this down.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54277 | fbdev: udlfb: Fix endpoint check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54277</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The current approach for this issue failed to catch the problem
because it only checks for the existence of a bulk-OUT endpoint; it
doesn't check whether this endpoint is the one that the driver will
actually use.

We can fix the problem by instead checking that the endpoint used by
the driver does exist and is bulk-OUT.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:32:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54278 | s390/vmem: split pages when debug pagealloc is enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54278</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Versions 4.6.2r5 through 4.7.0-r4 have a bad random number generator for nonces and port randomization after refactoring. Additionally, random numbers aren't generated with openssl's RAND_bytes but libc's random() (if it's not running on Windows). When fetching about 50 sequential nonces (i.e., through sending 50 unauthenticated allocations requests) it is possible to completely reconstruct the current state of the random number generator, thereby predicting the next nonce. This allows authentication while spoofing IPs. An attacker can send authenticated messages without ever receiving the responses, including the nonce (requires knowledge of the credentials, which is e.g., often the case in IoT settings). Since the port randomization is deterministic given the pseudorandom seed, an attacker can exactly reconstruct the ports and, hence predict the randomization of the ports. If an attacker allocates a relay port, they know the current port, and they are able to predict the next relay port (at least if it is not used before). Commit 11fc465f4bba70bb0ad8aae17d6c4a63a29917d9 contains a fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15211 | code-projects Refugee Food Management System refugee.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15211</link><description>A flaw has been found in code-projects Refugee Food Management System 1.0.

SummaryThe arrayLimit option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (a[]=1&amp;amp;a[]=2), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using arrayLimit for DoS protection are vulnerable.

DetailsThe arrayLimit option only checks limits for indexed notation (a[0]=1&amp;amp;a[1]=2) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (a[]=1&amp;amp;a[]=2).

Vulnerable code (lib/parse.js:159-162):

if (root === '[]' &amp;&amp; options.parseArrays) {
    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check
}





Working code (lib/parse.js:175):

else if (index &lt;= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here
    obj = [];
    obj[index] = leaf;
}





The bracket notation handler at line 159 uses utils.combine([], leaf) without validating against options.arrayLimit, while indexed notation at line 175 checks index &lt;= options.arrayLimit before creating arrays.

PoCTest 1 - Basic bypass:

npm install qs





const qs = require('qs');
const result = qs.parse('a[]=1&amp;amp;a[]=2&amp;amp;a[]=3&amp;amp;a[]=4&amp;amp;a[]=5&amp;amp;a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });
console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)





Test 2 - DoS demonstration:

const qs = require('qs');
const attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&amp;amp;a[]=');
const result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });
console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)





Configuration:

  *  arrayLimit: 5 (test 1) or arrayLimit: 100 (test 2)
  *  Use bracket notation: a[]=value (not indexed a[0]=value)


ImpactDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using qs.parse() with user-controlled input and arrayLimit for protection.

Attack scenario:

  *  Attacker sends HTTP request: GET /api/search?filters[]=x&amp;amp;filters[]=x&amp;...&amp;amp;filters[]=x (100,000+ times)
  *  Application parses with qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })
  *  qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array
  *  Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive
  *  Service unavailable for all users
Real-world impact:

  *  Single malicious request can crash server
  *  No authentication required
  *  Easy to automate and scale
  *  Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:59:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15208 | code-projects Refugee Food Management System editrefugee.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15208</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in code-projects Refugee Food Management System 1.0.

Prior to version 1.11.1, when a server calls an upstream service using different auth tokens, axios-cache-interceptor returns incorrect cached responses, leading to authorization bypass. The cache key is generated only from the URL, ignoring request headers like `Authorization`. When the server responds with `Vary: Authorization` (indicating the response varies by auth token), the library ignores this, causing all requests to share the same cache regardless of authorization. Server-side applications (APIs, proxies, backend services) that use axios-cache-interceptor to cache requests to upstream services, handle requests from multiple users with different auth tokens, and upstream services replies on `Vary` to differentiate caches are affected. Browser/client-side applications (single user per browser session) are not affected. Services using different auth tokens to call upstream services will return incorrect cached data, bypassing authorization checks and leaking user data across different authenticated sessions. After `v1.11.1`, automatic `Vary` header support is now enabled by default. When server responds with `Vary: Authorization`, cache keys now include the authorization header value. Each user gets their own cache.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14728 | Rapid7 Velociraptor Directory Traversal Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14728</link><description>Rapid7 Velociraptor versions before 0.75.6 contain a directory traversal issue on Linux servers that allows a rogue client to upload a file which is written outside the datastore directory. Velociraptor is normally only allowed to write in the datastore directory. The issue occurs due to insufficient sanitization of directory names which end with a ".", only encoding the final "." AS "%2E".


Although files can be written to incorrect locations, the containing directory must end with "%2E". This limits the impact of this vulnerability, and prevents it from overwriting critical files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:14:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15201 | SohuTV CacheCloud WebResourceController.java redirectNoPower cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15201</link><description>A flaw has been found in SohuTV CacheCloud up to 3.2.0.

This allows an attacker to corrupt adjacent stack memory, crash the web server, and (under certain conditions) may enable arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:56:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13592 | Advanced Ads &amp;lt;= 2.0.14 - Authenticated (Editor+) Remote Code Execution via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13592</link><description>The Advanced Ads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 2.0.14 via the 'change-ad__content' shortcode parameter.

The Meshtastic firmware (starting from version 2.5) introduces asymmetric encryption (PKI) for direct messages, but when the `pki_encrypted` flag is missing, the firmware silently falls back to legacy AES-256-CTR channel encryption. This was an intentional decision to maintain backwards compatibility. However, the end-user applications, like Web app, iOS/Android app, and applications built on top of Meshtastic using the SDK, did not have a way to differentiate between end-to-end encrypted DMs and the legacy DMs. This creates a downgrade attack path where adversaries who know a shared channel key can craft and inject spoofed direct messages that are displayed as if they were PKC encrypted. Users are not given any feedback of whether a direct message was decrypted with PKI or with legacy symmetric encryption, undermining the expected security guarantees of the PKI rollout. Version 2.7.15 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:43:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68868 | WordPress Wp Text Slider Widget plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68868</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Codeaffairs Wp Text Slider Widget allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Wp Text Slider Widget: from n/a through 1.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:43:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68870 | WordPress CookieHint WP plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.0 - Local File Inclusion vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68870</link><description>Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in reDim GmbH CookieHint WP allows PHP Local File Inclusion.This issue affects CookieHint WP: from n/a through 1.0.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:43:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15195 | code-projects Assessment Management add-module.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15195</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in code-projects Assessment Management 1.0.

The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation and encoding of user-controllable data in the book comment module: unfiltered user input is stored in the backend database (book_comment table, commentContent field) and returned via API, then rendered directly into the page DOM via Vue 3's v-html directive without sanitization.

When an “instanceof” expression uses an array element access as the left-hand operand inside a for-in loop, the instructions implementation leaves an additional array reference on the stack rather than consuming it during OP_INSTANCEOF. As a result, OP_NEXT interprets the array as an iterator object and reads the iterCmd function pointer from an invalid structure, potentially causing a crash or enabling code execution depending on heap layout.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:54:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15192 | D-Link DWR-M920 formLtefotaUpgradeQuectel sub_415328 command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15192</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in D-Link DWR-M920 up to 1.1.50.
