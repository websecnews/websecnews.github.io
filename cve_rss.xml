A malicious user may potentially be able to impersonate the web service account or the account of a service using the API when connecting to the Therefore™ Server. If the malicious user gains this impersonation user access, then it is possible for them to access the documents stored in Therefore™. This impersonation is at application level (Therefore access level), not the operating system level.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:55:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40106 | comedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()

The comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation
`async-&gt;munge_chan %= async-&gt;cmd.chanlist_len` without first
checking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program submits a command with
chanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device
processes data in the interrupt handler path.

Add a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the
function, similar to the existing checks for !map and
CMDF_RAWDATA flag. When chanlist_len is zero, update
munge_count and return early, indicating the data was
handled without munging.

This prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:55:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12041 | ERI File Library &amp;lt;= 1.1.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Protected File Download</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12041</link><description>The ERI File Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'erifl_file' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0.

Prior to 1.113.0, a remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Git Node component available in both Cloud and Self-Hosted versions of n8n. When a malicious actor clones a remote repository containing a pre-commit hook, the subsequent use of the Commit operation in the Git Node can inadvertently trigger the hook’s execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the n8n environment, potentially compromising the system and any connected credentials or workflows. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.113.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:49:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61114 | 2nd Line Android App version v1.2.92 and before (package name com.mysecondline.app), developed by AutoBizLine, Inc., contains an improper ac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61114</link><description>2nd Line Android App version v1.2.92 and before (package name com.mysecondline.app), developed by AutoBizLine, Inc., contains an improper access control vulnerability in its authentication mechanism.

drm/sched: Fix potential double free in drm_sched_job_add_resv_dependencies

When adding dependencies with drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), that
function consumes the fence reference both on success and failure, so in
the latter case the dma_fence_put() on the error path (xarray failed to
expand) is a double free.

Interestingly this bug appears to have been present ever since
commit ebd5f74255b9 ("drm/sched: Add dependency tracking"), since the code
back then looked like this:

drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies():
...
       for (i = 0; i &lt; fence_count; i++) {
               ret = drm_sched_job_add_dependency(job, fences[i]);
               if (ret)
                       break;
       }

       for (; i &lt; fence_count; i++)
               dma_fence_put(fences[i]);

Which means for the failing 'i' the dma_fence_put was already a double
free. Possibly there were no users at that time, or the test cases were
insufficient to hit it.

The bug was then only noticed and fixed after
commit 9c2ba265352a ("drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies v2")
landed, with its fixup of
commit 4eaf02d6076c ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies").

At that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which
commit 963d0b356935 ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder")
noticed and attempted to fix.

But it only moved the double free from happening inside the
drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), when releasing the reference not yet
obtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference already released by
the former in the failure case.

As such it is not easy to identify the right target for the fixes tag so
lets keep it simple and just continue the chain.

While fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking
the reference and not dropping it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40097 | ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not assert we found block group item when creating free space tree

Currently, when building a free space tree at populate_free_space_tree(),
if we are not using the block group tree feature, we always expect to find
block group items (either extent items or a block group item with key type
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY) when we search the extent tree with
btrfs_search_slot_for_read(), so we assert that we found an item. However
this expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in
the current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have
not added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do
not have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.

The insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree
happens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper
insert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction
handle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as
part of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation
if we are low on free space).

So remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block
group tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this
case.

btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data profile without an RST

At the end of btrfs_load_block_group_zone_info() the first thing we do
is to ensure that if the mapping type is not a SINGLE one and there is
no RAID stripe tree, then we return early with an error.

Doing that, though, prevents the code from running the last calls from
this function which are about freeing memory allocated during its
run. Hence, in this case, instead of returning early, we set the ret
value and fall through the rest of the cleanup code.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40102 | KVM: arm64: Prevent access to vCPU events before init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40102</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Another day, another syzkaller bug. KVM erroneously allows userspace to

KVM interpreting a bunch of uninitialized garbage for routing /
injecting the exception.

In one case the injection code and the hyp disagree on whether the vCPU
has a 32bit EL1 and put the vCPU into an illegal mode for AArch64,

ixgbevf: fix mailbox API compatibility by negotiating supported features

There was backward compatibility in the terms of mailbox API. Various
drivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio
could easily negotiate mailbox API.

This convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.
Commit 0062e7cc955e ("ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code") added support
for IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the
rest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of
support was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such
code paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was
introduced along with introduction of the feature itself.

Commit 339f28964147 ("ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication
between PF and VF") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it
introduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API
version for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version
defined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,
as the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe
driver as it causes crashes.

The issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit
d0725312adf5 ("ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5").
As a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API
to version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.

To fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported
features. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec
and ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.

New mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API
revision, as API version of OOT PF &amp; VF drivers is already increased to
1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.

Features negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new
features when needed in the future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40105 | vfs: Don&amp;#x27;t leak disconnected dentries on umount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfs: Don't leak disconnected dentries on umount

When user calls open_by_handle_at() on some inode that is not cached, we
will create disconnected dentry for it. If such dentry is a directory,
exportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the
dentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons
(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to
lookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we
are trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the
parent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the
parent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this
inconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point
to the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in
disconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until
commit f1ee616214cb ("VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon")
which removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb-&gt;s_anon list.
Thus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely
relies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.
However when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the
scenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries
are "leaked". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise
they stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous "Busy
inodes after unmount" bug. Make sure all dentries created under a
disconnected parent are marked as disconnected as well.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54469 | NeuVector Enforcer is vulnerable to Command Injection and Buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54469</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.


The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor
 process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks 
whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the 
monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.


The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT
 are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without 
validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user 
to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer
 container.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54471 | NeuVector is shipping cryptographic material into its binary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54471</link><description>NeuVector used a hard-coded cryptographic key embedded in the source

When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server.


In affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS

 to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept 
or modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the 
response of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size 
limitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS)

Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, an attacker can perform an online brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP, and passwords. While Zitadel allows preventing online brute force attacks in scenarios like TOTP, Email OTP, or passwords using a lockout mechanism. The mechanism is not enabled by default and can cause a denial of service for the corresponding user if enabled. Additionally, the mitigation strategies were not fully implemented in the more recent resource-based APIs.

If a user has set up MFA without this requirement, Zitadel would consider single factor auhtenticated sessions as valid as well and not require multiple factors. Bypassing second authentication factors weakens multifactor authentication and enables attackers to bypass the more secure factor. An attacker can target the TOTP code alone, only six digits, bypassing password verification entirely and potentially compromising accounts with 2FA enabled.

Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, a potential vulnerability exists in ZITADEL's password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. It's important to note that this specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:49:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11232 | Invalid characters cause assert</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11232</link><description>To trigger the issue, three configuration parameters must have specific settings: "hostname-char-set" must be left at the default setting, which is "[^A-Za-z0-9.-]"; "hostname-char-replacement" must be empty (the default); and "ddns-qualifying-suffix" must *NOT* be empty (the default is empty).

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue

To prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)
when cl-&gt;qdisc-&gt;ops-&gt;peek(cl-&gt;qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return
value before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.

To avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:

1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static
inline function.

2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to
include/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.

3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:48:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40084 | ksmbd: transport_ipc: validate payload size before reading handle</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40084</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This vulnerability stems from the way the StringLookup layer is handled during model loading from a specially crafted .keras archive. The constructor for the StringLookup layer accepts a vocabulary argument that can specify a local file path or a remote file path.

  *  Arbitrary Local File Read: An attacker can create a malicious .keras file that embeds a local path in the StringLookup layer's configuration. When the model is loaded, Keras will attempt to read the content of the specified local file and incorporate it into the model state (e.g., retrievable via get_vocabulary()), allowing an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the hosting system.


  *  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Keras utilizes tf.io.gfile for file operations. Since tf.io.gfile supports remote filesystem handlers (such as GCS and HDFS) and HTTP/HTTPS protocols, the same mechanism can be leveraged to fetch content from arbitrary network endpoints on the server's behalf, resulting in an SSRF condition.


The security issue is that the feature allowing external path loading was not properly restricted by the safe_mode=True flag, which was intended to prevent such unintended data access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 08:57:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58711 | WordPress Blog Designer PRO plugin &amp;lt;= 3.4.8 -

The weakness arises due to insufficient validation of user input in plugin endpoints, allowing crafted input to influence backend queries in unexpected ways. Using specially crafted payloads, this can escalate into unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary object injection in PHP. Although the issue is remotely exploitable without authentication, it does require a crafted interaction with the affected endpoint in order to trigger successfully.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:45:01 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
