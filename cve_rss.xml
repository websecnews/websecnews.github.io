In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql
variable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:38:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24573 | facileManager Privilege Escalation via Mass Assignment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24573</link><description>facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind.

When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:24:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23653 | BuildKit interactive containers API does not validate entitlements check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23653</link><description>BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:08:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23652 | BuildKit possible host system access from mount stub cleaner</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23652</link><description>BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner.

In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-47072 | SQL injection vulnerability in Enterprise Architect 16.0.1605 32-bit allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands via the Find parameter i...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-47072</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Enterprise Architect 16.0.1605 32-bit allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands via the Find parameter in the Select Classifier dialog box..</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:10:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1117 | openBI Screen.php index code injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1117</link><description>A vulnerability was found in openBI up to 1.0.8.

Label Studio's SSRF protections that can be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is because the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS lookup to verify that the IP address is not in an excluded subnet range. This protection can be bypassed by either using HTTP redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 16:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23502 | WordPress Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts Plugin &amp;lt;= 3.3.2 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23502</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in InfornWeb Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts: from n/a through 3.3.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:36:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23505 | WordPress PDF Viewer &amp;amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.38 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23505</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in DearHive PDF Viewer &amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF allows Stored XSS.This issue affects PDF Viewer &amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF: from n/a through 2.0.38.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23508 | WordPress PDF Poster - PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1.17 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23508</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in bPlugins PDF Poster – PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects PDF Poster – PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress: from n/a through 2.1.17.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0219 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik JustDecompile Installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0219</link><description>In Telerik JustDecompile versions prior to 2024 R1, a privilege elevation vulnerability has been identified in the applications installer component.  In an environment where an existing Telerik JustDecompile install is present, a lower privileged user has the ability to manipulate the installation package to elevate their privileges on the underlying operating system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0832 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik Reporting Installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0832</link><description>In Telerik Reporting versions prior to 2024 R1, a privilege elevation vulnerability has been identified in the applications installer component.  In an environment where an existing Telerik Reporting install is present, a lower privileged user has the ability to manipulate the installation package to elevate their privileges on the underlying operating system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0833 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik Test Studio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0833</link><description>In Telerik Test Studio versions prior to

The nft_setelem_catchall_deactivate() function checks whether the catch-all set element is active in the current generation instead of the next generation before freeing it, but only flags it inactive in the next generation, making it possible to free the element multiple times, leading to a double free vulnerability.

The nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double free vulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resembles NF_ACCEPT.

There is a bug in our implementation of PKCE that allows an attacker to circumvent the protection that PKCE offers. PKCE adds the code_challenge parameter to the authorization request and adds the code_verifier parameter to the token request. Prior to 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7, a downgrade scenario is possible: if the attacker removes the code_challenge parameter from the authorization request, authentik will not do the PKCE check. Because of this bug, an attacker can circumvent the protection PKCE offers, such as CSRF attacks and code injection attacks.  Versions 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:28:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1019 | WAF bypass of the ModSecurity v3 release line</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1019</link><description>ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs.

The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:21:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24324 | TOTOLINK A8000RU
