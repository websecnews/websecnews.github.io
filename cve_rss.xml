Affected by this vulnerability is the function amf_nsmf_pdusession_handle_update_sm_context of the file src/amf/nsmf-handler.c of the component AMF. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The attack can be launched remotely. This vulnerability allows a single UE to crash the AMF, resulting in the complete loss of mobility and session management services and causing a network-wide outage. All registered UEs will lose connectivity, and new registrations will be blocked until the AMF is restarted, leading to a high availability impact. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 13:22:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22224 | VMware ESXi, and Workstation contain a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use) vulnerability that leads to an out-of-bounds write. A malicious ac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22224</link><description>VMware ESXi, and Workstation contain a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use) vulnerability that leads to an out-of-bounds write. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 12:24:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22225 | VMware ESXi contains an arbitrary write vulnerability. A malicious actor with privileges within the VMX process may trigger an arbitrary ker...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22225</link><description>VMware ESXi contains an arbitrary write vulnerability. A malicious actor with privileges within the VMX process may trigger an arbitrary kernel write leading to an escape of the sandbox.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 12:24:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22226 | VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read in HGFS. A malicious actor...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22226</link><description>VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read in HGFS. A malicious actor with administrative privileges to a virtual machine may be able to exploit this issue to leak memory from the vmx process.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 12:24:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0370 | WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate &amp;lt;= 7.3.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via src Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0370</link><description>The WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘src’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

When reading data from a squash4 filesystem, grub's squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the direct_read() will perform a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:17:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1876 | D-Link DAP-1562 HTTP Header http_request_parse stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1876</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in D-Link DAP-1562 1.10.

ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix race at SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC

There is a small race window at snd_pcm_oss_sync() that is called from
OSS PCM SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl; namely the function calls
snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() at first, then takes the params_lock mutex
for the rest.  When the stream is set up again by another thread
between them, it leads to inconsistency, and may result in unexpected
results such as NULL dereference of OSS buffer as a fuzzer spotted
recently.

The fix is simply to cover snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() call into the same
params_lock mutex with snd_pcm_oss_make_ready_locked() variant.</description><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 14:38:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1816 | FFmpeg IAMF File iamf_parse.c audio_element_obu memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1816</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in FFmpeg up to 6e26f57f672b05e7b8b052007a83aef99dc81ccb.
