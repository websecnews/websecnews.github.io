This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2698 | Freeipa: delegation rules allow a proxy service to impersonate any user to access another target service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2698</link><description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:10:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3925 | Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp;amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) &amp;lt;= 5.6.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via onclick events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3925</link><description>The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Creative Button widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

This vulnerability allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) where arbitrary JavaScript can be executed in the top frame from an embedded iframe on any displayed web site within the in-app browser. The in-app browser is usually opened by tapping on URLs contained in chat messages, and for the attack to be successful, the victim must trigger a click event on a malicious iframe. If an iframe embedded in any website can be controlled by an attacker, this vulnerability could be exploited to capture or alter content displayed in the top frame, as well as user session information. This vulnerability affects LINE iOS versions below 14.9.0 and does not affect other LINE clients such as LINE Android. Please update LINE iOS to version 14.9.0 or higher.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 07:22:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28970 | Dell Client BIOS contains an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability.

Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4.

escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37293</link><description>The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:54:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34768 | WordPress Fastly plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.25 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34768</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Fastly.This issue affects Fastly: from n/a through 1.2.25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48273 | WordPress Preloader for Website plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.2 - Unauthenticated Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48273</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP OnlineSupport, Essential Plugin Preloader for Website.This issue affects Preloader for Website: from n/a through 1.2.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52227 | WordPress MailerLite – WooCommerce integration plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.8 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52227</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in MailerLite MailerLite – WooCommerce integration.This issue affects MailerLite – WooCommerce integration: from n/a through 2.0.8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34799 | WordPress BookingPress plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.82 - Appointment Duration Manipulation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34799</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Repute Infosystems BookingPress.This issue affects BookingPress: from n/a through 1.0.82.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:44:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52224 | WordPress Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;= 4.9.7 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52224</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Revolut Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce.This issue affects Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce: from n/a through 4.9.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:33:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26330 | An issue was discovered in Kape CyberGhostVPN 8.4.3.12823 on Windows.

In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35665 | WordPress Insert Post Ads plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.2 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35665</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in namithjawahar Insert Post Ads.This issue affects Insert Post Ads: from n/a through 1.3.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35667 | WordPress Shopping Cart &amp;amp; eCommerce Store plugin &amp;lt;= 5.5.19 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35667</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP EasyCart.This issue affects WP EasyCart: from n/a through 5.5.19.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37161 | MeterSphere front-end editor stores XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37161</link><description>MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform.

It is possible to introduce user-controlled JavaScript code and trigger a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some cases. Version 2.0.0 introduces changes to mitigate this issue. Version 2.0.0 contains updated documentation to clarify that while ghtml escapes characters with special meaning in HTML, it does not provide comprehensive protection against all types of XSS attacks in every scenario. This aligns with the approach taken by other template engines. Developers should be cautious and take additional measures to sanitize user input and prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the backtick character (`) is now also escaped to prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a malicious actor somehow gains the ability to write JavaScript. This does not provide comprehensive protection either.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 21:39:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32849 | Trend Micro Security 17.x (Consumer) is vulnerable to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to unintentiona...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32849</link><description>Trend Micro Security 17.x (Consumer) is vulnerable to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to unintentionally delete privileged Trend Micro files including its own.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 21:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35241 | Composer vulnerable to command injection via malicious git branch name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35241</link><description>Composer is a dependency manager for PHP.

af_unix: Update unix_sk(sk)-&gt;oob_skb under sk_receive_queue lock.

Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong reported a race between __unix_gc() and
queue_oob().

__unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect close()d inflight sockets,
and then if the socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)-&gt;oob_skb, GC
will drop the reference and set NULL to it locklessly.

However, the peer socket still can send MSG_OOB message and
queue_oob() can update unix_sk(sk)-&gt;oob_skb concurrently, leading
NULL pointer dereference. [0]

To fix the issue, let's update unix_sk(sk)-&gt;oob_skb under the
sk_receive_queue's lock and take it everywhere we touch oob_skb.

Note that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob() to silence lockdep
false-positive (See [1]).

A control-flow timing lean has been identified in the reference implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`, `-O1`, and other compilation options. A proof-of-concept local attack on the reference implementation leaks the entire ML-KEM 512 secret key in ~10 minutes using end-to-end decapsulation timing measurements. The issue has been fixed in version 0.10.1. As a possible workaround, some compiler options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information, however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be reliable.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 12:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5785 | Command injection vulnerability in Comtrend router</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5785</link><description>Command injection vulnerability in Comtrend router WLD71-T1_v2.0.201820, affecting the GRG-4280us version.

net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race

__dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when
sk-&gt;dst_cache must be cleared, leading to possible UAF.

RCU rules are that we must first clear sk-&gt;sk_dst_cache,
then call dst_release(old_dst).

Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly,
while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.

Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic
against RTF_CACHE, this means each of the three -&gt;negative_advice()
existing methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.

Note the check against NULL dst is centralized in
__dst_negative_advice(), there is no need to duplicate
it in various callbacks.

Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.

This old bug became visible after the blamed commit, using UDP sockets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 09:12:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21751 | WordPress RabbitLoader plugin &amp;lt;= 2.19.13 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21751</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in RabbitLoader.This issue affects RabbitLoader: from n/a through 2.19.13.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22296 | WordPress 12 Step Meeting List plugin &amp;lt;= 3.14.28 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22296</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Code for Recovery 12 Step Meeting List.This issue affects 12 Step Meeting List: from n/a through 3.14.28.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 08:32:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22298 | WordPress Amelia plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.98 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22298</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in TMS Amelia ameliabooking.This issue affects Amelia: from n/a through 1.0.98.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 08:32:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23524 | WordPress PilotPress plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.30 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23524</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in ONTRAPORT Inc.
