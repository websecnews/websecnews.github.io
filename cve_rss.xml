Based on the code analysis, it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses significant security risks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:51:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54879 | SeaCMS V13.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control.

btrfs: check folio mapping after unlock in relocate_one_folio()

When we call btrfs_read_folio() to bring a folio uptodate, we unlock the
folio. The result of that is that a different thread can modify the
mapping (like remove it with invalidate) before we call folio_lock().
This results in an invalid page and we need to try again.

In particular, if we are relocating concurrently with aborting a
transaction, this can result in a crash like the following:

This occurs because cleanup_one_transaction() calls
destroy_delalloc_inodes() which calls invalidate_inode_pages2() which
takes the folio_lock before setting mapping to NULL. We fail to check
this, and subsequently call set_extent_mapping(), which assumes that
mapping != NULL (in fact it asserts that in debug mode)

Note that the "fixes" patch here is not the one that introduced the
race (the very first iteration of this code from 2009) but a more recent
change that made this particular crash happen in practice.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:39:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56759 | btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:39:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56760 | PCI/MSI: Handle lack of irqdomain gracefully</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56760</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/MSI: Handle lack of irqdomain gracefully

Alexandre observed a warning emitted from pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() on a
RISCV platform which does not provide PCI/MSI support:

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at drivers/pci/msi/msi.h:121 pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32
 __pci_enable_msix_range+0x30c/0x596
 pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32
 pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity+0xb8/0xe2

RISCV uses hierarchical interrupt domains and correctly does not implement
the legacy fallback. The warning triggers from the legacy fallback stub.

That warning is bogus as the PCI/MSI layer knows whether a PCI/MSI parent
domain is associated with the device or not. There is a check for MSI-X,
which has a legacy assumption. But that legacy fallback assumption is only
valid when legacy support is enabled, but otherwise the check should simply
return -ENOTSUPP.

Loongarch tripped over the same problem and blindly enabled legacy support
without implementing the legacy fallbacks. There are weak implementations
which return an error, so the problem was papered over.

Correct pci_msi_domain_supports() to evaluate the legacy mode and add
the missing supported check into the MSI enable path to complete it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:39:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56761 | x86/fred: Clear WFE in missing-ENDBRANCH #CPs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56761</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fred: Clear WFE in missing-ENDBRANCH #CPs

An indirect branch instruction sets the CPU indirect branch tracker
(IBT) into WAIT_FOR_ENDBRANCH (WFE) state and WFE stays asserted
across the instruction boundary.  When the decoder finds an
inappropriate instruction while WFE is set ENDBR, the CPU raises a #CP
fault.

For the "kernel IBT no ENDBR" selftest where #CPs are deliberately
triggered, the WFE state of the interrupted context needs to be
cleared to let execution continue.  Otherwise when the CPU resumes
from the instruction that just caused the previous #CP, another
missing-ENDBRANCH #CP is raised and the CPU enters a dead loop.

This is not a problem with IDT because it doesn't preserve WFE and
IRET doesn't set WFE.  But FRED provides space on the entry stack
(in an expanded CS area) to save and restore the WFE state, thus the
WFE state is no longer clobbered, so software must clear it.

Clear WFE to avoid dead looping in ibt_clear_fred_wfe() and the
!ibt_fatal code path when execution is allowed to continue.

Clobbering WFE in any other circumstance is a security-relevant bug.

happens if io_uring_alloc_task_context() fails and then io_sq_thread()

If add_disk() fails, the gendisk may have been freed when calling

media: dvb-frontends: dib3000mb: fix uninit-value in dib3000_write_reg

Syzbot reports [1] an uninitialized value issue found by KMSAN in
dib3000_read_reg().

Local u8 rb[2] is used in i2c_transfer() as a read buffer; in case
that call fails, the buffer may end up with some undefined values.

Since no elaborate error handling is expected in dib3000_write_reg(),
simply zero out rb buffer to mitigate the problem.
