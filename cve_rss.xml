Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29186 | Slow String Operations via MultiPart Requests in Event-Driven Functions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29186</link><description>Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime &lt;= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total maximum size of ~10KB.

Version 2.1.17 contains a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29184 | FreeScout Stored XSS to Privilege Escalation After CSP Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29184</link><description>FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to defacement of the Application.

Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29385 | DIR-845L router &lt;= v1.01KRb03 has an Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the cgibin binary via soapcgi_main function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29385</link><description>DIR-845L router &lt;= v1.01KRb03 has an Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the cgibin binary via soapcgi_main function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2822 | DedeCMS vote_edit.php cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2822</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in DedeCMS 5.7.

This affects, for example, Saflok MT, and the Confidant, Quantum, RT, and Saffire series.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 17:10:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29180 | webpack-dev-middleware Path Traversal vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29180</link><description>Prior to versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.

Developers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:57:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2578 | WordPress WP Coder plugin &amp;lt;= 3.5 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2578</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WPCoder WP Coder allows Stored XSS.This issue affects WP Coder: from n/a through 3.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:57:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2579 | WordPress Tracking Code Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.16 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2579</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Data443 Tracking Code Manager.This issue affects Tracking Code Manager: from n/a through 2.0.16.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:57:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2580 | WordPress Recover WooCommerce Cart Abandonment, Newsletter, Email Marketing, Marketing Automation By FunnelKit plugin &amp;lt;= 2.8.2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2580</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in FunnelKit Automation By Autonami allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Automation By Autonami: from n/a through 2.8.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:57:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27962 | WordPress wp-mpdf plugin &amp;lt;= 3.7.1 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27962</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Florian 'fkrauthan' Krauthan allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects wp-mpdf: from n/a through 3.7.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:50:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27963 | WordPress Crisp – Live Chat and Chatbot plugin &amp;lt;= 0.44 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27963</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Crisp allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Crisp: from n/a through 0.44.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:50:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27964 | WordPress Zippy plugin &amp;lt;= 1.6.9 - Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27964</link><description>Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in Gesundheit Bewegt GmbH Zippy.This issue affects Zippy: from n/a through 1.6.9.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:50:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27965 | WordPress WPFunnels plugin &amp;lt;= 3.0.6 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27965</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WPFunnels Team WPFunnels allows Stored XSS.This issue affects WPFunnels: from n/a through 3.0.6.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29019 | ESPHome vulnerable to Authentication bypass via Cross site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29019</link><description>ESPHome is a system to control microcontrollers remotely through Home Automation systems. API endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out attacks against a logged user of the dashboard to perform operations on configuration files (create, edit, delete). It is possible for a malicious actor to create a specifically crafted web page that triggers a cross site request against ESPHome, this allows bypassing the authentication for API calls on the platform. This vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on API calls accessing configuration file operations on the behalf of a logged user. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the victim must visit a weaponized page. In addition to this, it is possible to chain this vulnerability with GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5/ CVE-2024-27287 to obtain a complete takeover of the user account.

netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout

While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it to
collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is being
released from the commit path.

Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x
with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since
7395dfacfff6 ("netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set
element timeout").

Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc
in this case.

According to 08e4c8c5919f ("netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on
transaction abort"), Florian plans to accelerate abort path by releasing
objects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort
path too.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 10:48:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29732 | SQL Injection vulnerability on SCAN_VISIO eDocument Suite Web Viewer from Abast</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29732</link><description>A SQL Injection has been found on SCAN_VISIO eDocument Suite Web Viewer of Abast.

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22724 | An issue was discovered in osCommerce v4, allows local attackers to bypass file upload restrictions and execute arbitrary code via administr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22724</link><description>An issue was discovered in osCommerce v4, allows local attackers to bypass file upload restrictions and execute arbitrary code via administrator profile photo upload feature.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29862 | The Kerlink firewall in ChirpStack chirpstack-mqtt-forwarder before 4.2.1 and chirpstack-gateway-bridge before 4.0.11 wrongly accepts certai...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29862</link><description>The Kerlink firewall in ChirpStack chirpstack-mqtt-forwarder before 4.2.1 and chirpstack-gateway-bridge before 4.0.11 wrongly accepts certain TCP packets when a connection is not in the ESTABLISHED state.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48901 | A SQL injection vulnerability in tramyardg Autoexpress version 1.3.0, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL comma...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48901</link><description>A SQL injection vulnerability in tramyardg Autoexpress version 1.3.0, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the parameter "id" within the getPhotosByCarId function call in details.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48902 | An issue was discovered in tramyardg autoexpress version 1.3.0, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to escalate privileges, update car d...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48902</link><description>An issue was discovered in tramyardg autoexpress version 1.3.0, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to escalate privileges, update car data, delete vehicles, and upload car images via authentication bypass in uploadCarImages.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48903 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in tramyardg autoexpress 1.3.0, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48903</link><description>Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in tramyardg autoexpress 1.3.0, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML within parameter "imgType" via in uploadCarImages.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29858 | In MISP before 2.4.187, __uploadLogo in app/Controller/OrganisationsController.php does not properly check for a valid logo upload.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29858</link><description>In MISP before 2.4.187, __uploadLogo in app/Controller/OrganisationsController.php does not properly check for a valid logo upload.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:26:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29859 | In MISP before 2.4.187, add_misp_export in app/Controller/EventsController.php does not properly check for a valid file upload.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29859</link><description>In MISP before 2.4.187, add_misp_export in app/Controller/EventsController.php does not properly check for a valid file upload.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:26:05 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
