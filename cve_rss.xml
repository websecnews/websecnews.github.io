Prior to versions 16.6.7 and 17.0.3, an arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in OpenProject’s repository changes endpoint (/projects/:project_id/repository/changes) when rendering the “latest changes” view via git log. By supplying a specially crafted rev value (for example, rev=--output=/tmp/poc.txt), an attacker can inject git log command-line options. When OpenProject executes the SCM command, Git interprets the attacker-controlled rev as an option and writes the output to an attacker-chosen path. As a result, any user with the :browse_repository permission on the project can create or overwrite arbitrary files that the OpenProject process user is permitted to write. The written contents consist of git log output, but by crafting custom commits the attacker can still upload valid shell scripts, ultimately leading to RCE. The RCE lets the attacker create a reverse shell to the target host and view confidential files outside of OpenProject, such as /etc/passwd.

From 1.34.0 to before 1.51.0,  a path traversal vulnerability in the Pydantic AI web UI allows an attacker to serve arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application by crafting a malicious URL. In affected versions, the CDN URL is constructed using a version query parameter from the request URL. This parameter is not validated, allowing path traversal sequences that cause the server to fetch and serve attacker-controlled HTML/JavaScript from an arbitrary source on the same CDN, instead of the legitimate chat UI package. If a victim clicks the link or visits it via an iframe, attacker-controlled code executes in their browser, enabling theft of chat history and other client-side data. This vulnerability only affects applications that use Agent.to_web to serve a chat interface and clai web to serve a chat interface from the CLI.

Prior to versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2, the asterisk/contrib/scripts/ast_coredumper runs as root, as noted by the NOTES tag on line 689 of the ast_coredumper file. The script will source the contents of /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf, which resides in a folder that is writeable by the asterisk user:group. Due to the /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf file following bash semantics and it being loaded; an attacker with write permissions may add or modify the file such that when the root ast_coredumper is run; it would source and thereby execute arbitrary bash code found in the /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf. This issue has been patched in versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 17:09:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2058 | mathurvishal CloudClassroom-PHP-Project Post Query Details postquerypublic.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2058</link><description>A flaw has been found in mathurvishal CloudClassroom-PHP-Project up to 5dadec098bfbbf3300d60c3494db3fb95b66e7be.

The function accepts a caller-owned fz_pixmap pointer but incorrectly drops the pixmap in its error handling path before rethrowing the exception. Callers (including the barcode decoding path in fz_decode_barcode_from_display_list) also drop the same pixmap in cleanup, resulting in a double-free that can corrupt the heap and crash the process. This issue affects applications that enable and use MuPDF barcode decoding and can be triggered by processing crafted input that causes a rendering-time error while decoding barcodes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:23:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13523 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Display Names in Mattermost Confluence Plugin OAuth2 Flow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13523</link><description>Mattermost Confluence plugin version &lt;1.7.0 fails to properly escape user-controlled display names in HTML template rendering which allows authenticated Confluence users with malicious display names to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers via sending a specially crafted OAuth2 connection link that, when visited, renders the attacker's display name without proper sanitization.

Prior to Collabora Online Development Edition version 25.04.08.2 and prior to Collabora Online versions 23.05.20.1, 24.04.17.3, and 25.04.7.5, a user with view-only rights and no download privileges can obtain a local copy of a shared file.

From version 5.49.0 to before 5.104.0, when experiments.buildHttp is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver (HttpUriPlugin) enforces allowedUris only for the initial URL, but does not re-validate allowedUris after following HTTP 30x redirects. As a result, an import that appears restricted to a trusted allow-list can be redirected to HTTP(S) URLs outside the allow-list. This is a policy/allow-list bypass that enables build-time SSRF behavior (requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and untrusted content inclusion in build outputs (redirected content is treated as module source and bundled). This issue has been patched in version 5.104.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 23:34:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68458 | webpack buildHttp: allowedUris allow-list bypass via URL userinfo (@) leading to build-time SSRF behavior</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68458</link><description>Webpack is a module bundler. From version 5.49.0 to before 5.104.1, when experiments.buildHttp is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver (HttpUriPlugin) can be bypassed to fetch resources from hosts outside allowedUris by using crafted URLs that include userinfo (username:password@host). If allowedUris enforcement relies on a raw string prefix check (e.g., uri.startsWith(allowed)), a URL that looks allow-listed can pass validation while the actual network request is sent to a different authority/host after URL parsing. This is a policy/allow-list bypass that enables build-time SSRF behavior (outbound requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and untrusted content inclusion (the fetched response is treated as module source and bundled).

Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.32, there is a DoS vulnerability in ReadRSSFeedBlock. In RSSBlock, feedparser.parser is called to obtain the XML file according to the URL input by the user, parse the XML, and finally obtain the parsed result. However, during the parsing process, there is no limit on the parsing time and the resources that can be allocated for parsing. When a malicious user lets RSSBlock parse a carefully constructed, deep XML, it will cause memory resources to be exhausted, eventually causing DoS.

Exploitation requires invasive physical access, including opening the device and attaching external equipment to the SPI bus to capture TPM communications.

An attacker with physical access to the device could use this information to access the bootloader menu via a serial interface.  Access to the bootloader menu does not allow full system takeover or privilege escalation. The bootloader enforces digital signature verification and only permits flashing of Moxa-signed images. As a result, an attacker cannot install malicious firmware or execute arbitrary code. The primary impact is limited to a potential temporary denial-of-service condition if a valid image is reflashed. Remote exploitation is not possible.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:30:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69619 | A path traversal in My Text Editor v1.6.2 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via writing files to the internal storage.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69619</link><description>A path traversal in My Text Editor v1.6.2 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via writing files to the internal storage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:30:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-37117 | jizhiCMS 1.6.7 - Arbitrary File Download</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-37117</link><description>jizhiCMS 1.6.7 contains a file download vulnerability in the admin plugins update endpoint that allows authenticated administrators to download arbitrary files.
