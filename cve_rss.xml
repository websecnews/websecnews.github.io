For example, when {name} is used in an email template, it will be replaced with the buyer's name for the final email. If the name of the attendee contained HTML or Markdown formatting, this was rendered as HTML in the resulting email. This way, a user could inject links or other formatted text through a maliciously formatted name. Since pretix applies a strict allow list approach to allowed HTML tags, this could not be abused for XSS or similarly dangerous attack chains. However, it can be used to manipulate emails in a way that makes user-provided content appear in a trustworthy and credible way, which can be abused for phishing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:10:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10476 | WP Fastest Cache &amp;lt;= 1.4.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) DB Cleanup Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10476</link><description>The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_db_fix_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0.

Prior to version 2.52.0, developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the User-Agent header starting with the string "Mozilla" as a defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the User-Agent header to be modified. Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement (malvertising).

Prior to versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1, there is a XSRF token leakage via protocol-relative URLs in angular HTTP clients. The vulnerability is a Credential Leak by App Logic that leads to the unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token to an attacker-controlled domain. Angular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol (http:// or https://) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (//), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the X-XSRF-TOKEN header. This issue has been patched in versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1. A workaround for this issue involves avoiding using protocol-relative URLs (URLs starting with //) in HttpClient requests. All backend communication URLs should be hardcoded as relative paths (starting with a single /) or fully qualified, trusted absolute URLs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65202 | TRENDnet TEW-657BRM 1.00.1 has an authenticated remote OS command injection vulnerability in the setup.cgi binary, exploitable via the HTTP ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65202</link><description>TRENDnet TEW-657BRM 1.00.1 has an authenticated remote OS command injection vulnerability in the setup.cgi binary, exploitable via the HTTP parameters "command", "todo", and "next_file," which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12571 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12571</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 17.10 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that could have allowed an unauthenticated user to cause a Denial of Service condition by sending specifically crafted requests containing malicious JSON payloads.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12653 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12653</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 18.3 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that under specific conditions could have allowed an unauthenticated user to join arbitrary organizations by changing headers on some requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13611 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13611</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 13.2 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that could have allowed an authenticated user with access to certain logs to obtain sensitive tokens under specific conditions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50433 | An issue was discovered in imonnit.com (2025-04-24) allowing malicious actors to gain escalated privileges via crafted password reset to tak...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50433</link><description>An issue was discovered in imonnit.com (2025-04-24) allowing malicious actors to gain escalated privileges via crafted password reset to take over arbitrary user accounts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65670 | An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in classroomio 0.1.13 allows students to access sensitive admin/teacher endpoints by manipulating...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65670</link><description>An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in classroomio 0.1.13 allows students to access sensitive admin/teacher endpoints by manipulating course IDs in URLs, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive course, admin, and student data.

In this case, the secret is generated using `ThreadLocalRandom`,
 which is not a crypto-graphically secure random number generator. This 
may allow an attacker to predict or brute force the secret used to sign 
authentication cookies, potentially enabling token forgery or 
authentication bypass. Additionally, each process generates its own 
fallback secret, resulting in inconsistent secrets across nodes. This 
causes authentication failures in distributed or multi-broker 
deployments, effectively leading to a incorrectly configured clusters. Users are 
advised to configure a strong `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret`



This issue affects Apache Druid: through 34.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 35.0.0, which fixes the issue making it mandatory to set `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` when using the Kerberos authenticator.

The vulnerability is only exploitable by trusted/authorized users/applications that are allowed to call directly the Thrift APIs. In most real-world deployments, HMS is accessible to only a handful of applications (e.g., Hiveserver2) thus the vulnerability is not exploitable. Moreover, the vulnerable code cannot be reached when metastore.try.direct.sql property is set to false.

This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.1.0 before 4.2.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.2.0, which fixes the issue. Users who cannot upgrade directly are encouraged to set metastore.try.direct.sql property to false if the HMS Thrift APIs are exposed to general public.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 08:59:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13735 | Out-of-bounds Read in nr flc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13735</link><description>Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in ASR1903、ASR3901 in ASR Lapwing_Linux on Linux (nr_fw modules).

Prior to version 2.4.4, an out-of-bounds array access issue exists in WAMR's fast interpreter mode during WASM bytecode loading. When frame_ref_bottom and frame_offset_bottom arrays are at capacity and a GET_GLOBAL(I32) opcode is encountered, frame_ref_bottom is expanded but frame_offset_bottom may not be. If this is immediately followed by an if opcode that triggers preserve_local_for_block, the function traverses arrays using stack_cell_num as the upper bound, causing out-of-bounds access to frame_offset_bottom since it wasn't expanded to match the increased stack_cell_num.

In version 0.9.2 and prior, there is a remote code execution vulnerability by pickle deserialization via FlaskRPCServer. The Fugue framework implements an RPC server system for distributed computing operations. In the core functionality of the RPC server implementation, I found that the _decode() function in fugue/rpc/flask.py directly uses cloudpickle.loads() to deserialize data without any sanitization. This creates a remote code execution vulnerability when malicious pickle data is processed by the RPC server. The vulnerability exists in the RPC communication mechanism where the client can send arbitrary serialized Python objects that will be deserialized on the server side, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This issue has been patched via commit 6f25326.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:34:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63735 | A reflected Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Ruckus Unleashed 200.13.6.1.319 via the name parameter to the the captive-portal end...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-63735</link><description>A reflected Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Ruckus Unleashed 200.13.6.1.319 via the name parameter to the the captive-portal endpoint selfguestpass/guestAccessSubmit.jsp.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:34:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51741 | An issue was discovered in Veal98 Echo Open-Source Community System 2.2 thru 2.3 allowing an unauthenticated attacker to cause the server to...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51741</link><description>An issue was discovered in Veal98 Echo Open-Source Community System 2.2 thru 2.3 allowing an unauthenticated attacker to cause the server to send email verification messages to arbitrary users via the /sendEmailCodeForResetPwd endpoint potentially causing a denial of service to the server or the downstream users.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:20:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51743 | An issue was discovered in jishenghua JSH_ERP 2.3.1.

The Doc Flow module uses the 'arc' handler to retrieve and render pages or resources specified by the user-supplied 'pp' parameter, but it does so without enforcing authentication or restricting path inputs. As a result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can supply local filesystem paths to read arbitrary files accessible to the service account. On Windows deployments, providing a UNC path can also coerce the server into initiating outbound SMB authentication, potentially exposing NTLM credentials for offline cracking or relay. This issue may lead to sensitive information disclosure and, in some environments, enable further lateral movement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:25:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65961 | Contao is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in templates</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65961</link><description>Contao is an Open Source CMS.

The endpoint fails to implement any authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to perform POST requests to register new user accounts in the application's local database. This bypasses the intended security architecture, which relies on an external Identity Provider for initial user registration and assumes that internal user creation is an administrative-only function. This vector can also be chained with other vulnerabilities for privilege escalation and complete compromise of application. This specific request can be used to also enumerate already registered user accounts, aiding in social engineering or further targeted attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:58:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65084 | Out-of-bounds Write in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, Cobalt Share</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65084</link><description>An Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability is present in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share versions 12.6.1204.207 and prior that could allow an attacker to disclose information or execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65085 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, Cobalt Share</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65085</link><description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability is present in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share versions 12.6.1204.207 and prior that could allow an attacker to disclose information or execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13483 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function in SiRcom SMART Alert (SiSA)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13483</link><description>SiRcom SMART Alert (SiSA) allows unauthorized access to backend APIs.
