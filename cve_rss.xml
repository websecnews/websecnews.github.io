Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:50:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32956 | ManageWiki has SQL injection vulnerability in NamespaceMigrationJob</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32956</link><description>ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Versions before commit f504ed8, are vulnerable to SQL injection when renaming a namespace in Special:ManageWiki/namespaces when using a page prefix (namespace name, which is the current namespace you are renaming) with an injection payload. This issue has been patched in commit f504ed8. A workaround for this vulnerability involves setting `$wgManageWiki['namespaces'] = false;`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:50:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32958 | Adept exposed the GITHUB_TOKEN in workflow run artifact</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32958</link><description>Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:50:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3842 | panhainan DS-Java FileUpload.java uploadUserPic.action code injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3842</link><description>A vulnerability was found in panhainan DS-Java 1.0 and classified as critical.

In versions prior to 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a /../ in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:44:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32793 | Cilium packets from terminating endpoints may not be encrypted in Wireguard-enabled clusters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32793</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

This issue has been patched in versions 1.15.16, 1.16.9, and 1.17.3. There are no workarounds available for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:44:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12543 | A user enumeration and subsequent data integrity vulnerability affecting barcode functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12543</link><description>User Enumeration and Data Integrity in Barcode functionality in OpenText Content Management versions 24.3-25.1on Windows and Linux allows a malicous authenticated attacker to potentially alter barcode attributes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:33:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28367 | mojoPortal &lt;=2.9.0.1 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal via BetterImageGallery API Controller - ImageHandler Action.

This vulnerability exists due to insufficient access controls on an API endpoint, enabling any authenticated user to specify and delete files outside their intended scope. Exploiting this flaw could lead to data loss, denial of service (DoS), and potential escalation of impact depending on the deleted files.
