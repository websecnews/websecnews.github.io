In version 1.38 and prior, the `makefile-ubuntu.yml` workflow file uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the `z80pack-ubuntu` artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated `.git/config` file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. This issue has been fixed in commit bd95916.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:50:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53591 | An issue in the login page of Seclore v3.27.5.0 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a brute force attack.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53591</link><description>An issue in the login page of Seclore v3.27.5.0 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a brute force attack.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:33:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29058 | An issue in Qimou CMS v.3.34.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the upgrade.php component.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29058</link><description>An issue in Qimou CMS v.3.34.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the upgrade.php component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:33:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25983 | An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380 Pro android application 2.1.44 and V380 Pro android application 2.1.64 allows an attacker ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25983</link><description>An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380 Pro android application 2.1.44 and V380 Pro android application 2.1.64 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via the QE code based sharing component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:19:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25984 | An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380E6_C1 IP camera (Hw_HsAKPIQp_WF_XHR) 1020302 allows a physically proximate attacker to exec...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25984</link><description>An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380E6_C1 IP camera (Hw_HsAKPIQp_WF_XHR) 1020302 allows a physically proximate attacker to execute arbitrary code via UART component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:19:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25985 | An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380E6_C1 IP camera (Hw_HsAKPIQp_WF_XHR) 1020302 allows a physically proximate attacker to exec...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25985</link><description>An issue in Macro-video Technologies Co.,Ltd V380E6_C1 IP camera (Hw_HsAKPIQp_WF_XHR) 1020302 allows a physically proximate attacker to execute arbitrary code via the /mnt/mtd/mvconf/wifi.ini and /mnt/mtd/mvconf/user_info.ini components.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:19:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32377 | Rasa Pro Missing Authentication For Voice Connector APIs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32377</link><description>Rasa Pro is a framework for building scalable, dynamic conversational AI assistants that integrate large language models (LLMs).

This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized changes, which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the API access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can send enable or disable requests for apps.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:16:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31120 | NamelessMC Vulnerable to Cookie-Based View Count Manipulation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31120</link><description>NamelessMC is a free, easy to use &amp; powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client before 2.1.1 when performing connections to untrusted servers. Such servers could abuse the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be bypassed.

The .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization. The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method for the future.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:32:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29209 | TOTOLINK X18 v9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329 has an unauthorized arbitrary command execution in the enable parameter' of the sub_41105C function of ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29209</link><description>TOTOLINK X18 v9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329 has an unauthorized arbitrary command execution in the enable parameter' of the sub_41105C function of cstecgi .cgi.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:16:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3792 | SeaCMS admin_link.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3792</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in SeaCMS up to 13.3.

HSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &amp;amp;ssi-&gt;work is bound with
ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function
within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the
work.

If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()
to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence
of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                    CPU1

                        | ssip_xmit_work
ssi_protocol_remove     |
kfree(ssi);             |
                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi-&gt;cl;
                        | // use ssi

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding
with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:34:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29643 | An issue in croogo v.3.0.2 allows an attacker to perform Host header injection via the feed.rss component.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29643</link><description>An issue in croogo v.3.0.2 allows an attacker to perform Host header injection via the feed.rss component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29625 | A buffer overflow vulnerability in Astrolog v7.70 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via an overl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29625</link><description>A buffer overflow vulnerability in Astrolog v7.70 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via an overly long environment variable passed to FileOpen function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40364 | io_uring: fix io_req_prep_async with provided buffers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40364</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir

Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir
entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later
on, when the corrupted directory is removed).

ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'
and '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads
the '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()
and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir
entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the
same data block.

If the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the
sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data
block) and leaves "struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de" point exactly past the
memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to
ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer
which results in out-of-bounds mem access.

Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir
entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony
dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).

Note: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another
structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is
really an OOB read.

This issue was found by syzkaller tool.

LoongArch: BPF: Fix off-by-one error in build_prologue()

Vincent reported that running BPF progs with tailcalls on LoongArch
causes kernel hard lockup. Debugging the issues shows that the JITed
image missing a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.

There are two passes in JIT compiling, the first pass set the flags and
the second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With BPF progs
mixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls, build_prologue() generates N insns in the
first pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes
epilogue_offset off by one and we will jump to some unexpected insn and
cause lockup. Fix this by inserting a nop insn.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37925 | jfs: reject on-disk inodes of an unsupported type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37925</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors

Commit

  6eac36bb9eb0 ("x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid")

added logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirty
cache lines when creating a new control group, if requested by the arch code.
This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is
applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the
monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused
monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.

This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This
causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the
array was not allocated by dom_data_init().

As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy
monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is
allocated.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38104 | drm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38104</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV

RLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU
registers in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and
register reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same
registers simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the
RLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This
means that only one thread can access the registers at a time,
preventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed
correctly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a
high-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to
acquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in
amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.

The call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being
called, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked
from amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from
gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.

The [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to
acquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep
(like holding a spinlock).

Fixes the below:

remoteproc: core: Clear table_sz when rproc_shutdown

There is case as below could trigger kernel dump:
Use U-Boot to start remote processor(rproc) with resource table
published to a fixed address by rproc. After Kernel boots up,
stop the rproc, load a new firmware which doesn't have resource table
,and start rproc.

When starting rproc with a firmware not have resource table,
`memcpy(loaded_table, rproc-&gt;cached_table, rproc-&gt;table_sz)` will
trigger dump, because rproc-&gt;cache_table is set to NULL during the last
stop operation, but rproc-&gt;table_sz is still valid.

This issue is found on i.MX8MP and i.MX9.

net_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertions

In the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertion
that fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc under
TBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at
packets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are
unavailable.

This peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc
queue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,
SKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its
internal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.

The fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not
necessary at all.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39688 | nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39688</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()

The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a
delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the
deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets
bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.

When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with
SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked
with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for
s FREE_STATEID call.

nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status
flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the "size_check" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
"ea_get: invalid extended attribute" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
"size" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The "size" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called "len" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
"int remaining", which is then assigned to "int linelen" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i &lt; len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the "ptr+i" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of "ptr", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j &lt; len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen &lt; lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

To fix this we should validate "EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr)"
before it is utilised.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39755 | staging: gpib: Fix cb7210 pcmcia Oops</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39755</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context

Patch series "mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling",
v4.

## 1. What am I trying to do:

This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure
handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as
compared to 5.10 LTS.

    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space
    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space

## 2. What is the expected outcome and why

- For copyin case:

Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or
copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return
-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler
checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be
recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code
specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.

- For instr case:

If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery
is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills
by reading from storage.


## 3. What actually happens and why

- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17

Commit 4c132d1d844a ("x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage") introduced a new
extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the
extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from
EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS
handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().

- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI
  and #MCE race

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA
signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when
the data is about to be consumed.

### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]

Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that
detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a
broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action
Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because
it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that
bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE
interrupts and finally become an IERR.

Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub
from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to
#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in
uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*
signature name.

### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in
    Intel platform [1]

Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,
the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is
executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference
between a "real" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if
an error is found in any read.

Thus:

1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a
   speculative read.

2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read
   request

3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the
   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.

Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory
controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction
reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page
(marking it as poison).


## Why user process is killed for instr case

can: dev: can_get_echo_skb(): prevent call to kfree_skb() in hard IRQ context

If a driver calls can_get_echo_skb() during a hardware IRQ (which is often, but
not always, the case), the 'WARN_ON(in_irq)' in
net/core/skbuff.c#skb_release_head_state() might be triggered, under network
congestion circumstances, together with the potential risk of a NULL pointer
dereference.

The root cause of this issue is the call to kfree_skb() instead of
dev_kfree_skb_irq() in net/core/dev.c#enqueue_to_backlog().

This patch prevents the skb to be freed within the call to netif_rx() by
incrementing its reference count with skb_get(). The skb is finally freed by
one of the in-irq-context safe functions: dev_consume_skb_any() or
dev_kfree_skb_any(). The "any" version is used because some drivers might call
can_get_echo_skb() in a normal context.

The reason for this issue to occur is that initially, in the core network
stack, loopback skb were not supposed to be received in hardware IRQ context.
The CAN stack is an exeption.

This bug was previously reported back in 2017 in [1] but the proposed patch
never got accepted.

While [1] directly modifies net/core/dev.c, we try to propose here a
smoother modification local to CAN network stack (the assumption
behind is that only CAN devices are affected by this issue).

can: dev: can_restart: fix use after free bug

After calling netif_rx_ni(skb), dereferencing skb is unsafe.
Especially, the can_frame cf which aliases skb memory is accessed
after the netif_rx_ni() in:
      stats-&gt;rx_bytes += cf-&gt;len;

Reordering the lines solves the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:15:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47669 | can: vxcan: vxcan_xmit: fix use after free bug</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47669</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path

In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can-&gt;do_set_mode() fails, the function
directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the
skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other
terms, this is a memory leak.

This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and
let the function continue.

Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for

The affected product does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for deserialization. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the application to allocate exhaustive amounts of memory and subsequently create a partial denial of service condition.
Successful exploitation is only possible in redundant Telecontrol Server Basic setups and only if the connection between the redundant servers has been disrupted.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:11:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1532 | Code Injection Vulnerability in Phoneservice</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1532</link><description>Phoneservice module is affected by code injection vulnerability, successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service confidentiality and integrity.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2188 | Whitelist bypass Vulnerability in GameCenter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2188</link><description>There is a whitelist mechanism bypass in GameCenter ,successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service confidentiality and integrity.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2197 | Type  Confusion Vulnerability in Browser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2197</link><description>Browser is affected by type confusion vulnerability, successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service availability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3615 | Fluent Forms &amp;lt;= 6.0.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3615</link><description>The Fluent Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form-submission.js script in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
