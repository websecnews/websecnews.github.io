Prior to 0.2.0, the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 15:40:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7129 | code-projects Voting System Voters Login sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7129</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in code-projects Voting System 1.0.

Prior to 1.0.1, WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration is affected by a vulnerability classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability, specifically impacting scenarios where an attacker can manipulate the database. If unauthorized actors gain access to the database, they could exploit this vulnerability to execute object injection attacks. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, or data exfiltration within the WordPress environment.  Users of the plugin should upgrade to version 1.0.1 (or later), where the serialization and deserialization of OrderResponse objects have been switched out to an array stored as JSON.  A possible workaround for users unable to upgrade immediately is to enforce stricter access controls on the database, ensuring that only trusted and authorized entities can modify data. Additionally, implementing monitoring tools to detect unusual database activities could help identify and mitigate potential exploitation attempts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 17:38:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51665 | Audiobookshelf vulnerable to Blind SSRF in `Auth.js`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51665</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.

Prior to version 1.10.11, when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, FreeSWITCH is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the FreeSWITCH server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To address this vulnerability, upgrade FreeSWITCH to 1.10.11 which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 16:39:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50255 | Zip Path Traversal in Deepin-Compressor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50255</link><description>Deepin-Compressor is the default archive manager of Deepin Linux OS.
