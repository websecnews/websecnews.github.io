Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 01:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58359 | frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce group security</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58359</link><description>ZF FROST is a Rust implementation of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimised Schnorr Threshold signatures). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users. Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:59:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58179 | Astro Cloudflare adapter is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery via /_image endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58179</link><description>Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites.

media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check

Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable number
of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicated
by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the
payload size is not being validated against the actual message length.

This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides a
property count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such a
condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks if
memory beyond the buffer is accessed.

Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload before
each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are
parsed.

This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received
message buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware
behavior.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38680 | media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38680</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()

The buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured
that the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen &gt; 2), buf the function
accesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.

Fix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in
uvc_parse_format().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38681 | mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38681</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()

Memory hot remove unmaps and tears down various kernel page table regions
as required.  The ptdump code can race with concurrent modifications of
the kernel page tables.  When leaf entries are modified concurrently, the
dump code may log stale or inconsistent information for a VA range, but
this is otherwise not harmful.

But when intermediate levels of kernel page table are freed, the dump code
will continue to use memory that has been freed and potentially
reallocated for another purpose.  In such cases, the ptdump code may
dereference bogus addresses, leading to a number of potential problems.

To avoid the above mentioned race condition, platforms such as arm64,
riscv and s390 take memory hotplug lock, while dumping kernel page table
via the sysfs interface /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables.

Similar race condition exists while checking for pages that might have
been marked W+X via /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables/check_wx_pages
which in turn calls ptdump_check_wx().  Instead of solving this race
condition again, let's just move the memory hotplug lock inside generic
ptdump_check_wx() which will benefit both the scenarios.

Drop get_online_mems() and put_online_mems() combination from all existing
platform ptdump code paths.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38682 | i2c: core: Fix double-free of fwnode in i2c_unregister_device()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38682</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: core: Fix double-free of fwnode in i2c_unregister_device()

Before commit df6d7277e552 ("i2c: core: Do not dereference fwnode in struct
device"), i2c_unregister_device() only called fwnode_handle_put() on
of_node-s in the form of calling of_node_put(client-&gt;dev.of_node).

But after this commit the i2c_client's fwnode now unconditionally gets
fwnode_handle_put() on it.

When the i2c_client has no primary (ACPI / OF) fwnode but it does have
a software fwnode, the software-node will be the primary node and
fwnode_handle_put() will put() it.

But for the software fwnode device_remove_software_node() will also put()
it leading to a double free:

net/sched: ets: use old 'nbands' while purging unused classes

Shuang reported sch_ets test-case [1] crashing in ets_class_qlen_notify()
after recent changes from Lion [2]. The problem is: in ets_qdisc_change()
we purge unused DWRR queues; the value of 'q-&gt;nbands' is the new one, and
the cleanup should be done with the old one. The problem is here since my
first attempts to fix ets_qdisc_change(), but it surfaced again after the
recent qdisc len accounting fixes. Fix it purging idle DWRR queues before
assigning a new value of 'q-&gt;nbands', so that all purge operations find a
consistent configuration:

 - old 'q-&gt;nbands' because it's needed by ets_class_find()
 - old 'q-&gt;nstrict' because it's needed by ets_class_is_strict()

fbdev: Fix vmalloc out-of-bounds write in fast_imageblit

This issue triggers when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP by passing console number and frame buffer number.
Ideally this maps console to frame buffer and updates the screen if
console is visible.

As part of mapping it has to do resize of console according to frame
buffer info. if this resize fails and returns from vc_do_resize() and
continues further. At this point console and new frame buffer are mapped
and sets display vars. Despite failure still it continue to proceed
updating the screen at later stages where vc_data is related to previous
frame buffer and frame buffer info and display vars are mapped to new
frame buffer and eventully leading to out-of-bounds write in
fast_imageblit(). This bheviour is excepted only when fg_console is
equal to requested console which is a visible console and updates screen
with invalid struct references in fbcon_putcs().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38686 | userfaultfd: fix a crash in UFFDIO_MOVE when PMD is a migration entry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38686</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: fix race between polling and detaching

syzbot reports a use-after-free in comedi in the below link, which is
due to comedi gladly removing the allocated async area even though poll
requests are still active on the wait_queue_head inside of it. This can
cause a use-after-free when the poll entries are later triggered or
removed, as the memory for the wait_queue_head has been freed.  We need
to check there are no tasks queued on any of the subdevices' wait queues
before allowing the device to be detached by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`
ioctl.

Tasks will read-lock `dev-&gt;attach_lock` before adding themselves to the
subdevice wait queue, so fix the problem in the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl
handler by write-locking `dev-&gt;attach_lock` before checking that all of
the subdevices are safe to be deleted.  This includes testing for any
sleepers on the subdevices' wait queues.  It remains locked until the
device has been detached.  This requires the `comedi_device_detach()`
function to be refactored slightly, moving the bulk of it into new
function `comedi_device_detach_locked()`.

Note that the refactor of `comedi_device_detach()` results in
`comedi_device_cancel_all()` now being called while `dev-&gt;attach_lock`
is write-locked, which wasn't the case previously, but that does not
matter.

Thanks to Jens Axboe for diagnosing the problem and co-developing this
patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38688 | iommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38688</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow

When allocating IOVA the candidate range gets aligned to the target
alignment. If the range is close to ULONG_MAX then the ALIGN() can
wrap resulting in a corrupted iova.

Open code the ALIGN() using get_add_overflow() to prevent this.
This simplifies the checks as we don't need to check for length earlier
either.

Consolidate the two copies of this code under a single helper.

This bug would allow userspace to create a mapping that overlaps with some

x86/fpu: Fix NULL dereference in avx512_status()

Problem
-------
With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU enabled, reading /proc/[kthread]/arch_status
causes a warning and a NULL pointer dereference.

This is because the AVX-512 timestamp code uses x86_task_fpu() but
doesn't check it for NULL. CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU addles that function
for kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.

The point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access
task-&gt;fpu after going through kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all
kernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task-&gt;fpu.

Solution
--------
One option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from
x86_task_fpu(). However, that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a
defense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel threads.

Instead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads
altogether. The data was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is
only updated for user threads, not kernel threads.

If anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come
back later and do it properly, separate from this bug fix.

drm/xe/migrate: prevent infinite recursion

If the buf + offset is not aligned to XE_CAHELINE_BYTES we fallback to
using a bounce buffer. However the bounce buffer here is allocated on
the stack, and the only alignment requirement here is that it's
naturally aligned to u8, and not XE_CACHELINE_BYTES. If the bounce
buffer is also misaligned we then recurse back into the function again,
however the new bounce buffer might also not be aligned, and might never
be until we eventually blow through the stack, as we keep recursing.

Instead of using the stack use kmalloc, which should respect the
power-of-two alignment request here. Fixes a kernel panic when
triggering this path through eudebug.

v2 (Stuart):
 - Add build bug check for power-of-two restriction

pNFS: Fix uninited ptr deref in block/scsi layout

The error occurs on the third attempt to encode extents. When function
ext_tree_prepare_commit() reallocates a larger buffer to retry encoding
extents, the "layoutupdate_pages" page array is initialized only after the
retry loop. But ext_tree_free_commitdata() is called on every iteration
and tries to put pages in the array, thus dereferencing uninitialized
pointers.

An additional problem is that there is no limit on the maximum possible
buffer_size. When there are too many extents, the client may create a
layoutcommit that is larger than the maximum possible RPC size accepted
by the server.

During testing, we observed two typical scenarios. First, one memory page
for extents is enough when we work with small files, append data to the
end of the file, or preallocate extents before writing. But when we fill
a new large file without preallocating, the number of extents can be huge,
and counting the number of written extents in ext_tree_encode_commit()
does not help much. Since this number increases even more between
unlocking and locking of ext_tree, the reallocated buffer may not be
large enough again and again.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38692 | exfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38692</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Xe can free some of the data pointed to by the dma-fences it exports. Most
notably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes the associated
submit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a
third party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use-
after-free on subsequent access.

To make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly
documented dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period
between signalling a fence and freeing any data pointed to by said fence.

For the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed via kfree_rcu and
for the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace
period before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38704 | rcu/nocb: Fix possible invalid rdp&amp;#x27;s-&amp;gt;nocb_cb_kthread pointer access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38704</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This was reproduced with topology loading and marking a link as ignore

On module removal the soc_tplg_remove_link() would call
snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() with rtd == NULL since the link was ignored,

drbd: add missing kref_get in handle_write_conflicts

With `two-primaries` enabled, DRBD tries to detect "concurrent" writes
and handle write conflicts, so that even if you write to the same sector
simultaneously on both nodes, they end up with the identical data once
the writes are completed.

In handling "superseeded" writes, we forgot a kref_get,
resulting in a premature drbd_destroy_device and use after free,
and further to kernel crashes with symptoms.

Relevance: No one should use DRBD as a random data generator, and apparently
all users of "two-primaries" handle concurrent writes correctly on layer up.
That is cluster file systems use some distributed lock manager,
and live migration in virtualization environments stops writes on one node
before starting writes on the other node.

Which means that other than for "test cases",
this code path is never taken in real life.

FYI, in DRBD 9, things are handled differently nowadays.  We still detect
"write conflicts", but no longer try to be smart about them.
We decided to disconnect hard instead: upper layers must not submit concurrent
writes. If they do, that's their fault.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38709 | loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38709</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner

Syzbot came up with a reproducer where a loop device block size is
changed underneath a mounted filesystem. This causes a mismatch between
the block device block size and the block size stored in the superblock
causing confusion in various places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular
issue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow() due to
requested buffer size not matching block device block size.

Fix the problem by getting exclusive hold of the loop device to change
its block size. This fails if somebody (such as filesystem) has already
an exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying
the loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn't expect it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38710 | gfs2: Validate i_depth for exhash directories</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38710</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Validate i_depth for exhash directories

A fuzzer test introduced corruption that ends up with a depth of 0 in
dir_e_read(), causing an undefined shift by 32 at:

  index = hash &gt;&gt; (32 - dip-&gt;i_depth);

As calculated in an open-coded way in dir_make_exhash(), the minimum
depth for an exhash directory is ilog2(sdp-&gt;sd_hash_ptrs) and 0 is
invalid as sdp-&gt;sd_hash_ptrs is fixed as sdp-&gt;bsize / 16 at mount time.

So we can avoid the undefined behaviour by checking for depth values
lower than the minimum in gfs2_dinode_in(). Values greater than the
maximum are already being checked for there.

Also switch the calculation in dir_make_exhash() to use ilog2() to
clarify how the depth is calculated.

Tested with the syzkaller repro.c and xfstests '-g quick'.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38711 | smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38711</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists

If smb2_create_link() is called with ReplaceIfExists set and the name
does exist then a deadlock will happen.

ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_locked() will return with success and the parent
directory will be locked.  ksmbd_vfs_remove_file() will then remove the
file.  ksmbd_vfs_link() will then be called while the parent is still
locked.  It will try to lock the same parent and will deadlock.

This patch moves the ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_unlock() call to *before*
ksmbd_vfs_link() and then simplifies the code, removing the file_present
flag variable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38712 | hfsplus: don&amp;#x27;t use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38712</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When the volume header contains erroneous values that do not reflect

hfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_bnode_read()

This patch introduces is_bnode_offset_valid() method that checks
the requested offset value. Also, it introduces
check_and_correct_requested_length() method that checks and
correct the requested length (if it is necessary). These methods
are used in hfs_bnode_read(), hfs_bnode_write(), hfs_bnode_clear(),
hfs_bnode_copy(), and hfs_bnode_move() with the goal to prevent
the access out of allocated memory and triggering the crash.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38716 | hfs: fix general protection fault in hfs_find_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38716</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kcm_unattach() is missing a check of the flag
kcm-&gt;tx_stopped before calling queue_work().

If the kcm has a reserved psock, kcm_unattach() might get executed
between cancel_work_sync() and unreserve_psock() in kcm_release(),

net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue

Currently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in
pci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in
pci_error_handlers.reset_done().

However, in the PCI framework:
pci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -
 pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler-&gt;reset_prepare(dev);

In pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked():
	list_for_each_entry(dev, &amp;amp;slot-&gt;bus-&gt;devices, bus_list) {
		if (!dev-&gt;slot || dev-&gt;slot!= slot)
			continue;
		pci_dev_save_and_disable(dev);
		if (dev-&gt;subordinate)
			pci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev-&gt;subordinate);
	}

This will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute
err_handler-&gt;reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver
to sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.

Since the driver now executes netif_device_detach()
before the reset process, it will not concurrently with
other netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.

Therefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and
adjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure
that multiple resets are not executed concurrently.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38721 | netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38721</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump

There is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():
      if (res &lt; 0) {
                nf_conntrack_get(&amp;amp;ct-&gt;ct_general); // HERE
                cb-&gt;args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
                ...

While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.
If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.
This 2nd increment is never undone.

This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn
keeps prevents cnet-&gt;count from dropping back to 0.

This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as
nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.

This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.
It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before
I see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.

One fix would to change this to:
        if (res &lt; 0) {
		if (ct != last)
	                nf_conntrack_get(&amp;amp;ct-&gt;ct_general);

But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.
We can just store a cookie value instead.

A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,
it looks to me as if this has the same problem and like
ctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual
object so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38722 | habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38722</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its -&gt;release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
habanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to
another struct file that will be dropped as part of -&gt;release() for ours;
that "will be" is actually "might have already been".

Fix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install()
only when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer
have the failure exit with file already created, but reference to
underlying file (as well as -&gt;dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet;
unlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38723 | LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38723</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall

Lei Lu recently reported that nfsd4_setclientid_confirm() did not check
the return value from get_client_locked(). a SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM could
race with a confirmed client expiring and fail to get a reference. That
could later lead to a UAF.

Fix this by getting a reference early in the case where there is an
extant confirmed client. If that fails then treat it as if there were no
confirmed client found at all.

In the case where the unconfirmed client is expiring, just fail and
return the result from get_client_locked().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38725 | net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38725</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy
device will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system
suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will
directly deference member of phydev-&gt;drv for non-main phy devices. Then
NULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or

to check if the just increased rmem value fits into the socket's receive
buffer. If not, it proceeds and tries to wait for the memory under:

  rmem + skb-&gt;truesize &gt; READ_ONCE(sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf)

The checks don't cover the case when skb-&gt;truesize + sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc is
equal to sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf. Thus the function neither successfully accepts
these conditions, nor manages to reschedule the task - and is called in
retry loop for indefinite time which is caught as:

io_uring/net: commit partial buffers on retry

Ring provided buffers are potentially only valid within the single
execution context in which they were acquired. io_uring deals with this
and invalidates them on retry. But on the networking side, if
MSG_WAITALL is set, or if the socket is of the streaming type and too
little was processed, then it will hang on to the buffer rather than
recycle or commit it. This is problematic for two reasons:

1) If someone unregisters the provided buffer ring before a later retry,
   then the req-&gt;buf_list will no longer be valid.

2) If multiple sockers are using the same buffer group, then multiple
   receives can consume the same memory. This can cause data corruption
   in the application, as either receive could land in the same
   userspace buffer.

Fix this by disallowing partial retries from pinning a provided buffer
across multiple executions, if ring provided buffers are used.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43184 | IBM Jazz Foundation cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43184</link><description>IBM Jazz Foundation 7.0.2 through 7.0.2 iFix033, 7.0.3 through 7.0.3 iFix012, and 7.1.0 through 7.1.0 iFix002 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

This endpoint uses the sites query parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list of site identifiers or keys.

The vulnerability was triggered via the sites parameter, which was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization. 

Exploitation allowed an authenticated attacker with low privileges to extract data from database, perform privilege escalation, or trigger denial-of-service conditions. 

The vulnerability was verified using tools such as SQLMap and confirmed to allow full database exfiltration and potential denial-of-service conditions via crafted payloads.

The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of dotCMS stack: 25.08.14 / 25.07.10-1v2 LTS / 24.12.27v10 LTS / 24.04.24v21 LTS</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57263 | An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in VX Guestbook 1.07 allows attackers with admin access to inject malicious SQL payloads via th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57263</link><description>An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in VX Guestbook 1.07 allows attackers with admin access to inject malicious SQL payloads via the "word" POST parameter in the words.php admin panel.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:34:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7388 | Authenticated Command Injection via configuration parameter manipulation in exposed RMI interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7388</link><description>It was possible to perform Remote Command Execution (RCE) via Java

In versions below 1.32.10 and 1.33.0 through 1.33.6, 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0, insufficient Session Expiration in the Envoy OAuth2 filter leads to failed logout operations. When configured with __Secure- or __Host- prefixed cookie names, the filter fails to append the required Secure attribute to the Set-Cookie header during deletion. Modern browsers ignore this invalid request, causing the session cookie to persist. This allows a user to remain logged in after they believe they have logged out, creating a session hijacking risk on shared computers. The current implementation iterates through the configured cookie names to generate deletion headers but does not check for these prefixes. This failure to properly construct the deletion header means the user's session cookies are never removed by the browser, leaving the session active and allowing the next user of the same browser to gain unauthorized access to the original user's account and data. This is fixed in versions 1.32.10, 1.33.7, 1.34.5 and 1.35.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 19:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9365 | Fuji Electric FRENIC-Loader 4 Deserialization of Untrusted Data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9365</link><description>Fuji Electric FRENIC-Loader 4 is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data when importing a file through a specified window, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 19:39:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9925 | projectworlds Travel Management System detail.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9925</link><description>A vulnerability was found in projectworlds Travel Management System 1.0.

When a client initiates an HTTPS connection, the server performs the SSL handshake before assigning the connection to a processing slot. However, there is no specific timeout set for this phase, and the server uses the default socket timeout, which is effectively infinite. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malformed TLS ClientHello message with incorrect length values. This causes the server to wait indefinitely for data that never arrives, blocking the worker thread (Line) handling the connection. By opening multiple such connections, up to the server's maximum limit, the attacker can exhaust all available working threads, preventing the server from handling new, legitimate requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56752 | A vulnerability in the Ruijie RG-ES series switch firmware ESW_1.0(1)B1P39 enables remote attackers to fully bypass authentication mechanism...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56752</link><description>A vulnerability in the Ruijie RG-ES series switch firmware ESW_1.0(1)B1P39 enables remote attackers to fully bypass authentication mechanisms, providing them with unrestricted access to alter administrative settings and potentially seize control of affected devices via crafted HTTP POST request to /user.cgi.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56803 | Figma Desktop for Windows version 125.6.5 contains a command injection vulnerability in the local plugin loader.

This occurs because user-supplied input is reflected back in the server’s response without proper sanitization or escaping, potentially enabling malicious actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions in the application.

DetailsThe vulnerability resides in the “Tags” input field on the /s/ajax?action=lead:addLeadTags endpoint. Although the server applies sanitization before storing the data or returning it later, the payload is executed immediately in the victim’s browser upon reflection, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s session.

ImpactA Reflected XSS attack can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data like cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, manipulate the web page content, and essentially take control of a user's session within an application by executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, even if the server-side code is secure; essentially enabling them to perform actions as if they were the logged-in user.

This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.

PatchesThis vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.

Technical DetailsThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:

  *  A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)
  *  An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)


The fix introduces a TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.

netfilter: nf_tables: reject duplicate device on updates

A chain/flowtable update with duplicated devices in the same batch is
possible. Unfortunately, netdev event path only removes the first
device that is found, leaving unregistered the hook of the duplicated
device.

Check if a duplicated device exists in the transaction batch, bail out
with EEXIST in such case.

WARNING is hit when unregistering the hook:

The framework automatically reads the entire request body on every HTTP request, regardless of whether the application needs it. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with large payloads, causing excessive memory consumption and potentially exhausting available server memory, leading to application crashes or service unavailability. The vulnerability was fixed in v1.2 by implementing lazy loading of request bodies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:42:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13063 | IDOR in Akinsoft&amp;#x27;s MyRezzta</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13063</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Akinsoft MyRezzta allows Forceful Browsing.This issue affects MyRezzta: from s2.02.02 before v2.05.01.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:42:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9219 | Post SMTP &amp;lt;= 3.4.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited Plugin Option Update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9219</link><description>The Post SMTP – WP SMTP Plugin with Email Logs and Mobile App for Failure Notifications – Gmail SMTP, Office 365, Brevo, Mailgun, Amazon SES and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'update_post_smtp_pro_option_callback' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.1.

certificates for Print Deploy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9785</link><description>PaperCut Print Deploy is an optional component that integrates with PaperCut NG/MF which simplifies printer deployment and management. When the component is deployed to an environment, the customer has an option to configure the system to use a self-signed certificate. If the customer does not fully configure the system to leverage the trust database on the clients, it opens up the communication between clients and the server to man-in-the-middle attacks. 

It was discovered that certain parts of the documentation related to the configuration of SSL in Print Deploy were lacking, which could potentially contribute to a misconfiguration of the Print Deploy client installation. PaperCut strongly recommends to use valid certificates to secure installations and to follow the updated documentation to ensure the correct SSL configuration. Those who use private CAs and/or self-signed certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority certificate, or their self signed certificate if using only one, to the trust store of their operating system and to the Java key store</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:39:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58176 | Dive&amp;#x27;s improper processing of custom urls can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58176</link><description>Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58176 | Dive&amp;#x27;s improper processing of custom urls can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58176</link><description>Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object.

In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:35:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7039 | Glib: buffer under-read on glib through glib/gfileutils.c via get_tmp_file()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7039</link><description>A flaw was found in glib. An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58163 | FreeScout&amp;#x27;s deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58163</link><description>FreeScout is a free help desk and shared inbox built with PHP's Laravel framework. In versions 1.8.185 and below, the application performs deserialization of data that can allow authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited via endpoint: `/help/{mailbox_id}/auth/{customer_id}/{hash}/{timestamp}` where the `customer_id` and `timestamp` parameters are processed through the decrypt function in `app/Helper.php` without proper validation. The vulnerable code performs decryption using Laravel's built-in encryption functions, which subsequently deserializes the decrypted payload without sanitization. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9847 | ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System register.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9847</link><description>A weakness has been identified in ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System 1.0.
