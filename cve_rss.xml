Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file \EasySpider\resources\app\server.js of the component HTTP GET Request Handler. The manipulation with the input /../../../../../../../../../Windows/win.ini leads to path traversal: '../filedir'. The attack needs to be done within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-271477 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The code maintainer explains, that this is not a big issue "because the default is that the software runs locally without going through the Internet".</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 12:29:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6745 | code-projects Simple Ticket Booking Login adminauthenticate.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6745</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in code-projects Simple Ticket Booking 1.0.

tcp: avoid too many retransmit packets

If a TCP socket is using TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, and the other peer
retracted its window to zero, tcp_retransmit_timer() can
retransmit a packet every two jiffies (2 ms for HZ=1000),
for about 4 minutes after TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has 'expired'.

The fix is to make sure tcp_rtx_probe0_timed_out() takes
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout into account.

Before blamed commit, the socket would not timeout after
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout, but would use standard exponential
backoff for the retransmits.

Also worth noting that before commit e89688e3e978 ("net: tcp:
fix unexcepted socket die when snd_wnd is 0"), the issue
would last 2 minutes instead of 4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32945 | LaTeX post content manipulation via renderer state leak across contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32945</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to protect against abuse of a globally shared MathJax stateÂ which allows an attacker to change the contents of a LateX post, by creating another post with specific  macro definitions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39767 | Spoofed push notifications from malicious server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39767</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to validate that the push notifications received for a server actually came from this serve that which allows a malicious server to send push notifications with another serverâs diagnostic ID or server URL and have them show up in mobile apps as that serverâs push notifications.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6741 | Openfind Mail2000 - HttpOnly flag bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6741</link><description>Openfind's Mail2000 has a vulnerability that allows the HttpOnly flag to be bypassed.

SUNRPC: Fix UAF in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready()

After the listener svc_sock is freed, and before invoking svc_tcp_accept()
for the established child sock, there is a window that the newsock
retaining a freed listener svc_sock in sk_user_data which cloning from
parent. In the race window, if data is received on the newsock, we will
observe use-after-free report in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready().

Reproduce by two tasks:

1. while :; do rpc.nfsd 0 ; rpc.nfsd; done
2. while :; do echo "" | ncat -4 127.0.0.1 2049 ; done

Fix the UAF by simply doing nothing in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready()
if state != TCP_LISTEN, that will avoid dereferencing svsk for all
child socket.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 07:20:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6730 | Nanjing Xingyuantu Technology SparkShop uploadFile unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6730</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Nanjing Xingyuantu Technology SparkShop up to 1.1.6.
