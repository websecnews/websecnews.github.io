Prior to version 1.28. Mailpit's SMTP server is vulnerable to Header Injection due to an insufficient Regular Expression used to validate `RCPT TO` and `MAIL FROM` addresses. An attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP headers (or corrupt existing ones) by including carriage return characters (`\r`) in the email address. This header injection occurs because the regex intended to filter control characters fails to exclude `\r` and `\n` when used inside a character class. Version 1.28.3 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15538 | Open Asset Import Library Assimp LWOMaterial.cpp FindUVChannels use after free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15538</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in Open Asset Import Library Assimp up to 6.0.2.

Prior to version 2.46.0, Kimai's export functionality uses a Twig sandbox with an overly permissive security policy (`DefaultPolicy`) that allows arbitrary method calls on objects available in the template context. An authenticated user with export permissions can deploy a malicious Twig template that extracts sensitive information including environment variables, all user password hashes, serialized session tokens, and CSRF tokens. Version 2.46.0 patches this issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:55:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23525 | 1panel App Store vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23525</link><description>1Panel is an open-source, web-based control panel for Linux server management. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 1Panel App Store when viewing application details. Malicious scripts can execute in the context of the user’s browser, potentially compromising session data or sensitive system interfaces. All versions of 1Panel up to and including v1.10.33-lts and v2.0.16 are affected. An attacker could publish a malicious application that, when loaded by users (locally or remotely), can execute arbitrary scripts. This may result in theft of user cookies, unauthorized access to system functions, or other actions that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of content rendered by the MdEditor component with the `previewOnly` attribute enabled. Specifically, the App Store renders application README content without proper XSS protection, allowing script execution during content rendering; and similar issues exist in system upgrade-related components, which can be fixed by implementing proper XSS sanitization in the MdEditor component. These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by applying proper XSS protection and sanitization when rendering content in the MdEditor component. Safe versions with a patch incorporated are v1.10.34-lts and v2.0.17.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:29:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1126 | lwj flow SVG File FormResource.java uploadFile unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1126</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in lwj flow up to a3d2fe8133db9d3b50fda4f66f68634640344641.

The vulnerability can be exploited via the Code block by an authenticated user with basic permissions and can lead to a full n8n instance takeover on instances operating under "Internal" execution mode.

If the instance is operating under the  "External" execution mode (ex. n8n's official Docker image) - arbitrary code execution occurs inside a Sidecar container and not the main node, which significantly reduces the vulnerability impact.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:41:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1124 | Yonyou KSOA HTTP GET Parameter work_report.jsp sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1124</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in Yonyou KSOA 9.0.

This is due to the plugin exposing a public AJAX endpoint (`wppaypalcheckout_ajax_process_order`) that processes checkout results without any authentication or server-side verification of the PayPal transaction. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary orders on the site with any chosen transaction ID, payment status, product name, amount, or customer information via direct POST requests to the AJAX endpoint, granted they can bypass basic parameter validation. If email sending is enabled, the plugin will also trigger purchase receipt emails to any email address supplied in the request, leading to order database corruption and unauthorized outgoing emails without any real PayPal transaction taking place.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:04:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0682 | Church Admin &amp;lt;= 5.0.28 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Blind Server-Side Request Forgery via &amp;#x27;audio_url&amp;#x27; Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0682</link><description>The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.28 due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs in the 'audio_url' parameter.
