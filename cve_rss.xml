As the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With this, it's possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 23:13:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55062 | EasyVirt DCScope 8.6.0 and earlier and co2Scope 1.3.0 and earlier are vulnerable to Command injection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55062</link><description>EasyVirt DCScope 8.6.0 and earlier and co2Scope 1.3.0 and earlier are vulnerable to Command injection.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 21:54:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57587 | EasyVirt DCScope 8.6.0 and earlier and co2Scope 1.3.0 and earlier are vulnerable to SQL Injection on the authentication portal.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57587</link><description>EasyVirt DCScope 8.6.0 and earlier and co2Scope 1.3.0 and earlier are vulnerable to SQL Injection on the authentication portal.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 21:54:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53354 | EasyVirt DCScope &lt;=8.6.0 and CO2Scope &lt;=1.3.0 are vulnerable to SQL Injection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53354</link><description>EasyVirt DCScope &lt;=8.6.0 and CO2Scope &lt;=1.3.0 are vulnerable to SQL Injection.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 21:47:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53355 | EasyVirt DCScope &lt;=8.6.0 and CO2Scope &lt;=1.3.0 are vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control.

vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]

Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()
when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached
links), but we shouldn't.

Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have
more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0
(no space, no data available) but with a warning.

This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state
and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21667 | iomap: avoid avoid truncating 64-bit offset to 32 bits</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21667</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,
we must discard any packets received because they are not expected
and would cause issues when we access vsk-&gt;transport.

A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,
where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second
connect() failed, we can find `vsk-&gt;transport` at NULL, leading to a
NULL pointer dereference.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21670 | vsock/bpf: return early if transport is not assigned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21670</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot reported a lock held when returning to userspace[1].  This is
because if argc is less than 0 and the function returns directly, the held

Fix this by store the error in ret and jump to done to clean up instead of
returning directly.

definers are destroyed. That's because the mlx5_lag_destroy_definers()
always try to destroy all lag definers in the tt_map, so in the flow
below lag definers get double-destroyed and cause kernel crash:

  mlx5_lag_port_sel_create()
    mlx5_lag_create_definers()
      mlx5_lag_create_definer()     &lt;- Failed on tt 1
        mlx5_lag_destroy_definers() &lt;- definers[tt=0] gets destroyed
  mlx5_lag_port_sel_create()
    mlx5_lag_create_definers()
      mlx5_lag_create_definer()     &lt;- Failed on tt 0
        mlx5_lag_destroy_definers() &lt;- definers[tt=0] gets double-destroyed

net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

The fec_enet_update_cbd function calls page_pool_dev_alloc_pages but did
not handle the case when it returned NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory
pressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some
frequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an
imx6q.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve
the problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver
ignores the memory allocation error and can crash.

This commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21677 | pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket&amp;#x27;s netns dismantle.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21677</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns dismantle.

pfcp_newlink() links the device to a list in dev_net(dev) instead
of net, where a udp tunnel socket is created.

Even when net is removed, the device stays alive on dev_net(dev).
Then, removing net triggers the splat below. [0]

In this example, pfcp0 is created in ns2, but the udp socket is
created in ns1.

  ip netns add ns1
  ip netns add ns2
  ip -n ns1 link add netns ns2 name pfcp0 type pfcp
  ip netns del ns1

Let's link the device to the socket's netns instead.

Now, pfcp_net_exit() needs another netdev iteration to remove
all pfcp devices in the netns.

pfcp_dev_list is not used under RCU, so the list API is converted
to the non-RCU variant.

pfcp_net_exit() can be converted to .exit_batch_rtnl() in net-next.

Inside function get_canonical_dev_path(), we call d_path() to get the

But d_path() can return error, and in that case the next strscpy() call
will trigger an invalid memory access.

When device is unregistering, the 'dev-&gt;real_num_tx_queues' goes to
zero and the 'while (unlikely(hash &gt;= qcount))' loop inside the
'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.

But unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to
fix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering
state while reporting carrier status OK.

One example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON
on start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.
And it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.
Therefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit
the infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There
might be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is
important for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a
packet sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the
issue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.

Fix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running
state is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers
unregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets
to devices that are not running anyway.

While only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier
check is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined
throughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions
like __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit
a packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21682 | eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-deref</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21682</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-deref

Recalculate features when XDP is detached.

Before:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: off [requested on]

After:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: on

The fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is just
a minor annoyance. The real issue is that the features will randomly
come back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invoke
netdev_update_features(). The driver doesn't handle reconfiguring
two things at a time very robustly.

Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 ("bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()") we only reconfigure the RSS hash table
if the "effective" number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO is
enabled "effective" number of rings is 2x what user sees.
So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement "pending"
after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO rings
doing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out,
and the:

  if (old_rx_rings != bp-&gt;hw_resc.resv_rx_rings &amp;&amp;

condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.
The RSS map won't get updated, and we'll crash with:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000168
  RIP: 0010:__bnxt_hwrm_vnic_set_rss+0x13a/0x1a0

    bnxt_open_nic+0x2b/0x60
    ethtool_set_channels+0x18c/0x1d0

As we try to access a freed ring.

The issue is present since XDP support was added, really, but
prior to commit 98ba1d931f61 ("bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()") it wasn't causing major issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21683 | bpf: Fix bpf_sk_select_reuseport() memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

As pointed out in the original comment, lookup in sockmap can return a TCP
ESTABLISHED socket. Such TCP socket may have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF
set before it was ESTABLISHED. In other words, a non-NULL sk_reuseport_cb
does not imply a non-refcounted socket.

Drop sk's reference in both error paths.
