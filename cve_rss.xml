Attackers could use the potentially predictable nonce value used for authentication purposes in the OAuth flow to conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness is used while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating API keys in the database package.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 05:13:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21496 | All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to i...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21496</link><description>All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&amp;], [&lt;], [&gt;], ["], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target user’s browser, compromising user sessions.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 05:13:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21497 | All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Open Redirect via the redirect_url parameter.
