Prior to 2.7.0, there is a critical sandbox escape vulnerability in enclave-vm that allows untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript code to execute arbitrary code in the host Node.js runtime. When a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a host-side Error object to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its host realm prototype chain, which can be traversed to reach the host Function constructor. An attacker can intentionally trigger a host error, then climb the prototype chain. Using the host Function constructor, arbitrary JavaScript can be compiled and executed in the host context, fully bypassing the sandbox and granting access to sensitive resources such as process.env, filesystem, and network. This breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:32:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0716 | Libsoup: out-of-bounds read in libsoup websocket frame processing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0716</link><description>A flaw was found in libsoup’s WebSocket frame processing when handling incoming messages.

Prior to 4.11.4, there is a flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the JWT header’s alg value to influence signature verification when the selected JWK did not explicitly specify an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion and, in certain configurations, allow forged tokens to be accepted. As part of this fix, the JWT middleware now requires the alg option to be explicitly specified. This prevents algorithm confusion by ensuring that the verification algorithm is not derived from untrusted JWT header values. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:59:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22818 | JWT algorithm confusion in Hono JWK Auth Middleware when JWK lacks &amp;quot;alg&amp;quot; (untrusted header.alg fallback)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22818</link><description>Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.

From 5.0.0 to 6.10.1, OpenC3 COSMOS contains a critical remote code execution vulnerability reachable through the JSON-RPC API. When a JSON-RPC request uses the string form of certain APIs, attacker-controlled parameter text is parsed into values using String#convert_to_value. For array-like inputs, convert_to_value executes eval(). Because the cmd code path parses the command string before calling authorize(), an unauthenticated attacker can trigger Ruby code execution even though the request ultimately fails authorization (401).

From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:01:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21275 | InDesign Desktop | Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21275</link><description>InDesign Desktop versions 21.0, 19.5.5 and earlier are affected by an Access of Uninitialized Pointer vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

hfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk

syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode-&gt;i_mode can become bogus when
the S_IFMT bits of the 16bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

According to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS
8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized
with 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when
the "mode" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be
S_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/
S_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir == 0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68768 | inet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68768</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()

We have been seeing occasional deadlocks on pernet_ops_rwsem since
September in NIPA. The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading
a driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.
lockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious
from the reports.

On closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping
forever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience
with occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before
the crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate
red flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting
around, holding conntrack references.

The problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,
nf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its
netns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.

Flush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release
conntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs. Also flush
the queues in timer expiry handlers when they discover fqdir-&gt;dead
is set, in case packet sneaks in while we're running the pre_exit
flush.

The commit under Fixes is not exactly the culprit, but I think
previously the timer firing would eventually unblock the spinning
conntrack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68769 | f2fs: fix return value of f2fs_recover_fsync_data()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68769</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix XDP_TX path

For XDP_TX action in bnxt_rx_xdp(), clearing of the event flags is not
correct.  __bnxt_poll_work() -&gt; bnxt_rx_pkt() -&gt; bnxt_rx_xdp() may be
looping within NAPI and some event flags may be set in earlier
iterations.  In particular, if BNXT_TX_EVENT is set earlier indicating
some XDP_TX packets are ready and pending, it will be cleared if it is
XDP_TX action again.  Normally, we will set BNXT_TX_EVENT again when we
successfully call __bnxt_xmit_xdp().  But if the TX ring has no more
room, the flag will not be set.  This will cause the TX producer to be
ahead but the driver will not hit the TX doorbell.

For multi-buf XDP_TX, there is no need to clear the event flags and set
BNXT_AGG_EVENT.  The BNXT_AGG_EVENT flag should have been set earlier in
bnxt_rx_pkt().

The visible symptom of this is that the RX ring associated with the
TX XDP ring will eventually become empty and all packets will be dropped.
Because this condition will cause the driver to not refill the RX ring
seeing that the TX ring has forever pending XDP_TX packets.

The fix is to only clear BNXT_RX_EVENT when we have successfully
called __bnxt_xmit_xdp().</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68771 | ocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68771</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain

syzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the
`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in
the chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl-&gt;cl_next_free_rec)
condition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.

To fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),
just before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being
executed when either of the following conditions is true:

1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free
chains in the allocation chain list
2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of
chains in the allocation chain list)

Either of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no
chains left for usage.

This is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints
the error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the kernel.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68772 | f2fs: fix to avoid updating compression context during writeback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68772</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode

Commit fc96ec826bce ("spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers
with even size") failed to make sure that the size is really even
before switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went
unnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size
PAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.

But commit 8ad6249c51d0 ("eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem API")
introduced an additional dynamically allocated bounce buffer whose size
is exactly the size of the transfer, leading to a buffer overrun in
the fsl-cpm driver when that size is odd.

Add the missing length parity verification and remain in 8 bit mode
when the length is not even.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68774 | hfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68774</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create

When sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may
enter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table
and proceed to create it.

Thread A:
  hfsplus_write_inode()
    -&gt; hfsplus_write_system_inode()
      -&gt; hfs_btree_write()
        -&gt; hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
          -&gt; __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

Thread B:
  hfsplus_create_cat()
    -&gt; hfs_brec_insert()
      -&gt; hfs_bnode_split()
        -&gt; hfs_bmap_alloc()
          -&gt; hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
            -&gt; __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

In this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.
Thread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already
been inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without
getting the node.

```

	node2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);
	if (!node2) {                                 &lt;- Thread A
		hash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);
		node-&gt;next_hash = tree-&gt;node_hash[hash];
		tree-&gt;node_hash[hash] = node;
		tree-&gt;node_hash_cnt++;
	} else {                                      &lt;- Thread B
		spin_unlock(&amp;amp;tree-&gt;hash_lock);
		kfree(node);
		wait_event(node2-&gt;lock_wq,
			!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &amp;amp;node2-&gt;flags));
		return node2;
	}
```

However, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.
Here both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,
this triggers:

BUG_ON(!atomic_read(&amp;amp;node-&gt;refcnt))

In this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table
rather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.

Fix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by
another thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.

A similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit
a9dc087fd3c4 ("fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create")
but the same issue remained in HFS+ until now.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68775 | net/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68775</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket

When a handshake request is cancelled it is removed from the
handshake_net-&gt;hn_requests list, but it is still present in the
handshake_rhashtbl until it is destroyed.

If a second cancellation request arrives for the same handshake request,
then remove_pending() will return false... and assuming
HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED isn't set in req-&gt;hr_flags, we'll continue
processing through the out_true label, where we put another reference on
the sock and a refcount underflow occurs.

This can happen for example if a handshake times out - particularly if
the SUNRPC client sends the AUTH_TLS probe to the server but doesn't
follow it up with the ClientHello due to a problem with tlshd.  When the
timeout is hit on the server, the server will send a FIN, which triggers
a cancellation request via xs_reset_transport().  When the timeout is
hit on the client, another cancellation request happens via
xs_tls_handshake_sync().

Add a test_and_set_bit(HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED) in the pending cancel
path so duplicate cancels can be detected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68776 | net/hsr: fix NULL pointer dereference in prp_get_untagged_frame()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68776</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: ti_am335x_tsc - fix off-by-one error in wire_order validation

The current validation 'wire_order[i] &gt; ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins)' allows
wire_order[i] to equal ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins), which causes out-of-bounds
access when used as index in 'config_pins[wire_order[i]]'.

Since config_pins has 4 elements (indices 0-3), the valid range for

of &gt; in the validation check.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68778 | btrfs: don&amp;#x27;t log conflicting inode if it&amp;#x27;s a dir moved in the current transaction</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68778</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction

We can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved
from one parent directory to another parent directory in the current
transaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with
two hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and
another for the new parent directory.

The following scenario triggers that issue:

1) We have directories "dir1" and "dir2" created in a past transaction.
   Directory "dir1" has inode A as its parent directory;

2) We move "dir1" to some other directory;

3) We create a file with the name "dir1" in directory inode A;

4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file
   and the inode for the directory "dir1" that was previously moved in the
   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the
   new location of "dir1";

5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating
   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the
   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens
   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();

6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the
   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in
   memory);

7) We have a power failure;

8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing
   the inode for directory "dir1" we find a new INODE_REF and add that
   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have
   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode "dir1".

As a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the
subvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have
a directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.

sched/deadline: only set free_cpus for online runqueues

Commit 16b269436b72 ("sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus
to reflect rd-&gt;online") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
functions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated
by the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the
mask would also reflect this state.

Commit 9659e1eeee28 ("sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask
from cpudl_find()") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to
save some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus
mask already reflected the runqueue online state.

Unfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the
cpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the
deadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is
connected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad
state after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU
that is transitioning through the default root domain may push a
deadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its
free_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the
opportunity to run.

One example is outlined here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com

Another occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a
CPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of
the deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear
and set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.

This commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the
online state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask
can be updated appropriately.

It is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the
cpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
functions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is
now only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to
use the non-atomic __cpumask functions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68781 | usb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68781</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal

The delayed work item otg_event is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and
scheduled under two conditions:
1. When a host controller binds to the OTG controller.
2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).

A race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove():
the fsl_otg instance may be freed while the delayed work is still pending
or executing. This leads to use-after-free when the work function
fsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.

The problematic scenario:

(detach thread)            | (delayed work)
fsl_otg_remove()           |
  kfree(fsl_otg_dev) //FREE| fsl_otg_event()
                           |   og = container_of(...) //USE
                           |   og-&gt; //USE

Fix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove()
before deallocating the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work
is properly canceled and completes execution prior to memory deallocation.

This bug was identified through static analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68782 | scsi: target: Reset t_task_cdb pointer in error case</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68782</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-mixer: us16x08: validate meter packet indices

get_meter_levels_from_urb() parses the 64-byte meter packets sent by
the device and fills the per-channel arrays meter_level[],
comp_level[] and master_level[] in struct snd_us16x08_meter_store.

Currently the function derives the channel index directly from the
meter packet (MUB2(meter_urb, s) - 1) and uses it to index those
arrays without validating the range. If the packet contains a
negative or out-of-range channel number, the driver may write past
the end of these arrays.

Introduce a local channel variable and validate it before updating the
arrays. We reject negative indices, limit meter_level[] and
comp_level[] to SND_US16X08_MAX_CHANNELS, and guard master_level[]
updates with ARRAY_SIZE(master_level).</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:55:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68784 | xfs: fix a UAF problem in xattr repair</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68784</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action

The push_nsh() action structure looks like this:

 OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH(OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH(OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE,...))

The outermost OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH attribute is OK'ed by the
nla_for_each_nested() inside __ovs_nla_copy_actions().  The innermost
OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE/MD1/MD2 are OK'ed by the nla_for_each_nested()
inside nsh_key_put_from_nlattr().  But nothing checks if the attribute
in the middle is OK.  We don't even check that this attribute is the
OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH.  We just do a double unwrap with a pair of nla_data()
calls - first time directly while calling validate_push_nsh() and the
second time as part of the nla_for_each_nested() macro, which isn't
safe, potentially causing invalid memory access if the size of this
attribute is incorrect.  The failure may not be noticed during
validation due to larger netlink buffer, but cause trouble later during
action execution where the buffer is allocated exactly to the size:

Let's add some checks that the attribute is properly sized and it's

pushing an NSH header already, it just creates extra nesting, but
that's how uAPI works today.

fsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files

inotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to
subscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the
same user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user
has access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).

Users with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent
directory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified
via atime/mtime change.

The same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not
generally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to
special files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().

Align fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate
ACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.
The events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This
closes some side-channels that could be possibly used for information
exfiltration [1].

Address the issue by only processing known values and returning -EINVAL for
unrecognized values.

Make also 'tpm_buf_append_name' and 'tpm_buf_fill_hmac_session' fallible so
that errors are detected before causing any spurious TPM traffic.

End also the authorization session on failure in both of the functions, as

drm/amdgpu: fix a job-&gt;pasid access race in gpu recovery

Avoid a possible UAF in GPU recovery due to a race between
the sched timeout callback and the tdr work queue.

The gpu recovery function calls drm_sched_stop() and
later drm_sched_start().  drm_sched_start() restarts
the tdr queue which will eventually free the job.  If
the tdr queue frees the job before time out callback
completes, the job will be freed and we'll get a UAF
when accessing the pasid.  Cache it early to avoid the
UAF.

iomap: adjust read range correctly for non-block-aligned positions

iomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that the position and length passed in
are block-aligned. This is not always the case however, as shown in the
syzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be
skipped for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect
position and length to read in. If all the blocks are uptodate, this
underflows length and returns a position beyond the folio.

Fix the calculation to also take into account the block offset when
calculating how many bytes can be skipped for uptodate blocks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68795 | ethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68795</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query

The ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:
ETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and
ETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.

If the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device
reconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,
potentially leading to buffer overflow.

Drivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some
drivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making
this scenario possible.

Some drivers try to handle this internally:
- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not
  equal to the driver's stats count.
- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond
  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.

However, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value
returned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described
here.

Change ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),
ethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch
between userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer
overflow.
The returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that
nothing has been returned.

This could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,
depending on when the size change is detected:
1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():
    # ethtool -S eth2
    no stats available

2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.

Both cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call
should succeed.

Other than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no
output/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting
incorrect/shifted stats.
I also considered returning an error instead of a "silent" response, but
that seems more destructive towards userspace apps.

Notes:
- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure
  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more
  predictable behavior.

- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between
  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.

- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that
  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications
  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,
  to prevent any regressions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68796 | f2fs: fix to avoid updating zero-sized extent in extent cache</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68796</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid
RamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function
unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the
end.

If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist
(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this
command is a global information query and does not target a specific
board context.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68798 | perf/x86/amd: Check event before enable to avoid GPF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68798</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

caif: fix integer underflow in cffrml_receive()

The cffrml_receive() function extracts a length field from the packet
header and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without
validating that len &gt;= 2.

If an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1
to an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer
underflow.

This can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential
information disclosure if padding contains uninitialized kernel memory.

Fix this by validating that len &gt;= 2 before performing the subtraction.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68800 | mlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68800</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats

Cited commit added a dedicated mutex (instead of RTNL) to protect the
multicast route list, so that it will not change while the driver
periodically traverses it in order to update the kernel about multicast
route stats that were queried from the device.

One instance of list entry deletion (during route replace) was missed
and it can result in a use-after-free [1].

Fix by acquiring the mutex before deleting the entry from the list and
releasing it afterwards.

mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free

We sometimes observe use-after-free when dereferencing a neighbour [1].
The problem seems to be that the driver stores a pointer to the
neighbour, but without holding a reference on it. A reference is only
taken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.

Fix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a
reference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid
taking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the
neighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.

Tested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.
Without this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of
iterations.

NFSD: NFSv4 file creation neglects setting ACL

An NFSv4 client that sets an ACL with a named principal during file
creation retrieves the ACL afterwards, and finds that it is only a
default ACL (based on the mode bits) and not the ACL that was
requested during file creation. This violates RFC 8881 section
6.4.1.3: "the ACL attribute is set as given".

The issue occurs in nfsd_create_setattr(), which calls
nfsd_attrs_valid() to determine whether to call nfsd_setattr().
However, nfsd_attrs_valid() checks only for iattr changes and
security labels, but not POSIX ACLs. When only an ACL is present,
the function returns false, nfsd_setattr() is skipped, and the
POSIX ACL is never applied to the inode.

Subsequently, when the client retrieves the ACL, the server finds
no POSIX ACL on the inode and returns one generated from the file's
mode bits rather than returning the originally-specified ACL.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68804 | platform/chrome: cros_ec_ishtp: Fix UAF after unbinding driver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68804</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix race between wbt_enable_default and IO submission

When wbt_enable_default() is moved out of queue freezing in elevator_change(),
it can cause the wbt inflight counter to become negative (-1), leading to hung
tasks in the writeback path. Tasks get stuck in wbt_wait() because the counter
is in an inconsistent state.

The issue occurs because wbt_enable_default() could race with IO submission,
allowing the counter to be decremented before proper initialization. This manifests
as:

  rq_wait[0]:
    inflight:             -1
    has_waiters:        True

rwb_enabled() checks the state, which can be updated exactly between wbt_wait()
(rq_qos_throttle()) and wbt_track()(rq_qos_track()), then the inflight counter
will become negative.

And results in hung task warnings like:
  task:kworker/u24:39 state:D stack:0 pid:14767
  Call Trace:
    rq_qos_wait+0xb4/0x150
    wbt_wait+0xa9/0x100
    __rq_qos_throttle+0x24/0x40
    blk_mq_submit_bio+0x672/0x7b0
    ...

Fix this by:

1. Splitting wbt_enable_default() into:
   - __wbt_enable_default(): Returns true if wbt_init() should be called
   - wbt_enable_default(): Wrapper for existing callers (no init)
   - wbt_init_enable_default(): New function that checks and inits WBT

2. Using wbt_init_enable_default() in blk_register_queue() to ensure
   proper initialization during queue registration

3. Move wbt_init() out of wbt_enable_default() which is only for enabling
   disabled wbt from bfq and iocost, and wbt_init() isn't needed. Then the
   original lock warning can be avoided.

4. Removing the ELEVATOR_FLAG_ENABLE_WBT_ON_EXIT flag and its handling
   code since it's no longer needed

This ensures WBT is properly initialized before any IO can be submitted,
preventing the counter from going negative.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68808 | media: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68808</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership

vidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)
and ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT
tables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),
vidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().

The problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership
transfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the
vidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and
in the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by
vidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed again by
vidtv_psi_*_event_destroy() due to the uninitialized local pointer, so it
is freed once again.

Therefore, to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerability,
local pointers must be initialized to NULL when transferring memory
ownership.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68809 | ksmbd: vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68809</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache

ksmbd maintains delete-on-close and pending-delete state in
ksmbd_inode-&gt;m_flags. In vfs_cache.c this field is accessed under
inconsistent locking: some paths read and modify m_flags under
ci-&gt;m_lock while others do so without taking the lock at all.

Examples:

 - ksmbd_query_inode_status() and __ksmbd_inode_close() use
   ci-&gt;m_lock when checking or updating m_flags.
 - ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),
   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete() and ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()
   used to read and modify m_flags without ci-&gt;m_lock.

This creates a potential data race on m_flags when multiple threads
open, close and delete the same file concurrently. In the worst case
delete-on-close and pending-delete bits can be lost or observed in an
inconsistent state, leading to confusing delete semantics (files that
stay on disk after delete-on-close, or files that disappear while still
in use).

Fix it by:

 - Making ksmbd_query_inode_status() look at m_flags under ci-&gt;m_lock
   after dropping inode_hash_lock.
 - Adding ci-&gt;m_lock protection to all helpers that read or modify
   m_flags (ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),
   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()).
 - Keeping the existing ci-&gt;m_lock protection in __ksmbd_inode_close(),
   and moving the actual unlink/xattr removal outside the lock.

This unifies the locking around m_flags and removes the data race while
preserving the existing delete-on-close behaviour.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68810 | KVM: Disallow toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on an existing memslot</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68810</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Disallow toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on an existing memslot

Reject attempts to disable KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on a memslot that was
initially created with a guest_memfd binding, as KVM doesn't support
toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on existing memslots.  KVM prevents enabling
KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD, but doesn't prevent clearing the flag.

Failure to reject the new memslot results in a use-after-free due to KVM
not unbinding from the guest_memfd instance.  Unbinding on a FLAGS_ONLY
change is easy enough, and can/will be done as a hardening measure (in
anticipation of KVM supporting dirty logging on guest_memfd at some point),
but fixing the use-after-free would only address the immediate symptom.

ipvs: fix ipv4 null-ptr-deref in route error path

The IPv4 code path in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() calls dst_link_failure()
without ensuring skb-&gt;dev is set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference
in fib_compute_spec_dst() when ipv4_link_failure() attempts to send
ICMP destination unreachable messages.

The issue emerged after commit ed0de45a1008 ("ipv4: recompile ip options
in ipv4_link_failure") started calling __ip_options_compile() from
ipv4_link_failure(). This code path eventually calls fib_compute_spec_dst()
which dereferences skb-&gt;dev. An attempt was made to fix the NULL skb-&gt;dev
dereference in commit 0113d9c9d1cc ("ipv4: fix null-deref in
ipv4_link_failure"), but it only addressed the immediate dev_net(skb-&gt;dev)
dereference by using a fallback device. The fix was incomplete because
fib_compute_spec_dst() later in the call chain still accesses skb-&gt;dev
directly, which remains NULL when IPVS calls dst_link_failure().

The crash occurs when:
1. IPVS processes a packet in NAT mode with a misconfigured destination
2. Route lookup fails in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() before establishing a route
3. The error path calls dst_link_failure(skb) with skb-&gt;dev == NULL
4. ipv4_link_failure() → ipv4_send_dest_unreach() →
   __ip_options_compile() → fib_compute_spec_dst()
5. fib_compute_spec_dst() dereferences NULL skb-&gt;dev

Apply the same fix used for IPv6 in commit 326bf17ea5d4 ("ipvs: fix
ipv6 route unreach panic"): set skb-&gt;dev from skb_dst(skb)-&gt;dev before
calling dst_link_failure().

io_uring: fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()

 __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using getname(). However,
for the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table as
well as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that
point, the request doesn't have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this,
the memory for the newly allocated struct filename is not cleaned up,
causing a memory leak.

Fix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP for the request just after the
successful getname() call, so that when the request is torn down, the
filename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68815 | net/sched: ets: Remove drr class from the active list if it changes to strict</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68815</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: ets: Remove drr class from the active list if it changes to strict

Whenever a user issues an ets qdisc change command, transforming a

class was in the active list and removing it. This means that, if a
user changes a strict class (which was in the active list) back to a drr
one, that class will be added twice to the active list [1].

Add validation for format string parameters in the firmware tracer to
prevent potential security vulnerabilities and crashes from malformed
format strings received from firmware.

The firmware tracer receives format strings from the device firmware and
uses them to format trace messages. Without proper validation, bad
firmware could provide format strings with invalid format specifiers
(e.g., %s, %p, %n) that could lead to crashes, or other undefined
behavior.

Add mlx5_tracer_validate_params() to validate that all format specifiers
in trace strings are limited to safe integer/hex formats (%x, %d, %i,
%u, %llx, %lx, etc.). Reject strings containing other format types that
could be used to access arbitrary memory or cause crashes.
Invalid format strings are added to the trace output for visibility with

fuse: fix readahead reclaim deadlock

Commit e26ee4efbc79 ("fuse: allocate ff-&gt;release_args only if release is
needed") skips allocating ff-&gt;release_args if the server does not
implement open. However in doing so, fuse_prepare_release() now skips
grabbing the reference on the inode, which makes it possible for an
inode to be evicted from the dcache while there are inflight readahead
requests. This causes a deadlock if the server triggers reclaim while
servicing the readahead request and reclaim attempts to evict the inode
of the file being read ahead. Since the folio is locked during
readahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()
attempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page
cache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting
for the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is
itself blocked in reclaim:

Fix this deadlock by allocating ff-&gt;release_args and grabbing the

the last reference on the fuse file is dropped (see fuse_file_put() -&gt;

Input: alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work

The dev3_register_work delayed work item is initialized within
alps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare
PS/2 packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS
touchpad. During device detachment, the original implementation
calls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure
completion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()
in psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that
were already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any
work items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not
included in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.
This means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,
the dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the
psmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),
the scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.

The race condition can occur as follows:

CPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)
psmouse_disconnect()     |
  psmouse_set_state()    |
  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()
  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()
    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()
                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE
                         |   priv-&gt;dev3 // USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure
that dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from
executing after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.

This bug is identified by static analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68823 | ublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68823</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table

When one process(such as udev) opens ublk block device (e.g., to read
the partition table via bdev_open()), a deadlock[1] can occur:

1. bdev_open() grabs disk-&gt;open_mutex
2. The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table
3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()
   runs bio-&gt;bi_end_io() callbacks
4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the
   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)
5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context
6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk-&gt;open_mutex again
7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds

The fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom
halves disabled. This forces blkdev_release() to run in kernel work-queue
context instead of current task work context, and allows ublk server to make
forward progress, and avoids the deadlock.

net: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources

Currently, hdev-&gt;htqp is allocated using hdev-&gt;num_tqps, and kinfo-&gt;tqp

min(new_tqps, hdev-&gt;num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo-&gt;num_tqps may be smaller

zdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com says:

The vulnerability is a race condition between `ets_qdisc_dequeue` and

Attacker requires the capability to create new user and network namespace

Comment:
This happens because some of the classes have their qdiscs assigned to
NULL, but remain in the active list. This commit fixes this issue by always
removing the class from the active list before deleting and freeing its
associated qdisc

ntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting

When mounting, sb-&gt;s_blocksize is used to read the boot_block without
being defined or validated. Set a dummy blocksize before attempting to
read the boot_block.

The issue can be triggered with the following syz reproducer:

  mkdirat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &amp;(0x7f0000000080)='./file1\x00', 0x0)
  r4 = openat$nullb(0xffffffffffffff9c, &amp;(0x7f0000000040), 0x121403, 0x0)
  ioctl$FS_IOC_SETFLAGS(r4, 0x40081271, &amp;(0x7f0000000980)=0x4000)
  mount(&amp;(0x7f0000000140)=@nullb, &amp;(0x7f0000000040)='./cgroup\x00',
        &amp;(0x7f0000000000)='ntfs3\x00', 0x2208004, 0x0)
  syz_clone(0x88200200, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)

Here, the ioctl sets the bdev block size to 16384. During mount,
get_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),
but since block_size(bdev) &gt; PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves
sb-&gt;s_blocksize at zero.

Later, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while
sb-&gt;s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.

f2fs: invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation

F2FS can mount filesystems with corrupted directory depth values that
get runtime-clamped to MAX_DIR_HASH_DEPTH. When RENAME_WHITEOUT
operations are performed on such directories, f2fs_rename performs
directory modifications (updating target entry and deleting source
entry) before attempting to add the whiteout entry via f2fs_add_link.

If f2fs_add_link fails due to the corrupted directory structure, the
function returns an error to VFS, but the partial directory
modifications have already been committed to disk. VFS assumes the
entire rename operation failed and does not update the dentry cache,
leaving stale mappings.

In the error path, VFS does not call d_move() to update the dentry
cache. This results in new_dentry still pointing to the old inode
(new_inode) which has already had its i_nlink decremented to zero.
The stale cache causes subsequent operations to incorrectly reference
the freed inode.

This causes subsequent operations to use cached dentry information that
no longer matches the on-disk state. When a second rename targets the
same entry, VFS attempts to decrement i_nlink on the stale inode, which
may already have i_nlink=0, triggering a WARNING in drop_nlink().

Example sequence:
1. First rename (RENAME_WHITEOUT): file2 → file1
   - f2fs updates file1 entry on disk (points to inode 8)
   - f2fs deletes file2 entry on disk
   - f2fs_add_link(whiteout) fails (corrupted directory)
   - Returns error to VFS
   - VFS does not call d_move() due to error
   - VFS cache still has: file1 → inode 7 (stale!)
   - inode 7 has i_nlink=0 (already decremented)

2. Second rename: file3 → file1
   - VFS uses stale cache: file1 → inode 7
   - Tries to drop_nlink on inode 7 (i_nlink already 0)
   - WARNING in drop_nlink()

Fix this by explicitly invalidating old_dentry and new_dentry when
f2fs_add_link fails during whiteout creation. This forces VFS to
refresh from disk on subsequent operations, ensuring cache consistency
even when the rename partially succeeds.

Reproducer:
1. Mount F2FS image with corrupted i_current_depth
2. renameat2(file2, file1, RENAME_WHITEOUT)
3. renameat2(file3, file1, 0)
4. System triggers WARNING in drop_nlink()</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71070 | ublk: clean up user copy references on ublk server exit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71070</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: clean up user copy references on ublk server exit

If a ublk server process releases a ublk char device file, any requests
dispatched to the ublk server but not yet completed will retain a ref
value of UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT. Before commit e63d2228ef83 ("ublk: simplify
aborting ublk request"), __ublk_fail_req() would decrement the reference
count before completing the failed request. However, that commit
optimized __ublk_fail_req() to call __ublk_complete_rq() directly
without decrementing the request reference count.
The leaked reference count incorrectly allows user copy and zero copy
operations on the completed ublk request. It also triggers the
WARN_ON_ONCE(refcount_read(&amp;amp;io-&gt;ref)) warnings in ublk_queue_reinit()
and ublk_deinit_queue().
Commit c5c5eb24ed61 ("ublk: avoid ublk_io_release() called after ublk
char dev is closed") already fixed the issue for ublk devices using
UBLK_F_SUPPORT_ZERO_COPY or UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG. However, the reference
count leak also affects UBLK_F_USER_COPY, the other reference-counted
data copy mode. Fix the condition in ublk_check_and_reset_active_ref()
to include all reference-counted data copy modes. This ensures that any
ublk requests still owned by the ublk server when it exits have their
reference counts reset to 0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71071 | iommu/mediatek: fix use-after-free on probe deferral</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71071</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: fix use-after-free on probe deferral

The driver is dropping the references taken to the larb devices during
probe after successful lookup as well as on errors. This can
potentially lead to a use-after-free in case a larb device has not yet
been bound to its driver so that the iommu driver probe defers.

Fix this by keeping the references as expected while the iommu driver is

shmem: fix recovery on rename failures

maple_tree insertions can fail if we are seriously short on memory;
simple_offset_rename() does not recover well if it runs into that.
The same goes for simple_offset_rename_exchange().

Moreover, shmem_whiteout() expects that if it succeeds, the caller will
progress to d_move(), i.e. that shmem_rename2() won't fail past the
successful call of shmem_whiteout().

Not hard to fix, fortunately - mtree_store() can't fail if the index we
are trying to store into is already present in the tree as a singleton.

For simple_offset_rename_exchange() that's enough - we just need to be
careful about the order of operations.

For simple_offset_rename() solution is to preinsert the target into the
tree for new_dir; the rest can be done without any potentially failing
operations.

That preinsertion has to be done in shmem_rename2() rather than in
simple_offset_rename() itself - otherwise we'd need to deal with the
possibility of failure after successful shmem_whiteout().</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71073 | Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71073</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device

lkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk-&gt;tq via schedule_work(), and the work
handler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its
serio/input_dev fields.

lkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd
structure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again
until serio_close() returns. This can allow the work handler to run
after the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.

Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the
reinit work cannot be re-queued, and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect()
and in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71074 | functionfs: fix the open/removal races</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71074</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

functionfs: fix the open/removal races

ffs_epfile_open() can race with removal, ending up with file-&gt;private_data
pointing to freed object.

There is a total count of opened files on functionfs (both ep0 and
dynamic ones) and when it hits zero, dynamic files get removed.
Unfortunately, that removal can happen while another thread is
in ffs_epfile_open(), but has not incremented the count yet.
In that case open will succeed, leaving us with UAF on any subsequent
read() or write().

The root cause is that ffs-&gt;opened is misused; atomic_dec_and_test() vs.
atomic_add_return() is not a good idea, when object remains visible all
along.

To untangle that
	* serialize openers on ffs-&gt;mutex (both for ep0 and for dynamic files)
	* have dynamic ones use atomic_inc_not_zero() and fail if we had
zero -&gt;opened; in that case the file we are opening is doomed.
	* have the inodes of dynamic files marked on removal (from the
callback of simple_recursive_removal()) - clear -&gt;i_private there.
	* have open of dynamic ones verify they hadn't been already removed,
along with checking that state is FFS_ACTIVE.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71075 | scsi: aic94xx: fix use-after-free in device removal path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71075</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/64s/slb: Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload

On systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that
mirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload
cache is subject to periodic eviction — typically after every 256 context
switches — to remove old entry.

To optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in
switch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.
However, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between
the hardware SLB and the software preload cache.

If an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one
CPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing
switch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the
kernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB
multi-hit error.

The following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can
cause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a
MMU context switch.

net: nfc: fix deadlock between nfc_unregister_device and rfkill_fop_write

A deadlock can occur between nfc_unregister_device() and rfkill_fop_write()
due to lock ordering inversion between device_lock and rfkill_global_mutex.

The problematic lock order is:

Thread A (rfkill_fop_write):
  rfkill_fop_write()
    mutex_lock(&amp;amp;rfkill_global_mutex)
      rfkill_set_block()
        nfc_rfkill_set_block()
          nfc_dev_down()
            device_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;dev)    &lt;- waits for device_lock

Thread B (nfc_unregister_device):
  nfc_unregister_device()
    device_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;dev)
      rfkill_unregister()
        mutex_lock(&amp;amp;rfkill_global_mutex)  &lt;- waits for rfkill_global_mutex

This creates a classic ABBA deadlock scenario.

Fix this by moving rfkill_unregister() and rfkill_destroy() outside the
device_lock critical section. Store the rfkill pointer in a local variable
before releasing the lock, then call rfkill_unregister() after releasing
device_lock.

This change is safe because rfkill_fop_write() holds rfkill_global_mutex
while calling the rfkill callbacks, and rfkill_unregister() also acquires
rfkill_global_mutex before cleanup. Therefore, rfkill_unregister() will
wait for any ongoing callback to complete before proceeding, and
device_del() is only called after rfkill_unregister() returns, preventing
any use-after-free.

The similar lock ordering in nfc_register_device() (device_lock -&gt;
rfkill_global_mutex via rfkill_register) is safe because during
registration the device is not yet in rfkill_list, so no concurrent
rfkill operations can occur on this device.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71080 | ipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71080</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route() returns NULL, the
current task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU
may then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a
pcpu_rt entry. When the first task resumes execution, its cmpxchg()
in rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu is no longer
NULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It's easy to reproduce it by adding
mdelay() after rt6_get_pcpu_route().

Using preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because
ip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.

Fix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT:
free our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by
another task. The BUG_ON is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT
kernels where such races should not occur.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71081 | ASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71081</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe

The reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing the
platform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback
fails during DAI probe.

Make sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe
deferral) and on driver unbind.

This also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever
reprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71082 | Bluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71082</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb

This reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e ("Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in
btusb.c file").

In btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This
ties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to
one interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC
and DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.

The issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling
usb_driver_release_interface(&amp;amp;btusb_driver, data-&gt;intf) will have devm
free the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of the
driver that may not be released yet.

To fix this, revert the use of devm and go back to freeing memory
explicitly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71083 | drm/ttm: Avoid NULL pointer deref for evicted BOs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71083</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()

There exists a kernel oops caused by a BUG_ON(nhead &lt; 0) at
net/core/skbuff.c:2232 in pskb_expand_head().
This bug is triggered as part of the calipso_skbuff_setattr()
routine when skb_cow() is passed headroom &gt; INT_MAX
(i.e. (int)(skb_headroom(skb) + len_delta) &lt; 0).

The root cause of the bug is due to an implicit integer cast in
__skb_cow(). The check (headroom &gt; skb_headroom(skb)) is meant to ensure
that delta = headroom - skb_headroom(skb) is never negative, otherwise
we will trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head(). However, if
headroom &gt; INT_MAX and delta &lt;= -NET_SKB_PAD, the check passes, delta
becomes negative, and pskb_expand_head() is passed a negative value for
nhead.

Fix the trigger condition in calipso_skbuff_setattr(). Avoid passing
"negative" headroom sizes to skb_cow() within calipso_skbuff_setattr()
by only using skb_cow() to grow headroom.

iavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()

There are off-by-one bugs when configuring RSS hash key and lookup
table, causing out-of-bounds reads to memory [1] and out-of-bounds
writes to device registers.

Before commit 43a3d9ba34c9 ("i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS"),
the loop upper bounds were:
    i &lt;= I40E_VFQF_{HKEY,HLUT}_MAX_INDEX
which is safe since the value is the last valid index.

That commit changed the bounds to:
    i &lt;= adapter-&gt;rss_{key,lut}_size / 4
where `rss_{key,lut}_size / 4` is the number of dwords, so the last
valid index is `(rss_{key,lut}_size / 4) - 1`. Therefore, using `&lt;=`
accesses one element past the end.

Fix the issues by using `&lt;` instead of `&lt;=`, ensuring we do not exceed
the bounds.

The TCP subflow can process the simult-connect syn-ack packet after
transitioning to TCP_FIN1 state, bypassing the MPTCP fallback check,
as the sk_state_change() callback is not invoked for * -&gt; FIN_WAIT1
transitions.

That will move the msk socket to an inconsistent status and the next
incoming data will hit the reported splat.

Close the race moving the simult-fallback check at the earliest possible
stage - that is at syn-ack generation time.

iommu: disable SVA when CONFIG_X86 is set

Patch series "Fix stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space", v7.

This proposes a fix for a security vulnerability related to IOMMU Shared
Virtual Addressing (SVA).  In an SVA context, an IOMMU can cache kernel
page table entries.  When a kernel page table page is freed and
reallocated for another purpose, the IOMMU might still hold stale,
incorrect entries.  This can be exploited to cause a use-after-free or
write-after-free condition, potentially leading to privilege escalation or
data corruption.

This solution introduces a deferred freeing mechanism for kernel page
table pages, which provides a safe window to notify the IOMMU to
invalidate its caches before the page is reused.


This patch (of 8):

In the IOMMU Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) context, the IOMMU hardware
shares and walks the CPU's page tables.  The x86 architecture maps the
kernel's virtual address space into the upper portion of every process's
page table.  Consequently, in an SVA context, the IOMMU hardware can walk
and cache kernel page table entries.

The Linux kernel currently lacks a notification mechanism for kernel page
table changes, specifically when page table pages are freed and reused. 
The IOMMU driver is only notified of changes to user virtual address
mappings.  This can cause the IOMMU's internal caches to retain stale
entries for kernel VA.

Use-After-Free (UAF) and Write-After-Free (WAF) conditions arise when
kernel page table pages are freed and later reallocated.  The IOMMU could
misinterpret the new data as valid page table entries.  The IOMMU might
then walk into attacker-controlled memory, leading to arbitrary physical
memory DMA access or privilege escalation.  This is also a
Write-After-Free issue, as the IOMMU will potentially continue to write
Accessed and Dirty bits to the freed memory while attempting to walk the
stale page tables.

Currently, SVA contexts are unprivileged and cannot access kernel
mappings.  However, the IOMMU will still walk kernel-only page tables all
the way down to the leaf entries, where it realizes the mapping is for the
kernel and errors out.  This means the IOMMU still caches these
intermediate page table entries, making the described vulnerability a real
concern.

Disable SVA on x86 architecture until the IOMMU can receive notification
to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page table pages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71090 | nfsd: fix nfsd_file reference leak in nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfsd_file reference leak in nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg()

nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg() unconditionally overwrites
fp-&gt;fi_fds[O_RDONLY] with a newly acquired nfsd_file. However, if
the client already has a SHARE_ACCESS_READ open from a previous OPEN
operation, this action overwrites the existing pointer without
releasing its reference, orphaning the previous reference.

Additionally, the function originally stored the same nfsd_file
pointer in both fp-&gt;fi_fds[O_RDONLY] and fp-&gt;fi_rdeleg_file with
only a single reference. When put_deleg_file() runs, it clears
fi_rdeleg_file and calls nfs4_file_put_access() to release the file.

However, nfs4_file_put_access() only releases fi_fds[O_RDONLY] when
the fi_access[O_RDONLY] counter drops to zero. If another READ open
exists on the file, the counter remains elevated and the nfsd_file
reference from the delegation is never released. This potentially
causes open conflicts on that file.

Then, on server shutdown, these leaks cause __nfsd_file_cache_purge()
to encounter files with an elevated reference count that cannot be
cleaned up, ultimately triggering a BUG() in kmem_cache_destroy()
because there are still nfsd_file objects allocated in that cache.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71091 | team: fix check for port enabled in team_queue_override_port_prio_changed()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()

Commit ef56081d1864 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters
update") added three new counters and placed them after
BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.

BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware
statistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.

As a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating
hw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in
bnxt_re_copy_err_stats().

The counters BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and
BNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable to generic hardware, not
only p5/p7 devices.

Fix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR so they
are included in the generic counter set.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71093 | e1000: fix OOB in e1000_tbi_should_accept()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71093</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This happens because the TBI check unconditionally dereferences the last

	u8 last_byte = *(data + length - 1);

Fix by rejecting the frame early if the length is zero, or if it exceeds
adapter-&gt;rx_buffer_len. This preserves the TBI workaround semantics for
valid frames and prevents touching memory beyond the RX buffer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71094 | net: usb: asix: validate PHY address before use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71094</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

XSK pool based xdp_buff it produces xdp_frame with memory type
MEM_TYPE_PAGE_ORDER0. However, stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() does not check the
memory type and always uses the page pool type, this leads to invalid
mappings and causes the crash. Therefore, check the xdp_buff memory type
in stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() to fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71096 | RDMA/core: Check for the presence of LS_NLA_TYPE_DGID correctly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71096</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Check for the presence of LS_NLA_TYPE_DGID correctly

The netlink response for RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE should always have a
LS_NLA_TYPE_DGID attribute, it is invalid if it does not.

Use the nl parsing logic properly and call nla_parse_deprecated() to fill
the nlattrs array and then directly index that array to get the data for
the DGID. Just fail if it is NULL.

Remove the for loop searching for the nla, and squash the validation and
parsing into one function.

Fixes an uninitialized read from the stack triggered by userspace if it
does not provide the DGID to a kernel initiated RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE
query.

ipv4: Fix reference count leak when using error routes with nexthop objects

When a nexthop object is deleted, it is marked as dead and then
fib_table_flush() is called to flush all the routes that are using the
dead nexthop.

The current logic in fib_table_flush() is to only flush error routes
(e.g., blackhole) when it is called as part of network namespace
dismantle (i.e., with flush_all=true). Therefore, error routes are not
flushed when their nexthop object is deleted:

 # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy
 # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1
 # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1
 # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1
 # ip nexthop del id 1
 # ip route show
 blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1

As such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in
turn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference
count leak:

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2

Fix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.

IPv6 does not suffer from this problem.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71098 | ip6_gre: make ip6gre_header() robust</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71098</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/oa: Fix potential UAF in xe_oa_add_config_ioctl()

In xe_oa_add_config_ioctl(), we accessed oa_config-&gt;id after dropping
metrics_lock. Since this lock protects the lifetime of oa_config, an
attacker could guess the id and call xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl() with
perfect timing, freeing oa_config before we dereference it, leading to
a potential use-after-free.

Fix this by caching the id in a local variable while holding the lock.

v2: (Matt A)
- Dropped mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;oa-&gt;metrics_lock) ordering change from
  xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl()

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix out-of-bounds array access in ACPI package parsing

The hp_populate_*_elements_from_package() functions in the hp-bioscfg
driver contain out-of-bounds array access vulnerabilities.

These functions parse ACPI packages into internal data structures using
a for loop with index variable 'elem' that iterates through
enum_obj/integer_obj/order_obj/password_obj/string_obj arrays.

When processing multi-element fields like PREREQUISITES and
ENUM_POSSIBLE_VALUES, these functions read multiple consecutive array
elements using expressions like 'enum_obj[elem + reqs]' and
'enum_obj[elem + pos_values]' within nested loops.

The bug is that the bounds check only validated elem, but did not consider
the additional offset when accessing elem + reqs or elem + pos_values.

The fix changes the bounds check to validate the actual accessed index.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:56:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36640 | Local Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36640</link><description>A vulnerability has been identified in the installation/uninstallation of the Nessus Agent Tray App on Windows Hosts which could lead to escalation of privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22755 | Remote code injection via upload_map.cgi in Legacy Vivotek Devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22755</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in Vivotek Affected device model numbers are FD8365, FD8365v2, FD9165, FD9171, FD9187, FD9189, FD9365, FD9371, FD9381, FD9387, FD9389, FD9391,FE9180,FE9181, FE9191, FE9381, FE9382, FE9391, FE9582, IB9365, IB93587LPR, IB9371,IB9381, IB9387, IB9389, IB939,IP9165,IP9171, IP9172, IP9181, IP9191, IT9389, MA9321, MA9322, MS9321, MS9390, TB9330 (Firmware modules) allows OS Command Injection.This issue affects Affected device model numbers are FD8365, FD8365v2, FD9165, FD9171, FD9187, FD9189, FD9365, FD9371, FD9381, FD9387, FD9389, FD9391,FE9180,FE9181, FE9191, FE9381, FE9382, FE9391, FE9582, IB9365, IB93587LPR, IB9371,IB9381, IB9387, IB9389, IB939,IP9165,IP9171, IP9172, IP9181, IP9191, IT9389, MA9321, MA9322, MS9321, MS9390, TB9330: 0100a, 0106a, 0106b, 0107a, 0107b_1, 0109a, 0112a, 0113a, 0113d, 0117b, 0119e, 0120b, 0121, 0121d, 0121d_48573_1, 0122e, 0124d_48573_1, 012501, 012502, 0125c.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55462 | A CORS misconfiguration in Eramba Community and Enterprise Editions v3.26.0 allows an attacker-controlled Origin header to be reflected in t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55462</link><description>A CORS misconfiguration in Eramba Community and Enterprise Editions v3.26.0 allows an attacker-controlled Origin header to be reflected in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response along with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.

The parser applies a backtracking-prone regular expression when extracting tool actions from model output. An attacker who can supply or influence the parsed text (for example via prompt injection in downstream applications that pass LLM output directly into MRKLOutputParser.parse()) can trigger excessive CPU consumption by providing a crafted payload, causing significant parsing delays and a denial-of-service condition.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 23:18:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15514 | Ollama Multi-Modal Model Image Processing NULL Pointer Dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15514</link><description>Ollama 0.11.5-rc0 through current version 0.13.5 contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the multi-modal model image processing functionality. When processing base64-encoded image data via the /api/chat endpoint, the application fails to validate that the decoded data represents valid media before passing it to the mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf function. This function can return NULL for malformed input, but the code does not check this return value before dereferencing the pointer in subsequent operations. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted base64 image data that decodes to invalid media, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the runner process. This results in a denial of service condition where the model becomes unavailable to all users until the service is restarted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 23:18:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22212 | TinyOS &amp;lt;= 2.1.2 Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in mcp2200gpio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22212</link><description>TinyOS versions up to and including 2.1.2 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the mcp2200gpio utility.

In 1.22.0 and earlier, a persistent stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the custom_hotkeys functionality of the application. An authenticated attacker (or one who can trick a user/administrator into updating their custom_hotkeys) can inject JavaScript code that executes in other users’ browsers when those users load any page using the templates/base.html template. Because the application exposes an API token endpoint (/api/current-user/token) to the browser and lacks robust CSRF protection on some API endpoints, the injected script may fetch the victim’s API token or call token reset endpoints — enabling full account takeover and unauthorized API access.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:01:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22250 | wlc can skip SSL verification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22250</link><description>wlc is a Weblate command-line client using Weblate's REST API.

Prior to 2.4.0, a vulnerability in the esp-usb UVC host implementation allows a malicious USB Video Class (UVC) device to trigger a stack buffer overflow during configuration-descriptor parsing. When UVC configuration-descriptor printing is enabled, the host prints detailed descriptor information provided by the connected USB device. A specially crafted UVC descriptor may advertise an excessively large length. Because this value is not validated before being copied into a fixed-size stack buffer, an attacker can overflow the buffer and corrupt memory.
