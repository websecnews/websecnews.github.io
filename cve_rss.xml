Prior to versions OTP-27.3.1, 26.2.5.10, and 25.3.2.19, a maliciously formed KEX init message can result with high memory usage. Implementation does not verify RFC specified limits on algorithm names (64 characters) provided in KEX init message. Big KEX init packet may lead to inefficient processing of the error data. As a result, large amount of memory will be allocated for processing malicious data. Versions OTP-27.3.1, OTP-26.2.5.10, and OTP-25.3.2.19 fix the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may set option `parallel_login` to `false` and/or reduce the `max_sessions` option.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:59:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30372 | Emlog Pro contains an SQL injection vulnerability.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30372</link><description>Emlog is an open source website building system.

Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29928 | authentik&amp;#x27;s deletion of sessions did not revoke sessions when using database session storage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29928</link><description>authentik is an open-source identity provider.

can: j1939: fix errant WARN_ON_ONCE in j1939_session_deactivate

The conclusion "j1939_session_deactivate() should be called with a
session ref-count of at least 2" is incorrect. In some concurrent
scenarios, j1939_session_deactivate can be called with the session
ref-count less than 2. But there is not any problem because it
will check the session active state before session putting in
j1939_session_deactivate_locked().

Here is the concurrent scenario of the problem reported by syzbot
and my reproduction log.

gfs2: Always check inode size of inline inodes

Check if the inode size of stuffed (inline) inodes is within the allowed
range when reading inodes from disk (gfs2_dinode_in()).  This prevents
us from on-disk corruption.

The two checks in stuffed_readpage() and gfs2_unstuffer_page() that just
truncate inline data to the maximum allowed size don't actually make

wifi: brcmfmac: Check the count value of channel spec to prevent out-of-bounds reads

This patch fixes slab-out-of-bounds reads in brcmfmac that occur in
brcmf_construct_chaninfo() and brcmf_enable_bw40_2g() when the count
value of channel specifications provided by the device is greater than
the length of 'list-&gt;element[]', decided by the size of the 'list'
allocated with kzalloc(). The patch adds checks that make the functions
free the buffer and return -EINVAL if that is the case. Note that the
negative return is handled by the caller, brcmf_setup_wiphybands() or
brcmf_cfg80211_attach().

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

mm/uffd: fix pte marker when fork() without fork event

Patch series "mm: Fixes on pte markers".

Patch 1 resolves the syzkiller report from Pengfei.

Patch 2 further harden pte markers when used with the recent swapin error
markers.  The major case is we should persist a swapin error marker after
fork(), so child shouldn't read a corrupted page.


This patch (of 2):

When fork(), dst_vma is not guaranteed to have VM_UFFD_WP even if src may
have it and has pte marker installed.  The warning is improper along with
the comment.  The right thing is to inherit the pte marker when needed, or
keep the dst pte empty.

A vague guess is this happened by an accident when there's the prior patch
to introduce src/dst vma into this helper during the uffd-wp feature got
developed and I probably messed up in the rebase, since if we replace
dst_vma with src_vma the warning &amp; comment it all makes sense too.

Hugetlb did exactly the right here (copy_hugetlb_page_range()).  Fix the
general path.

usb: gadget: f_fs: Prevent race during ffs_ep0_queue_wait

While performing fast composition switch, there is a possibility that the
process of ffs_ep0_write/ffs_ep0_read get into a race condition
due to ep0req being freed up from functionfs_unbind.

Consider the scenario that the ffs_ep0_write calls the ffs_ep0_queue_wait
by taking a lock &amp;amp;ffs-&gt;ev.waitq.lock. However, the functionfs_unbind isn't
bounded so it can go ahead and mark the ep0req to NULL, and since there
is no NULL check in ffs_ep0_queue_wait we will end up in use-after-free.

Fix this by making a serialized execution between the two functions using
a mutex_lock(ffs-&gt;mutex).</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49756 | phy: usb: sunplus: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in sp_usb_phy_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49756</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

VMCI: Use threaded irqs instead of tasklets

The vmci_dispatch_dgs() tasklet function calls vmci_read_data()

Use threaded irqs to fix this issue and completely remove usage

mm/hugetlb: fix PTE marker handling in hugetlb_change_protection()

Patch series "mm/hugetlb: uffd-wp fixes for hugetlb_change_protection()".

Playing with virtio-mem and background snapshots (using uffd-wp) on
hugetlb in QEMU, I managed to trigger a VM_BUG_ON().  Looking into the
details, hugetlb_change_protection() seems to not handle uffd-wp correctly
in all cases.

Patch #1 fixes my test case.  I don't have reproducers for patch #2, as it
requires running into migration entries.

I did not yet check in detail yet if !hugetlb code requires similar care.


This patch (of 2):

There are two problematic cases when stumbling over a PTE marker in
hugetlb_change_protection():

(1) We protect an uffd-wp PTE marker a second time using uffd-wp: we will
    end up in the "!huge_pte_none(pte)" case and mess up the PTE marker.

(2) We unprotect a uffd-wp PTE marker: we will similarly end up in the
    "!huge_pte_none(pte)" case even though we cleared the PTE, because
    the "pte" variable is stale. We'll mess up the PTE marker.

For example, if we later stumble over such a "wrongly modified" PTE marker,
we'll treat it like a present PTE that maps some garbage page.

This can, for example, be triggered by mapping a memfd backed by huge
pages, registering uffd-wp, uffd-wp'ing an unmapped page and (a)
uffd-wp'ing it a second time; or (b) uffd-unprotecting it; or (c)
unregistering uffd-wp. Then, ff we trigger fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
on that file range, we will run into a VM_BUG_ON:

btrfs: always report error in run_one_delayed_ref()

Currently we have a btrfs_debug() for run_one_delayed_ref() failure, but
if end users hit such problem, there will be no chance that
btrfs_debug() is enabled.  This can lead to very little useful info for
debugging.

This patch will:

- Add extra info for error reporting
  Including:
  * logical bytenr
  * num_bytes
  * type
  * action
  * ref_mod

- Replace the btrfs_debug() with btrfs_err()

- Move the error reporting into run_one_delayed_ref()
  This is to avoid use-after-free, the @node can be freed in the caller.

This error should only be triggered at most once.

As if run_one_delayed_ref() failed, we trigger the error message, then
causing the call chain to error out:

btrfs_run_delayed_refs()
`- btrfs_run_delayed_refs()
   `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head()
      `- run_one_delayed_ref()

And we will abort the current transaction in btrfs_run_delayed_refs().
If we have to run delayed refs for the abort transaction,
run_one_delayed_ref() will just cleanup the refs and do nothing, thus no
new error messages would be output.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52928 | bpf: Skip invalid kfunc call in backtrack_insn</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52928</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If dev_set_name() fails, we leak nvmem-&gt;wp_gpio as the cleanup does not

call, we can do better if we split device_register(), and use the
tested nvmem_release() cleanup code by initialising the device early,
and putting the device.

This results in a slightly larger fix, but results in clear code.

Squashfs: fix handling and sanity checking of xattr_ids count

A Sysbot [1] corrupted filesystem exposes two flaws in the handling and
sanity checking of the xattr_ids count in the filesystem.  Both of these
flaws cause computation overflow due to incorrect typing.

In the corrupted filesystem the xattr_ids value is 4294967071, which
stored in a signed variable becomes the negative number -225.

Flaw 1 (64-bit systems only):

The signed integer xattr_ids variable causes sign extension.

This causes variable overflow in the SQUASHFS_XATTR_*(A) macros.  The
variable is first multiplied by sizeof(struct squashfs_xattr_id) where the
type of the sizeof operator is "unsigned long".

On a 64-bit system this is 64-bits in size, and causes the negative number
to be sign extended and widened to 64-bits and then become unsigned.  This
produces the very large number 18446744073709548016 or 2^64 - 3600.  This
number when rounded up by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE - 1 (8191 bytes) and
divided by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE overflows and produces a length of 0
(stored in len).

Flaw 2 (32-bit systems only):

On a 32-bit system the integer variable is not widened by the unsigned
long type of the sizeof operator (32-bits), and the signedness of the
variable has no effect due it always being treated as unsigned.

The above corrupted xattr_ids value of 4294967071, when multiplied
overflows and produces the number 4294963696 or 2^32 - 3400.  This number
when rounded up by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE - 1 (8191 bytes) and divided by
SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE overflows again and produces a length of 0.

The effect of the 0 length computation:

In conjunction with the corrupted xattr_ids field, the filesystem also has
a corrupted xattr_table_start value, where it matches the end of
filesystem value of 850.

This causes the following sanity check code to fail because the
incorrectly computed len of 0 matches the incorrect size of the table
reported by the superblock (0 bytes).

    len = SQUASHFS_XATTR_BLOCK_BYTES(*xattr_ids);
    indexes = SQUASHFS_XATTR_BLOCKS(*xattr_ids);

    /*
     * The computed size of the index table (len bytes) should exactly
     * match the table start and end points
    */
    start = table_start + sizeof(*id_table);
    end = msblk-&gt;bytes_used;

    if (len != (end - start))
            return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

Changing the xattr_ids variable to be "usigned int" fixes the flaw on a
64-bit system.  This relies on the fact the computation is widened by the
unsigned long type of the sizeof operator.

Casting the variable to u64 in the above macro fixes this flaw on a 32-bit
system.

It also means 64-bit systems do not implicitly rely on the type of the
sizeof operator to widen the computation.

mm/MADV_COLLAPSE: catch !none !huge !bad pmd lookups

In commit 34488399fa08 ("mm/madvise: add file and shmem support to
MADV_COLLAPSE") we make the following change to find_pmd_or_thp_or_none():

	-       if (!pmd_present(pmde))
	-               return SCAN_PMD_NULL;
	+       if (pmd_none(pmde))
	+               return SCAN_PMD_NONE;

This was for-use by MADV_COLLAPSE file/shmem codepaths, where
MADV_COLLAPSE might identify a pte-mapped hugepage, only to have
khugepaged race-in, free the pte table, and clear the pmd.  Such codepaths
include:

A) If we find a suitably-aligned compound page of order HPAGE_PMD_ORDER
   already in the pagecache.
B) In retract_page_tables(), if we fail to grab mmap_lock for the target
   mm/address.

In these cases, collapse_pte_mapped_thp() really does expect a none (not
just !present) pmd, and we want to suitably identify that case separate
from the case where no pmd is found, or it's a bad-pmd (of course, many
things could happen once we drop mmap_lock, and the pmd could plausibly
undergo multiple transitions due to intervening fault, split, etc). 
Regardless, the code is prepared install a huge-pmd only when the existing
pmd entry is either a genuine pte-table-mapping-pmd, or the none-pmd.

However, the commit introduces a logical hole; namely, that we've allowed
!none- &amp;&amp; !huge- &amp;&amp; !bad-pmds to be classified as genuine
pte-table-mapping-pmds.  One such example that could leak through are swap
entries.  The pmd values aren't checked again before use in
pte_offset_map_lock(), which is expecting nothing less than a genuine
pte-table-mapping-pmd.

We want to put back the !pmd_present() check (below the pmd_none() check),
but need to be careful to deal with subtleties in pmd transitions and
treatments by various arch.

The issue is that __split_huge_pmd_locked() temporarily clears the present
bit (or otherwise marks the entry as invalid), but pmd_present() and
pmd_trans_huge() still need to return true while the pmd is in this
transitory state.  For example, x86's pmd_present() also checks the
_PAGE_PSE , riscv's version also checks the _PAGE_LEAF bit, and arm64 also
checks a PMD_PRESENT_INVALID bit.

Covering all 4 cases for x86 (all checks done on the same pmd value):

1) pmd_present() &amp;&amp; pmd_trans_huge()
   All we actually know here is that the PSE bit is set. Either:
   a) We aren't racing with __split_huge_page(), and PRESENT or PROTNONE
      is set.
      =&gt; huge-pmd
   b) We are currently racing with __split_huge_page().  The danger here
      is that we proceed as-if we have a huge-pmd, but really we are
      looking at a pte-mapping-pmd.  So, what is the risk of this
      danger?

      The only relevant path is:

	madvise_collapse() -&gt; collapse_pte_mapped_thp()

      Where we might just incorrectly report back "success", when really
      the memory isn't pmd-backed.  This is fine, since split could
      happen immediately after (actually) successful madvise_collapse().
      So, it should be safe to just assume huge-pmd here.

2) pmd_present() &amp;&amp; !pmd_trans_huge()
   Either:
   a) PSE not set and either PRESENT or PROTNONE is.
      =&gt; pte-table-mapping pmd (or PROT_NONE)
   b) devmap.  This routine can be called immediately after
      unlocking/locking mmap_lock -- or called with no locks held (see
      khugepaged_scan_mm_slot()), so previous VMA checks have since been
      invalidated.

3) !pmd_present() &amp;&amp; pmd_trans_huge()
  Not possible.

4) !pmd_present() &amp;&amp; !pmd_trans_huge()
  Neither PRESENT nor PROTNONE set
  =&gt; not present

I've checked all archs that implement pmd_trans_huge() (arm64, riscv,
powerpc, longarch, x86, mips, s390) and this logic roughly translates
(though devmap treatment is unique to x86 and powerpc, and (3) doesn't
necessarily hold in general -- but that doesn't matter since
!pmd_present() always takes failure path).

Also, add a comment above find_pmd_or_thp_or_none()

mm/khugepaged: fix -&gt;anon_vma race

If an -&gt;anon_vma is attached to the VMA, collapse_and_free_pmd() requires
it to be locked.

Page table traversal is allowed under any one of the mmap lock, the
anon_vma lock (if the VMA is associated with an anon_vma), and the
mapping lock (if the VMA is associated with a mapping); and so to be
able to remove page tables, we must hold all three of them. 
retract_page_tables() bails out if an -&gt;anon_vma is attached, but does
this check before holding the mmap lock (as the comment above the check
explains).

If we racily merged an existing -&gt;anon_vma (shared with a child
process) from a neighboring VMA, subsequent rmap traversals on pages
belonging to the child will be able to see the page tables that we are
concurrently removing while assuming that nothing else can access them.

Repeat the -&gt;anon_vma check once we hold the mmap lock to ensure that
there really is no concurrent page table access.

Hitting this bug causes a lockdep warning in collapse_and_free_pmd(),
in the line "lockdep_assert_held_write(&amp;amp;vma-&gt;anon_vma-&gt;root-&gt;rwsem)". 
It can also lead to use-after-free access.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52936 | kernel/irq/irqdomain.c: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52936</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The former 'txtimer' function is split into 'txfrtimer' and 'txtimer'

session we will hit a use after free bug.

Set the tcp_sw_host-&gt;session after we have completed session creation and

block: ublk: extending queue_size to fix overflow

When validating drafted SPDK ublk target, in a case that
assigning large queue depth to multiqueue ublk device,
ublk target would run into a weird incorrect state. During
rounds of review and debug, An overflow bug was found
in ublk driver.

In ublk_cmd.h, UBLK_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH is 4096 which means
each ublk queue depth can be set as large as 4096. But
when setting qd for a ublk device,
sizeof(struct ublk_queue) + depth * sizeof(struct ublk_io)
will be larger than 65535 if qd is larger than 2728.
Then queue_size is overflowed, and ublk_get_queue()
references a wrong pointer position. The wrong content of
ublk_queue elements will lead to out-of-bounds memory
access.

Extend queue_size in ublk_device as "unsigned int".</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52981 | drm/i915: Fix request ref counting during error capture &amp;amp; debugfs dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52981</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix request ref counting during error capture &amp; debugfs dump

When GuC support was added to error capture, the reference counting
around the request object was broken. Fix it up.

The context based search manages the spinlocking around the search
internally. So it needs to grab the reference count internally as
well. The execlist only request based search relies on external
locking, so it needs an external reference count but within the
spinlock not outside it.

The only other caller of the context based search is the code for
dumping engine state to debugfs. That code wasn't previously getting
an explicit reference at all as it does everything while holding the
execlist specific spinlock. So, that needs updaing as well as that
spinlock doesn't help when using GuC submission. Rather than trying to
conditionally get/put depending on submission model, just change it to
always do the get/put.

v2: Explicitly document adding an extra blank line in some dense code
(Andy Shevchenko). Fix multiple potential null pointer derefs in case
of no request found (some spotted by Tvrtko, but there was more!).
Also fix a leaked request in case of !started and another in
__guc_reset_context now that intel_context_find_active_request is
actually reference counting the returned request.
v3: Add a _get suffix to intel_context_find_active_request now that it
grabs a reference (Daniele).
v4: Split the intel_guc_find_hung_context change to a separate patch
and rename intel_context_find_active_request_get to
intel_context_get_active_request (Tvrtko).
v5: s/locking/reference counting/ in commit message (Tvrtko)

fscache: Use wait_on_bit() to wait for the freeing of relinquished volume

The freeing of relinquished volume will wake up the pending volume
acquisition by using wake_up_bit(), however it is mismatched with
wait_var_event() used in fscache_wait_on_volume_collision() and it will
never wake up the waiter in the wait-queue because these two functions
operate on different wait-queues.

According to the implementation in fscache_wait_on_volume_collision(),
if the wake-up of pending acquisition is delayed longer than 20 seconds
(e.g., due to the delay of on-demand fd closing), the first
wait_var_event_timeout() will timeout and the following wait_var_event()
will hang forever as shown below:

Considering that wake_up_bit() is more selective, so fix it by using
wait_on_bit() instead of wait_var_event() to wait for the freeing of
relinquished volume. In addition because waitqueue_active() is used in
wake_up_bit() and clear_bit() doesn't imply any memory barrier, use
clear_and_wake_up_bit() to add the missing memory barrier between
cursor-&gt;flags and waitqueue_active().</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52983 | block, bfq: fix uaf for bfqq in bic_set_bfqq()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52983</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Check for any of tcp_bpf_prots when cloning a listener

A listening socket linked to a sockmap has its sk_prot overridden. It
points to one of the struct proto variants in tcp_bpf_prots. The variant
depends on the socket's family and which sockmap programs are attached.

A child socket cloned from a TCP listener initially inherits their sk_prot.
But before cloning is finished, we restore the child's proto to the
listener's original non-tcp_bpf_prots one. This happens in
tcp_create_openreq_child -&gt; tcp_bpf_clone.

Today, in tcp_bpf_clone we detect if the child's proto should be restored
by checking only for the TCP_BPF_BASE proto variant. This is not
correct. The sk_prot of listening socket linked to a sockmap can point to
to any variant in tcp_bpf_prots.

If the listeners sk_prot happens to be not the TCP_BPF_BASE variant, then
the child socket unintentionally is left if the inherited sk_prot by
tcp_bpf_clone.

This leads to issues like infinite recursion on close [1], because the
child state is otherwise not set up for use with tcp_bpf_prot operations.

Adjust the check in tcp_bpf_clone to detect all of tcp_bpf_prots variants.

Note that it wouldn't be sufficient to check the socket state when
overriding the sk_prot in tcp_bpf_update_proto in order to always use the
TCP_BPF_BASE variant for listening sockets. Since commit
b8b8315e39ff ("bpf, sockmap: Remove unhash handler for BPF sockmap usage")
it is possible for a socket to transition to TCP_LISTEN state while already
linked to a sockmap, e.g. connect() -&gt; insert into map -&gt;
connect(AF_UNSPEC) -&gt; listen().

firewire: fix memory leak for payload of request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region

This patch is fix for Linux kernel v2.6.33 or later.

For request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region, Linux FireWire subsystem
have had an issue of use-after-free. The subsystem allows multiple
user space listeners to the region, while data of the payload was likely
released before the listeners execute read(2) to access to it for copying
to user space.

The issue was fixed by a commit 281e20323ab7 ("firewire: core: fix
use-after-free regression in FCP handler"). The object of payload is
duplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes
ioctl(2) with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request, the object is going to
be released.

However, it causes memory leak since the commit relies on call of
release_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c. Against the
expectation, the function is never called due to the design of
release_client_resource(). The function delegates release task
to caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The implementation
of ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object
explicitly.

This commit fixes the bug.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52990 | s390: workaround invalid gcc-11 out of bounds read warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52990</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390: workaround invalid gcc-11 out of bounds read warning

GCC 11.1.0 and 11.2.0 generate a wrong warning when compiling the
kernel e.g. with allmodconfig:

arch/s390/kernel/setup.c: In function ‘setup_lowcore_dat_on’:
./include/linux/fortify-string.h:57:33: error: ‘__builtin_memcpy’ reading 128 bytes from a region of size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overread]

  526 |         memcpy(abs_lc-&gt;cregs_save_area, S390_lowcore.cregs_save_area,
      |         ^~~~~~

This could be addressed by using absolute_pointer() with the
S390_lowcore macro, but this is not a good idea since this generates
worse code for performance critical paths.

Therefore simply use a for loop to copy the array in question and get
rid of the warning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52991 | net: fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52991</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list

Commit 3a1296a38d0c ("net: Support GRO/GSO fraglist chaining.")
introduced UDP listifyed GRO. The segmentation relies on frag_list being
untouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be
broken sometimes, where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area,
leaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger
following NULL pointer dereference, and panic the kernel. Reverse the

x86/i8259: Mark legacy PIC interrupts with IRQ_LEVEL

Baoquan reported that after triggering a crash the subsequent crash-kernel
fails to boot about half of the time. It triggers a NULL pointer
dereference in the periodic tick code.

This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in
software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context
get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference.

The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector
which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is
enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level
triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing
ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not
know about their trigger type.

Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52994 | acpi: Fix suspend with Xen PV</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52994</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix UaF in netns ops registration error path

If net_assign_generic() fails, the current error path in ops_init() tries
to clear the gen pointer slot. Anyway, in such error path, the gen pointer
itself has not been modified yet, and the existing and accessed one is
smaller than the accessed index, causing an out-of-bounds error:

netlink: prevent potential spectre v1 gadgets

Most netlink attributes are parsed and validated from
__nla_validate_parse() or validate_nla()

    u16 type = nla_type(nla);

    if (type == 0 || type &gt; maxtype) {

@type is then used as an array index and can be used
as a Spectre v1 gadget.

array_index_nospec() can be used to prevent leaking
content of kernel memory to malicious users.

This should take care of vast majority of netlink uses,
but an audit is needed to take care of others where
validation is not yet centralized in core netlink functions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53001 | drm/drm_vma_manager: Add drm_vma_node_allow_once()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53001</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Make sure trace_printk() can output as soon as it can be used

Currently trace_printk() can be used as soon as early_trace_init() is
called from start_kernel(). But if a crash happens, and
"ftrace_dump_on_oops" is set on the kernel command line, all you get will
be:

  [    0.456075]   -0         0dN.2. 347519us : Unknown type 6
  [    0.456075]   -0         0dN.2. 353141us : Unknown type 6
  [    0.456075]   -0         0dN.2. 358684us : Unknown type 6

This is because the trace_printk() event (type 6) hasn't been registered
yet. That gets done via an early_initcall(), which may be early, but not
early enough.

Instead of registering the trace_printk() event (and other ftrace events,
which are not trace events) via an early_initcall(), have them registered at
the same time that trace_printk() can be used. This way, if there is a
crash before early_initcall(), then the trace_printk()s will actually be
useful.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53008 | cifs: fix potential memory leaks in session setup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: enable all safety features by default

In the original implementation of dwmac5
commit 8bf993a5877e ("net: stmmac: Add support for DWMAC5 and implement Safety Features")
all safety features were enabled by default.

Later it seems some implementations didn't have support for all the
features, so in
commit 5ac712dcdfef ("net: stmmac: enable platform specific safety features")
the safety_feat_cfg structure was added to the callback and defined for
some platforms to selectively enable these safety features.

The problem is that only certain platforms were given that software
support. If the automotive safety package bit is set in the hardware
features register the safety feature callback is called for the platform,
and for platforms that didn't get a safety_feat_cfg defined this results
in the following NULL pointer dereference:

Bluetooth: Fix possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change

syzbot reports a possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change [1].
While rfcomm_sock_connect acquires the sk lock and waits for
the rfcomm lock, rfcomm_sock_release could have the rfcomm
lock and hit a deadlock for acquiring the sk lock.
Here's a simplified flow:

rfcomm_sock_connect:
  lock_sock(sk)
  rfcomm_dlc_open:
    rfcomm_lock()

rfcomm_sock_release:
  rfcomm_sock_shutdown:
    rfcomm_lock()
    __rfcomm_dlc_close:
        rfcomm_k_state_change:
	  lock_sock(sk)

This patch drops the sk lock before calling rfcomm_dlc_open to
avoid the possible deadlock and holds sk's reference count to
prevent use-after-free after rfcomm_dlc_open completes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53017 | Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix memory leak in hci_update_adv_data()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53017</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_taprio: fix possible use-after-free

syzbot reported a nasty crash [1] in net_tx_action() which
made little sense until we got a repro.

This repro installs a taprio qdisc, but providing an
invalid TCA_RATE attribute.

qdisc_create() has to destroy the just initialized
taprio qdisc, and taprio_destroy() is called.

However, the hrtimer used by taprio had already fired,
therefore advance_sched() called __netif_schedule().

Then net_tx_action was trying to use a destroyed qdisc.

We can not undo the __netif_schedule(), so we must wait
until one cpu serviced the qdisc before we can proceed.

Many thanks to Alexander Potapenko for his help.

but I'll say it anyway: the enetc_tx_onestep_tstamp() work item runs in
process context, therefore with softirqs enabled (i.o.w., it can be
interrupted by a softirq). If we hold the netif_tx_lock() when there is
an interrupt, and the NET_TX softirq then gets scheduled, this will take
the netif_tx_lock() a second time and deadlock the kernel.

To solve this, use netif_tx_lock_bh(), which blocks softirqs from
running.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53023 | net: nfc: Fix use-after-free in local_cleanup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53023</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: nfc: Fix use-after-free in local_cleanup()

Fix a use-after-free that occurs in kfree_skb() called from
local_cleanup(). This could happen when killing nfc daemon (e.g. neard)
after detaching an nfc device.
When detaching an nfc device, local_cleanup() called from
nfc_llcp_unregister_device() frees local-&gt;rx_pending and decreases
local-&gt;ref by kref_put() in nfc_llcp_local_put().
In the terminating process, nfc daemon releases all sockets and it leads
to decreasing local-&gt;ref. After the last release of local-&gt;ref,
local_cleanup() called from local_release() frees local-&gt;rx_pending
again, which leads to the bug.

Setting local-&gt;rx_pending to NULL in local_cleanup() could prevent
use-after-free when local_cleanup() is called twice.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

bpf: Fix pointer-leak due to insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation

To mitigate Spectre v4, 2039f26f3aca ("bpf: Fix leakage due to
insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation") inserts lfence
instructions after 1) initializing a stack slot and 2) spilling a
pointer to the stack.

However, this does not cover cases where a stack slot is first
initialized with a pointer (subject to sanitization) but then
overwritten with a scalar (not subject to sanitization because
the slot was already initialized). In this case, the second write
may be subject to speculative store bypass (SSB) creating a
speculative pointer-as-scalar type confusion. This allows the
program to subsequently leak the numerical pointer value using,
for example, a branch-based cache side channel.

To fix this, also sanitize scalars if they write a stack slot
that previously contained a pointer. Assuming that pointer-spills
are only generated by LLVM on register-pressure, the performance
impact on most real-world BPF programs should be small.

The following unprivileged BPF bytecode drafts a minimal exploit
and the mitigation:

  [...]
  // r6 = 0 or 1 (skalar, unknown user input)
  // r7 = accessible ptr for side channel
  // r10 = frame pointer (fp), to be leaked
  //
  r9 = r10 # fp alias to encourage ssb
  *(u64 *)(r9 - 8) = r10 // fp[-8] = ptr, to be leaked
  // lfence added here because of pointer spill to stack.
  //
  // Ommitted: Dummy bpf_ringbuf_output() here to train alias predictor
  // for no r9-r10 dependency.
  //
  *(u64 *)(r10 - 8) = r6 // fp[-8] = scalar, overwrites ptr
  // 2039f26f3aca: no lfence added because stack slot was not STACK_INVALID,
  // store may be subject to SSB
  //
  // fix: also add an lfence when the slot contained a ptr
  //
  r8 = *(u64 *)(r9 - 8)
  // r8 = architecturally a scalar, speculatively a ptr
  //
  // leak ptr using branch-based cache side channel:
  r8 &amp;= 1 // choose bit to leak
  if r8 == 0 goto SLOW // no mispredict
  // architecturally dead code if input r6 is 0,
  // only executes speculatively iff ptr bit is 1
  r8 = *(u64 *)(r7 + 0) # encode bit in cache (0: slow, 1: fast)
SLOW:
  [...]

After running this, the program can time the access to *(r7 + 0) to
determine whether the chosen pointer bit was 0 or 1. Repeat this 64
times to recover the whole address on amd64.

In summary, sanitization can only be skipped if one scalar is
overwritten with another scalar. Scalar-confusion due to speculative
store bypass can not lead to invalid accesses because the pointer
bounds deducted during verification are enforced using branchless
logic. See 979d63d50c0c ("bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on
pointer arithmetic") for details.

Do not make the mitigation depend on !env-&gt;allow_{uninit_stack,ptr_leaks}
because speculative leaks are likely unexpected if these were enabled.
For example, leaking the address to a protected log file may be acceptable
while disabling the mitigation might unintentionally leak the address
into the cached-state of a map that is accessible to unprivileged
processes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53025 | NFSD: fix use-after-free in nfsd4_ssc_setup_dul()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53025</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If signal_pending() returns true, schedule_timeout() will not be executed,
causing the waiting task to remain in the wait queue.
Fixed by adding a call to finish_wait(), which ensures that the waiting
task will always be removed from the wait queue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53026 | RDMA/core: Fix ib block iterator counter overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53026</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Fix ib block iterator counter overflow

When registering a new DMA MR after selecting the best aligned page size
for it, we iterate over the given sglist to split each entry to smaller,
aligned to the selected page size, DMA blocks.

In given circumstances where the sg entry and page size fit certain
sizes and the sg entry is not aligned to the selected page size, the
total size of the aligned pages we need to cover the sg entry is &gt;= 4GB.
Under this circumstances, while iterating page aligned blocks, the
counter responsible for counting how much we advanced from the start of
the sg entry is overflowed because its type is u32 and we pass 4GB in
size. This can lead to an infinite loop inside the iterator function
because the overflow prevents the counter to be larger
than the size of the sg entry.

Fix the presented problem by changing the advancement condition to
eliminate overflow.

octeontx2-pf: Fix the use of GFP_KERNEL in atomic context on rt

The commit 4af1b64f80fb ("octeontx2-pf: Fix lmtst ID used in aura
free") uses the get/put_cpu() to protect the usage of percpu pointer
in -&gt;aura_freeptr() callback, but it also unnecessarily disable the
preemption for the blockable memory allocation. The commit 87b93b678e95
("octeontx2-pf: Avoid use of GFP_KERNEL in atomic context") tried to
fix these sleep inside atomic warnings. But it only fix the one for
the non-rt kernel. For the rt kernel, we still get the similar warnings
like below.

Of course, we can shuffle the get/put_cpu() to only wrap the invocation
of -&gt;aura_freeptr() as what commit 87b93b678e95 does. But there are only
two -&gt;aura_freeptr() callbacks, otx2_aura_freeptr() and
cn10k_aura_freeptr(). There is no usage of perpcu variable in the
otx2_aura_freeptr() at all, so the get/put_cpu() seems redundant to it.
We can move the get/put_cpu() into the corresponding callback which
really has the percpu variable usage and avoid the sprinkling of
get/put_cpu() in several places.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:55:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53030 | octeontx2-pf: Avoid use of GFP_KERNEL in atomic context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53030</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The above warning triggered because the current imc-pmu code uses mutex
lock in interrupt disabled sections. The function mutex_lock()
internally calls __might_resched(), which will check if IRQs are
disabled and in case IRQs are disabled, it will trigger the warning.

Fix the issue by changing the mutex lock to spinlock.

netfilter: ipset: Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function.

When first_ip is 0, last_ip is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of
an arithmetic expression 2 &lt;&lt; (netmask - mask_bits - 1) is subject
to overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type
before performing the arithmetic.

Note that it's harmless since the value will be checked at the next step.

sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled

David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:

  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220
   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180
   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250
   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

The corresponding interrupt flag trace:

  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90
  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90

That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further
instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec
jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the
NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked
cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:

  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60
  down_timeout+0x18/0x60
  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80
  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100

  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0
  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240
  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with
the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the
scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and
invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler
enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above
warning at the end.

Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in
triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not
have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations
it's just a question of time.

The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling
models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and
the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into
account.

Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58091 | drm/fbdev-dma: Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/fbdev-dma: Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O

DMA areas are not necessarily backed by struct page, so we cannot
rely on it for deferred I/O. Allocate a shadow buffer for drivers
that require deferred I/O and use it as framebuffer memory.

Fixes driver errors about being "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address" or "Unable to handle kernel paging
request at virtual address".

The patch splits drm_fbdev_dma_driver_fbdev_probe() in an initial
allocation, which creates the DMA-backed buffer object, and a tail
that sets up the fbdev data structures. There is a tail function for
direct memory mappings and a tail function for deferred I/O with
the shadow buffer.

It is no longer possible to use deferred I/O without shadow buffer.
It can be re-added if there exists a reliably test for usable struct
page in the allocated DMA-backed buffer object.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21872 | efi: Don&amp;#x27;t map the entire mokvar table to determine its size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21872</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: Don't map the entire mokvar table to determine its size

Currently, when validating the mokvar table, we (re)map the entire table
on each iteration of the loop, adding space as we discover new entries.
If the table grows over a certain size, this fails due to limitations of
early_memmap(), and we get a failure and traceback:

  mokvar: Failed to map EFI MOKvar config table pa=0x7c4c3000, size=265187.

Mapping the entire structure isn't actually necessary, as we don't ever
need more than one entry header mapped at once.

Changes efi_mokvar_table_init() to only map each entry header, not the
entire table, when determining the table size.  Since we're not mapping
any data past the variable name, it also changes the code to enforce
that each variable name is NUL terminated, rather than attempting to
verify it in place.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21873 | scsi: ufs: core: bsg: Fix crash when arpmb command fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21873</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero.

Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,
which should be done only if the journal is configured.

Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS.

This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to
compiler optimization.

On my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following:

Indeed the PM can try to send a RM_ADDR over a msk without acquiring
first the msk socket lock.

The bugged code-path comes from an early optimization: when there
are no subflows, the PM should (usually) not send RM_ADDR
notifications.

The above statement is incorrect, as without locks another process
could concur

iommu/vt-d: Fix suspicious RCU usage

Commit  ("iommu/vt-d: Allocate DMAR fault interrupts
locally") moved the call to enable_drhd_fault_handling() to a code
path that does not hold any lock while traversing the drhd list. Fix
it by ensuring the dmar_global_lock lock is held when traversing the
drhd list.

Without this fix, the following warning is triggered:

Holding the lock in enable_drhd_fault_handling() triggers a lockdep splat
about a possible deadlock between dmar_global_lock and cpu_hotplug_lock.
This is avoided by not holding dmar_global_lock when calling
iommu_device_register(), which initiates the device probe process.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21877 | usbnet: gl620a: fix endpoint checking in genelink_bind()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21877</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: gl620a: fix endpoint checking in genelink_bind()

Syzbot reports [1] a warning in usb_submit_urb() triggered by
inconsistencies between expected and actually present endpoints
in gl620a driver. Since genelink_bind() does not properly
verify whether specified eps are in fact provided by the device,
in this case, an artificially manufactured one, one may get a
mismatch.

Fix the issue by resorting to a usbnet utility function
usbnet_get_endpoints(), usually reserved for this very problem.
Check for endpoints and return early before proceeding further if
any are missing.

i2c: npcm: disable interrupt enable bit before devm_request_irq

The customer reports that there is a soft lockup issue related to
the i2c driver. After checking, the i2c module was doing a tx transfer
and the bmc machine reboots in the middle of the i2c transaction, the i2c
module keeps the status without being reset.

Due to such an i2c module status, the i2c irq handler keeps getting
triggered since the i2c irq handler is registered in the kernel booting
process after the bmc machine is doing a warm rebooting.
The continuous triggering is stopped by the soft lockup watchdog timer.

Disable the interrupt enable bit in the i2c module before calling
devm_request_irq to fix this issue since the i2c relative status bit
is read-only.

Here is the soft lockup log.

btrfs: fix use-after-free on inode when scanning root during em shrinking

At btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the inode's root (and fs_info) in a
call to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode for a delayed
iput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the
cleaner kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call
to btrfs_fs_closing().

Fix this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead
of doing inode-&gt;root-&gt;fs_info.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21880 | drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21880</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling

Currently we treat EFAULT from hmm_range_fault() as a non-fatal error
when called from xe_vm_userptr_pin() with the idea that we want to avoid
killing the entire vm and chucking an error, under the assumption that
the user just did an unmap or something, and has no intention of
actually touching that memory from the GPU.  At this point we have
already zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and
if the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.

However it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on
the rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the
pin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the
rebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and
this time hitting the EFAULT.

This explains an internal user report of hitting:

Followed by NPD, when running some workload, since the sg was never
actually populated but the vma is still marked for rebind when it should
be skipped for this special EFAULT case. This is confirmed to fix the
user report.

v2 (MattB):
 - Move earlier.
v3 (MattB):
 - Update the commit message to make it clear that this indeed fixes the
   issue.

The cause is that zero pfn is set to the PTE without increasing the RSS
count in mfill_atomic_pte_zeropage() and the refcount of zero folio does
not increase accordingly. Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed
in uprobe_write_opcode()-&gt;__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the
RSS count and old_folio's refcount.

Therefore, two bugs are introduced:

 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report
    error "Bad rss-count".

 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio-&gt;refcount is zero,
    then free_pages_prepare-&gt;free_page_is_bad() report error
    "Bad page state".

There is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:

  __replace_page()
    -&gt; ...
      -&gt; folio_remove_rmap_pte()
        -&gt; VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)

Considering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just
reject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().

ice: Fix deinitializing VF in error path

If ice_ena_vfs() fails after calling ice_create_vf_entries(), it frees
all VFs without removing them from snapshot PF-VF mailbox list, leading
to list corruption.

Reproducer:

  sleep 1
  echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/net/$PF1/device/sriov_numvfs

net: better track kernel sockets lifetime

While kernel sockets are dismantled during pernet_operations-&gt;exit(),
their freeing can be delayed by any tx packets still held in qdisc
or device queues, due to skb_set_owner_w() prior calls.

This then trigger the following warning from ref_tracker_dir_exit() [1]

To fix this, make sure that kernel sockets own a reference on net-&gt;passive.

Add sk_net_refcnt_upgrade() helper, used whenever a kernel socket
is converted to a refcounted one.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix implicit ODP hang on parent deregistration

Fix the destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr() to prevent hanging during
parent deregistration as of below [1].

Upon entering destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr(), the reference count
for the implicit MR parent is incremented using:
refcount_inc_not_zero().

A corresponding decrement must be performed if
free_implicit_child_mr_work() is not called.

The code has been updated to properly manage the reference count that
was incremented.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a WARN during dereg_mr for DM type

Memory regions (MR) of type DM (device memory) do not have an associated
umem.

In the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() -&gt; mlx5_free_priv_descs() flow, the code
incorrectly takes the wrong branch, attempting to call
dma_unmap_single() on a DMA address that is not mapped.

This results in a WARN [1], as shown below.

The issue is resolved by properly accounting for the DM type and
ensuring the correct branch is selected in mlx5_free_priv_descs().

RDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP

This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP,
ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].

During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the
software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.

Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed
CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB
specification.

This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.

To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a
barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.

Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no
outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and
subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.

Note:
For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR.
Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive
IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't
care about its status.

A class pollution vulnerability in Mesop prior to version 0.14.1 allows attackers to overwrite global variables and class attributes in certain Mesop modules during runtime. This vulnerability could directly lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack against the server. Additionally, it could also result in other severe consequences given the application's implementation, such as identity confusion, where an attacker could impersonate an assistant or system role within conversations. This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak attacks when interacting with large language models (LLMs). Just like the Javascript's prototype pollution, this vulnerability could leave a way for attackers to manipulate the intended data-flow or control-flow of the application at runtime and lead to severe consequences like remote code execution when gadgets are available. Users should upgrade to version 0.14.1 to obtain a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1997 | IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) / IBM DevOps Deploy HTML injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1997</link><description>IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) 7.0 through 7.0.5.25, 7.1 through 7.1.2.21, 7.2 through 7.2.3.14, and 7.3 through 7.3.2.0 / IBM DevOps Deploy 8.0 through 8.0.1.4 and 8.1 through 8.1 could allow unauthorized access to other services or potential exposure of sensitive data due to missing authentication in its Agent Relay service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:49:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1998 | IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) / IBM DevOps Deploy information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1998</link><description>IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) through 7.1.2.21, 7.2 through 7.2.3.14, and 7.3 through 7.3.2.0 / IBM DevOps Deploy 8.0 through 8.0.1.4 and 8.1 through 8.1

bpf, test_run: Fix use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()

KMSAN reported a use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()[1]. The
cause of the issue was that eth_skb_pkt_type() accessed skb's data
that didn't contain an Ethernet header. This occurs when
bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() passes an invalid value as the user_data
argument to bpf_test_init().

Fix this by returning an error when user_data is less than ETH_HLEN in
bpf_test_init(). Additionally, remove the check for "if (user_size &gt;
size)" as it is unnecessary.

on kernel built with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45, where SKB_WITH_OVERHEAD(1024)
is smaller than GRO_MAX_HEAD.

Such built additionally contains the revert of the single page frag cache
so that napi_get_frags() ends up using the page frag allocator, triggering
the splat.

Note that the underlying issue is independent from the mentioned
revert; address it ensuring that the small head cache will fit either TCP
and GRO allocation and updating napi_alloc_skb() and __netdev_alloc_skb()
to select kmalloc() usage for any allocation fitting such cache.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21869 | powerpc/code-patching: Disable KASAN report during patching via temporary mm</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21869</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit c28c15b6d28a ("powerpc/code-patching: Use temporary mm for
Radix MMU") is inspired from x86 but unlike x86 is doesn't disable
KASAN reports during patching. This wasn't a problem at the begining
because __patch_mem() is not instrumented.

Commit 465cabc97b42 ("powerpc/code-patching: introduce
patch_instructions()") use copy_to_kernel_nofault() to copy several
instructions at once. But when using temporary mm the destination is
not regular kernel memory but a kind of kernel-like memory located
in user address space.

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Other, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as
the ALH copier and in that case the copier-&gt;data is NULL, no alh_data is
attached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.
We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()
and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()
will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.

The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the
1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w-&gt;private is valid
2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21871 | tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop

OP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it
be hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an OP-TEE
RPC call. It becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdown
ordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the
client application.

Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client
getting hung in an unkillable state. It in turn lead to system being in
hung up state requiring hard power off/on to recover.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2849 | UPX p_lx_elf.cpp un_DT_INIT heap-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2849</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in UPX up to 5.0.0.
