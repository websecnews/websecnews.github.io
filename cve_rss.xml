Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 14:29:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35654 | WordPress Responsive theme &amp;lt;= 5.0.3 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35654</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in CyberChimps Responsive allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Responsive: from n/a through 5.0.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 14:12:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35655 | WordPress Brave â Interactive Content plugin &amp;lt;= 0.6.8 -

Exfiltration in gradio-app/gradio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4254</link><description>The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49852 | WordPress Responsive Slick Slider WordPress plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4 - Content Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49852</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) vulnerability in Vsourz Digital Responsive Slick Slider WordPress allows Code Injection.This issue affects Responsive Slick Slider WordPress: from n/a through 1.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37052 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37052</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded scikit-learn model to run arbitrary code on an end userâs system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37053 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37053</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded scikit-learn model to run arbitrary code on an end userâs system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37054 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 0.9.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37054</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 0.9.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded PyFunc model to run arbitrary code on an end userâs system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49774 | WordPress WP Photo Album Plus plugin &amp;lt;= 8.5.02.005 - IP Bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49774</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in J.N.

When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore.

thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug

With the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code,
user space can open the "mitigations" file for a thermal zone before
the zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer
dereference in tze_seq_start().

Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal
zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing
the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may clear
tz-&gt;debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the
struct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.

To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's
struct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in
thermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(),
tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s-&gt;private
instead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensure
that tz_debugfs will be valid across the "mitigations" file accesses
until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove()
removes that file.

To address the second problem, use tz-&gt;lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove()
around the tz-&gt;debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is
removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

net: ks8851: Queue RX packets in IRQ handler instead of disabling BHs

Currently the driver uses local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() in its
IRQ handler to avoid triggering net_rx_action() softirq on exit from
netif_rx(). The net_rx_action() could trigger this driver .start_xmit
callback, which is protected by the same lock as the IRQ handler, so
calling the .start_xmit from netif_rx() from the IRQ handler critical
section protected by the lock could lead to an attempt to claim the
already claimed lock, and a hang.

The local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() approach works only in case
the IRQ handler is protected by a spinlock, but does not work if the
IRQ handler is protected by mutex, i.e. this works for KS8851 with
Parallel bus interface, but not for KS8851 with SPI bus interface.

Remove the BH manipulation and instead of calling netif_rx() inside
the IRQ handler code protected by the lock, queue all the received
SKBs in the IRQ handler into a queue first, and once the IRQ handler
exits the critical section protected by the lock, dequeue all the
queued SKBs and push them all into netif_rx(). At this point, it is
safe to trigger the net_rx_action() softirq, since the netif_rx()
call is outside of the lock that protects the IRQ handler.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:52:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36963 | tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36963</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options

There's an inconsistency with the way permissions are handled in tracefs.
Because the permissions are generated when accessed, they default to the
root inode's permission if they were never set by the user. If the user
sets the permissions, then a flag is set and the permissions are saved via
the inode (for tracefs files) or an internal attribute field (for
eventfs).

But if a remount happens that specify the permissions, all the files that
were not changed by the user gets updated, but the ones that were are not.
If the user were to remount the file system with a given permission, then
all files and directories within that file system should be updated.

This can cause security issues if a file's permission was updated but the
admin forgot about it. They could incorrectly think that remounting with
permissions set would update all files, but miss some.

For example:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # chgrp 1002 current_tracer
 # ls -l
[..]
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp  0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Where current_tracer now has group "lkp".

 # mount -o remount,gid=1001 .
 # ls -l
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp     0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Everything changed but the "current_tracer".

Add a new link list that keeps track of all the tracefs_inodes which has
the permission flags that tell if the file/dir should use the root inode's
permission or not. Then on remount, clear all the flags so that the
default behavior of using the root inode's permission is done for all
files and directories.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 07:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36964 | fs/9p: only translate RWX permissions for plain 9P2000</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36964</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Garbage in plain 9P2000's perm bits is allowed through, which causes it
