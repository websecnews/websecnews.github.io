To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious actor must have a valid user account with administrative access to the Management Console. If successful, the actor could inject persistent JavaScript payloads, enabling the theft of user data or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of other users.

While this issue enables persistent client-side script execution, session-related cookies remain protected with the httpOnly flag, preventing session hijacking.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:57:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7073 | Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Multiple WSO2 Products via SOAP Admin Services</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7073</link><description>A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper input validation in SOAP admin services. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to manipulate server-side requests, enabling access to internal and external resources available through the network or filesystem.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems, including resources within private networks, as long as they are reachable by the affected product.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:57:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7074 | Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload in Multiple WSO2 Products via SOAP Admin Service Leading to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7074</link><description>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper validation of user input in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor with administrative privileges can upload an arbitrary file to a user-controlled location on the server.

By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could upload a specially crafted payload, potentially achieving remote code execution (RCE) on the server. Exploitation requires valid admin credentials, limiting its impact to authorized but potentially malicious users.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:57:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8008 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Multiple WSO2 Products via JDBC User Store Connection Validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8008</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to insufficient output encoding in error messages generated by the JDBC user store connection validation request. A malicious actor can inject a specially crafted payload into the request, causing the browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable page.

This vulnerability may allow UI manipulation, redirection to malicious websites, or data exfiltration from the browser. However, since all session-related sensitive cookies are protected with the httpOnly flag, session hijacking is not possible.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:57:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48995 | SignXML&amp;#x27;s signature verification with HMAC is vulnerable to a timing attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48995</link><description>SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python.

When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential algorithm confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting, an attacker may supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm. Starting with SignXML 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already restricted by the user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:43:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57459 | A time-based SQL injection vulnerability exists in mydetailsstudent.php in the CloudClassroom PHP Project 1.0.

Prior to version 1.8.39, the search component does not validate permissions correctly, which allows attackers to determine the existence of hidden (draft, unapproved, or soft-deleted) threads containing specified text in the title. The visibility state (`mybb_threads.visible` integer column) of threads is not validated in internal search queries, whose result is used to output a general success or failure of the search. While MyBB validates permissions when displaying the final search results, a search operation that internally produces at least one result outputs a redirect response (as a HTTP redirect, or a success message page with delayed redirect, depending on configuration). On the other hand, a search operation that internally produces no results outputs a corresponding message in the response without a redirect. This allows a user to determine whether threads matching title search parameters exist, including draft threads (`visible` with a value of `-2`), soft-deleted threads (`visible` with a value of `-1`), and unapproved threads (`visible` with a value of `0`); in addition to displaying generally visible threads (`visible` with a value of `1`). This vulnerability does not affect other layers of permissions. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the user must have access to the search functionality, and general access to forums containing the thread(s). The vulnerability does not expose the message content of posts. MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:14:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48940 | MyBB&amp;#x27;s upgrade component vulnerable to local file inclusion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48940</link><description>MyBB is free and open source forum software. Prior to version 1.8.39, the upgrade component does not validate user input properly, which allows attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) via a specially crafted parameter value. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the installer must be unlocked (no `install/lock` file present) and the upgrade script must be accessible (by re-installing the forum via access to `install/index.php`; when the forum has not yet been installed; or the attacker is authenticated as a forum administrator).

A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48958 | Froxlor has an HTML Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48958</link><description>Froxlor is open source server administration software.

Version 0.0.2 has a 1-byte heap overflow in `rt_copy_memory`, which unconditionally wrote a null terminator at `dst[len]`. When `len` equals the size of the destination buffer (256 bytes), that extra `'\0'` write overruns the buffer by one byte. To avoid breaking existing callers or changing the public API, the patch in commit fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee takes a minimal approach: it simply removes the overflow-causing line without adding bounds checks or altering the function signature.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48495 | Gokapi has stored XSS vulnerability in friendly name for API keys</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48495</link><description>Gokapi is a self-hosted file sharing server with automatic expiration and encryption support.

If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0.

The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases.
