It means rxe_post_recv was called after rdma_destroy_qp().
This happened because put_receive_buffer() was triggered
by ib_drain_qp() and called:

ASoC: codec: sma1307: Fix memory corruption in sma1307_setting_loaded()

The sma1307-&gt;set.header_size is how many integers are in the header
(there are 8 of them) but instead of allocating space of 8 integers
we allocate 8 bytes.  This leads to memory corruption when we copy data
it on the next line:

        memcpy(sma1307-&gt;set.header, data,
               sma1307-&gt;set.header_size * sizeof(int));

Also since we're immediately copying over the memory in -&gt;set.header,
there is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array()
to allocate the memory instead.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 07:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39936 | crypto: ccp - Always pass in an error pointer to __sev_platform_shutdown_locked()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39936</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rfkill: gpio: Fix crash due to dereferencering uninitialized pointer

Since commit 7d5e9737efda ("net: rfkill: gpio: get the name and type from
device property") rfkill_find_type() gets called with the possibly
uninitialized "const char *type_name;" local variable.

On x86 systems when rfkill-gpio binds to a "BCM4752" or "LNV4752"
acpi_device, the rfkill-&gt;type is set based on the ACPI acpi_device_id:

        rfkill-&gt;type = (unsigned)id-&gt;driver_data;

and there is no "type" property so device_property_read_string() will fail
and leave type_name uninitialized, leading to a potential crash.

rfkill_find_type() does accept a NULL pointer, fix the potential crash
by initializing type_name to NULL.

Note likely sofar this has not been caught because:

1. Not many x86 machines actually have a "BCM4752"/"LNV4752" acpi_device
2. The stack happened to contain NULL where type_name is stored</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 07:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39938 | ASoC: qcom: q6apm-lpass-dais: Fix NULL pointer dereference if source graph failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39938</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Fix memory corruption when using identity domain

zpci_get_iommu_ctrs() returns counter information to be reported as part
of device statistics; these counters are stored as part of the s390_domain.
The problem, however, is that the identity domain is not backed by an
s390_domain and so the conversion via to_s390_domain() yields a bad address
that is zero'd initially and read on-demand later via a sysfs read.
These counters aren't necessary for the identity domain; just return NULL
in this case.

This issue was discovered via KASAN with reports that look like:

octeontx2-pf: Fix use-after-free bugs in otx2_sync_tstamp()

The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in otx2_ptp_destroy(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item synctstamp_work has fully
completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios
where otx2_ptp is deallocated by otx2_ptp_destroy(), while synctstamp_work
remains active and attempts to dereference otx2_ptp in otx2_sync_tstamp().
Furthermore, the synctstamp_work is cyclic, the likelihood of triggering
the bug is nonnegligible.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (cleanup)           | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
otx2_remove()             |
  otx2_ptp_destroy()      | otx2_sync_tstamp()
    cancel_delayed_work() |
    kfree(ptp)            |

artificial delays within the otx2_sync_tstamp() function to increase the

cnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task

The original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw(),
which does not guarantee that the delayed work item 'delete_task' has
fully completed if it was already running. Additionally, the delayed work
item is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only
blocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the
workqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after
flush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the
flush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have
finished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.
This leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated
by cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to
dereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
cnic_netdev_event()          |
  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()
    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...
      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()
      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/
                             | queue_delayed_work()
  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance
                             |   dev = cp-&gt;dev; //use

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any
ongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is
deallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses
__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently
executing instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()
becomes redundant and should be removed.

This bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue
and validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and
introduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()
within the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood
of triggering the bug.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 07:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39946 | tls: make sure to abort the stream if headers are bogus</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39946</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: make sure to abort the stream if headers are bogus

Normally we wait for the socket to buffer up the whole record
before we service it. If the socket has a tiny buffer, however,
we read out the data sooner, to prevent connection stalls.
Make sure that we abort the connection when we find out late
that the record is actually invalid. Retrying the parsing is
fine in itself but since we copy some more data each time
before we parse we can overflow the allocated skb space.

Constructing a scenario in which we're under pressure without
enough data in the socket to parse the length upfront is quite
hard. syzbot figured out a way to do this by serving us the header
in small OOB sends, and then filling in the recvbuf with a large
normal send.

Make sure that tls_rx_msg_size() aborts strp, if we reach
an invalid record there's really no way to recover.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 07:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39947 | net/mlx5e: Harden uplink netdev access against device unbind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39947</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames

The ice_put_rx_mbuf() function handles calling ice_put_rx_buf() for each
buffer in the current frame. This function was introduced as part of
handling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.

It works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the
total number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program
was executed.

If the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in
ice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added
as fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a
fragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't
call ice_put_rx_buf().

Because we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the
page or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't
increment next_to_alloc.

The ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented
properly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since
this function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top
of the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.

Note that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The
ice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a
single-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear
precisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,
but it happens somewhat regularly with "jumbo frames" used by 9K MTU.

To fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on
all buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a
similar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic
also in ice_get_pgcnts().

Instead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which
iterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just
past the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does
call ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of
packet.

For non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting
the pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of
the frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only
update the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still
remaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for
fragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.

The xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and
only once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from
ice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function
directly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra
bit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.

Move the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*
all calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic
requires the index of the element just after the current frame.

Now that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no
longer need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 07:38:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39949 | qed: Don&amp;#x27;t collect too many protection override GRC elements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39949</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Problem scenario:
1. CPU0 mounts perf_event (rebind_subsystems)
2. CPU1 unmounts net_prio (cgroup_kill_sb), queuing root destruction work
3. A dying perf_event CSS gets queued for offline after root destruction
4. Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is
   blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)

Solution:
Split cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues:
cgroup_offline_wq – Handles CSS offline operations
cgroup_release_wq – Manages resource release
cgroup_free_wq – Performs final memory deallocation

This separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for
offline operations to complete.

In versions 1.7 and below, a vulnerability in the way Cursor CLI Agent protects its sensitive files (i.e. */.cursor/cli.json) allows attackers to modify the content of the files through prompt injection, thus achieving remote code execution.

In versions 1.7 and below, automatic loading of project-specific CLI configuration from the current working directory (/.cursor/cli.json) could override certain global configurations in Cursor CLI. This allowed users running the CLI inside a malicious repository to be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through a combination of permissive configuration (allowing shell commands) and prompt injection delivered via project-specific Rules (/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc) or other mechanisms. The fix for this issue is currently available as a patch 2025.09.17-25b418f.

In versions 1.7 and below, when MCP uses OAuth authentication with an untrusted MCP server, an attacker can impersonate a malicious MCP server and return crafted, maliciously injected commands during the interaction process, leading to command injection and potential remote code execution. If chained with an untrusted MCP service via OAuth, this command injection vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the host by the agent. This can then be used to directly compromise the system by executing malicious commands with full user privileges. This issue does not currently have a fixed release version, but there is a patch, 2025.09.17-25b418f.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:55:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61590 | Cursor is vulnerable to RCE via .code-workspace files using Prompt Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61590</link><description>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6 and below are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks through Visual Studio Code Workspaces. Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:46:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34226 | OpenPLC Runtime v3 Persistent DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34226</link><description>OpenPLC Runtime v3 contains an input validation flaw in the /upload-program-action endpoint: the epoch_time field supplied during program uploads is not validated and can be crafted to induce corruption of the programs database.

The device accepts unauthenticated SetAVTransportURI SOAP requests over TCP/16398 and attempts to retrieve externally referenced URIs, including attacker-controlled payloads. The blind SSRF allows for sending requests on behalf of the TV, which can be leveraged to probe for other internal or external services accessible by the device (e.g., 127.0.0.1:16XXX, LAN services, or internet targets), potentially enabling additional exploit chains.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 15:11:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10729 | Use-after-free vulnerability in Qt SVG qsvghandler.cpp allows denial of service via crafted SVG</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10729</link><description>The module will parse a  node which is not a child of a structural node.

In versions 1.6 and below, Mermaid (a to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. Some additional bypasses not covered in the initial fix to this issue were discovered, see GHSA-43wj-mwcc-x93p. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 06:51:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59536 | Claude Code&amp;#x27;s startup trust dialog could lead to  Command Execution attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59536</link><description>Claude Code is an agentic coding tool.
