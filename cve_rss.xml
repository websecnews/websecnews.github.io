However, when misconfigured in /etc/sudoers, zsudo can be invoked by low-privileged users to execute arbitrary commands as root. This flaw enables local attackers with shell access to escalate privileges by writing a payload to a writable directory and executing it via zsudo. The vulnerability is particularly impactful in post-exploitation scenarios following web server compromise, where the attacker inherits access to zsudo.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:41:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2013-10054 | LibrettoCMS File Manager Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-10054</link><description>An unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in LibrettoCMS version 1.1.7 (and possibly earlier) contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in its File Manager plugin. The upload handler located at adm/ui/js/ckeditor/plugins/pgrfilemanager/php/upload.php fails to properly validate file extensions, allowing attackers to upload files with misleading extensions and subsequently rename them to executable .php scripts.
