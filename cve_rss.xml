A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user’s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update ` with a remote URL outside of github.com. Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.10 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 21:30:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4913 | Campcodes Online Examination System exam.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4913</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Campcodes Online Examination System 1.0.

Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:38:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35108 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;dataType=&amp;data...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35108</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;amp;dataType=&amp;amp;dataTypeCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35109 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;nohrefStr=close.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35109</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;amp;nohrefStr=close.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4199 | Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress &amp;lt;= 4.2.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Missing Authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4199</link><description>The Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on the plugin's AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.3.

Commit 2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430 added the proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address. Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.

In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may 
enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the
 designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 20:30:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-28132 | The T-Soft E-Commerce 4 web application is susceptible to SQL injection (SQLi) attacks when authenticated as an admin or privileged user.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:28:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32021 | Local Git clone may hardlink arbitrary user-readable files into the new repository&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;objects/&amp;quot; directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32021</link><description>Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning
will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0862 | The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that allows an a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0862</link><description>The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to relay HTTP requests from the Protection server to otherwise private network addresses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3676 | The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains an Improper Input Validation vulnerability that allows an un...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3676</link><description>The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains an Improper Input Validation vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker with a specially crafted HTTP request to create additional Encryption user accounts under the attacker's control.  These accounts are able to send spoofed email to any users within the domains configured by the Administrator.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32020 | Cloning local Git repository by untrusted user allows the untrusted user to modify objects in the cloned repository at will</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32020</link><description>Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a "proper" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:07:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2637 | Insecure Loading of Code in B&amp;amp;R Products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2637</link><description>An authenticated local attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could insert and run arbitrary code using legitimate B&amp;amp;R software's.

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 18:43:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33485 | SQL Injection vulnerability in CASAP Automated Enrollment System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code V1.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain s...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33485</link><description>SQL Injection vulnerability in CASAP Automated Enrollment System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code V1.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the login.php component</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 18:21:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27110 | Elevation of privilege vulnerability in GE HealthCare EchoPAC products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27110</link><description>Elevation of privilege vulnerability in GE HealthCare EchoPAC products</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 17:27:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4367 | A type check was missing when handling fonts in PDF.js, which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the PDF.js context.

The script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right. This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6. A workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:56:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34717 | Anonymous PrestaShop customer can download other customers&amp;#x27; invoices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34717</link><description>PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application.

Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.

This vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn't have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34713 | sshproxy vulnerable to SSH option injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34713</link><description>sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on the gateway to an internal host via SSH.

When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 14:40:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34357 | TYPO3 vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in ShowImageController</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34357</link><description>TYPO3 is an enterprise content management system.

A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them.

When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.

The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.

It is possible for users to be considered as the requester of a specific wiki request if their local user ID on any wiki in a wiki farm matches the local ID of the requester at the wiki where the wiki request was made. This allows them to go to that request entry's on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where their local user ID matches and take any actions that the wiki requester is allowed to take from there.

Commit 02e0f298f8d35155c39aa74193cb7b867432c5b8 fixes the issue. Important note about the fix: This vulnerability has been fixed by disabling access to the REST API and special pages outside of the wiki configured as the "global wiki" in `$wgCreateWikiGlobalWiki` in a user's MediaWiki settings.

As a workaround, it is possible to disable the special pages outside of one's own global wiki by doing something similar to `miraheze/mw-config` commit e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc that is adapted to one's own setup. As for the REST API, before the fix, there wasn't any REST endpoint that allowed one to make writes. Regardless, it is possible to also disable it outside of the global wiki by using `$wgCreateWikiDisableRESTAPI` and `$wgConf` in the configuration for one's own wiki farm..</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 16:09:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34698 | Prototype Pollution in getQueryParam Function (URL Query Parser)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34698</link><description>FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values, which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 16:09:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-18305 | Extreme Networks EXOS before v.22.7 and before v.30.2 was discovered to contain an issue in its Web GUI which fails to restrict URL access, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-18305</link><description>Extreme Networks EXOS before v.22.7 and before v.30.2 was discovered to contain an issue in its Web GUI which fails to restrict URL access, allowing attackers to access sensitive information or escalate privileges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33250 | An issue in Open-Source Technology Committee SRS real-time video server RS/4.0.268(Leo) and SRS/4.0.195(Leo) allows a remote attacker to exe...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33250</link><description>An issue in Open-Source Technology Committee SRS real-time video server RS/4.0.268(Leo) and SRS/4.0.195(Leo) allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34081 | MantisBT Cross-site Scripting vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34081</link><description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.

In Matrix, the server-side *key backup* stores encrypted copies of Matrix message keys. This facilitates key sharing between a user's devices and provides a redundant copy in case all devices are lost. The key backup uses asymmetric cryptography, with each server-side key backup assigned a unique public-private key pair. Due to a logic bug introduced in commit 71136e44c03c79f80d6d1a2446673bc4d53a2067, the Matrix Rust SDK version 0.7.0 will sometimes log the private part of the backup key pair to Rust debug logs (using the `tracing` crate).

A stored HTML Injection vulnerability has been identified in the Email Receival Module of the Freescout Application. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTML content into emails sent to the application's mailbox. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTML content within incoming emails, allowing attackers to embed malicious HTML code in the context of the application's domain. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML content into emails. This could lead to various attacks such as form hijacking, application defacement, or data exfiltration via CSS injection. Although unauthenticated attackers are limited to HTML injection, the consequences can still be severe. Version 1.8.139 implements strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that any HTML content received via emails is properly sanitized to prevent malicious HTML injections.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:52:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34080 | MantisBT Vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34080</link><description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.

Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 15:42:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34340 | Authentication Bypass when using using older password hashes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34340</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.

Versions of Cacti prior to 1.2.27 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, a type of cross-site scripting where malicious scripts are permanently stored on a target server and served to users who access a particular page. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:59:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28866 | GoCD vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting possible on server loading page during start-up</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28866</link><description>GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:59:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25641 | Cacti RCE vulnerability when importing packages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25641</link><description>Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable through the "Package Import" feature, allows authenticated users having the "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:39:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4819 | Campcodes Online Laundry Management System admin_class.php improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4819</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Campcodes Online Laundry Management System 1.0.

drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2

This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move
on same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old
location is simply not available any more.

Some fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the move
notification before actually moving things because only this way we have
the correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.

Also rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the eviction
counter before the move.

v2: add missing NULL check</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:34:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52655 | usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52655</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit

If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()
as length will wrap around ending up as some very
large value.

The driver will then proceed to parse the header
located at that position, which will either oops or
process some random value.

The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
since the introduction of the driver.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35167 | WordPress Envo&amp;#x27;s Elementor Templates &amp;amp; Widgets for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;=1.4.8 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35167</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in EnvoThemes Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.4.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35169 | WordPress All Bootstrap Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.15 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35169</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in AREOI All Bootstrap Blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects All Bootstrap Blocks: from n/a through 1.3.15.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4067 | Regular Expression Denial of Service in micromatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4067</link><description>The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4068 | Memory Exhaustion in braces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4068</link><description>The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user sends "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35170 | WordPress Sticky banner plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35170</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Hidden Depth Sticky banner allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Sticky banner: from n/a through 1.2.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4747 | WordPress Propovoice CRM plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.6.2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4747</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Propovoice Propovoice CRM allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Propovoice CRM: from n/a through 1.7.6.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4813 | Ruijie RG-UAC interface_commit.php os command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4813</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Ruijie RG-UAC up to 20240506.
