Versions 5.0.0-beta1 through 5.0.3 do not have password validation. During the transition from v4 to v5 an error was introduced into validation code which causes the validation of the previous password not to run as expected. This makes it possible for a logged in user to change their password in the back office without knowing the previous password. For example, if a user logs into their account and walks away without locking their workstation, an attacker could access the unattended session and change the password, therefore locking the legitimate user out. This issue is fixed in version 5.0.4.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 02:09:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67720 | Pyrofork has a Path Traversal in download_media Method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67720</link><description>Pyrofork is a modern, asynchronous MTProto API framework. Versions 2.3.68 and earlier do not properly sanitize filenames received from Telegram messages in the download_media method before using them in file path construction. When downloading media, if the user does not specify a custom filename (which is the common/default usage), the method falls back to using the file_name attribute from the media object. The attribute originates from Telegram's DocumentAttributeFilename and is controlled by the message sender. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.69.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 02:09:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67718 | Formio improperly authorized permission elevation through specially crafted request path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67718</link><description>Form.io is a combined Form and API platform for Serverless applications.

Versions 1.2.0 and below do not enforce CSRF token validation in the REST API. As a result, an attacker could craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated user on a wiki with the extension enabled, would trigger unintended authenticated actions through the victim's browser. Due to the lack of token validation, an attacker can delete or track progress against tables. This issue is patched in version 1.2.1 of the extension.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:51:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67644 | LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint is vulnerable to SQL Injection via metadata filter key in checkpointer list method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67644</link><description>LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint is an implementation of LangGraph CheckpointSaver that uses SQLite DB (both sync and async, via aiosqlite).

Versions 2.8.11 and below use MySQLSelectTool, which is vulnerable to Read-Only Bypass.  MySQLSelectTool is intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for LLM agent querying, however, validation based on the first keyword (e.g., SELECT) and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing constructs such as INTO OUTFILE / INTO DUMPFILE. As a result, an attacker who can influence the tool input (e.g., via prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may write arbitrary files to the DB server if the MySQL/MariaDB account has the FILE privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory).

In versions 2.8.11 and below, the MySQLWriteTool executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using PDO::prepare() + execute() without semantic restrictions. This is consistent with the name (“write tool”), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, DELETE, ALTER, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions). Deployments that expose an agent with MySQLWriteTool enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges are impacted. This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:11:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67513 | FreePBX Endpoint Manager&amp;#x27;s Weak Default Password Allows Unauthenticated Access in Endpoint Module REST API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67513</link><description>FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems.

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read.

The endpoint does not implement CSRF protections such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that submits a username-change request; when a victim visits the page while authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds.

While not an optimal patch, we have considered this sufficient and recommend users proceed to use the plugin with caution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9056 | Unprotected service in the AudioLink component allows a local attacker to overwrite system files via unauthorized service invocation.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9056</link><description>Unprotected service in the AudioLink component allows a local attacker to overwrite system files via unauthorized service invocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13613 | Elated Membership &amp;lt;= 1.2 - Authentication Bypass via Social Login</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13613</link><description>The Elated Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.

Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0  inadvertently forward all traffic with the same destination port as the host port when the portmap plugin is configured with the nftables backend, thus ignoring the destination IP. This includes traffic not intended for the node itself, i.e. traffic to containers hosted on the node. Containers that request HostPort forwarding can intercept all traffic destined for that port. This requires that the portmap plugin be explicitly configured to use the nftables backend. This issue is fixed in version 1.9.0. To workaround, configure the portmap plugin to use the iptables backend.

Versions 1.4.17 and below are subject to arbitrary code execution from cookie config. When dynamic cookies are enabled (e.g. there  an existing cookie schema), the cookie config is injected into the compiled route without first being sanitised. Availability of this exploit is generally low, but when combined with GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc, it allows for a full RCE chain. An attack requires write access to either the Elysia app's source code (in which case the vulnerability is meaningless) or write access to the cookie config (perhaps where it is assumed to be provisioned by the environment).

Due to unsafe handling and deletion of temporary files in versions 10.0.0 through 13.12.0, during the dictionary upload process an attacker with access to the backoffice can trigger predictable requests to temporary file paths. The application’s error responses (HTTP 500 when a file exists, 404 when it does not) allow the attacker to enumerate the existence of arbitrary files on the server’s filesystem. This vulnerability does not allow reading or writing file contents. In certain configurations, incomplete clean-up of temporary upload files may additionally expose the NTLM hash of the Windows account running the Umbraco application. This issue is fixed in version 13.12.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:30:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66456 | Elysia vulnerable to prototype pollution with multiple standalone schema validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66456</link><description>Elysia is a Typescript framework for request validation, type inference, OpenAPI documentation and client-server communication.

If the DLL is missing or attacker-writable locations in the search path are used, a local attacker with write permissions to the directory can plant a malicious MEAINFY.DLL. When the executable is launched, it loads the attacker-controlled library and executes code with the privileges of the process, enabling local privilege escalation when run with elevated rights.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 18:31:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34397 | MailEnable &amp;lt; 10.54 Reflected XSS in Message Parameter of Mobile/Compose.aspx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34397</link><description>MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Message parameter of /Mobile/Compose.aspx. The Message value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected into a JavaScript context in the response.

The service registers a TCP remoting channel with SOAP and binary formatters configured at TypeFilterLevel=Full and exposes default ObjectURI endpoints. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who can reach the remoting port can invoke the exposed remoting objects to read arbitrary files from the server and coerce outbound authentication, and may achieve arbitrary file write and remote code execution via known .NET Remoting exploitation techniques. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive installation and service-account data and compromise of the affected host.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 18:31:41

perf/core: Fix system hang caused by cpu-clock usage

cpu-clock usage by the async-profiler tool can trigger a system hang,
which got bisected back to the following commit by Octavia Togami:

  18dbcbfabfff ("perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage") causes this issue

The root cause of the hang is that cpu-clock is a special type of SW
event which relies on hrtimers. The __perf_event_overflow() callback
is invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and
__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()
to stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.

But that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,
which (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.

To fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set
the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()
to stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.

[ 1231.611034]        ----                    ----

[ 1231.611047]
                *** DEADLOCK ***

In this example, CPU0 would be any function accessing job-&gt;dependencies
through the xa_* functions that don't disable interrupts (eg:
drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()).

CPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling
callback so in an interrupt context. It will deadlock when trying to
grab the xa_lock which is already held by CPU0.

Replacing all xa_* usage by their xa_*_irq counterparts would fix
this issue, but Christian pointed out another issue: dma_fence_signal
takes fence.lock and so does dma_fence_add_callback.

  dma_fence_signal() // locks f1.lock
  -&gt; drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()
  -&gt; foreach dependencies
     -&gt; dma_fence_add_callback() // locks f2.lock

This will deadlock if f1 and f2 share the same spinlock.

To fix both issues, the code iterating on dependencies and re-arming them
is moved out to drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work().

net: stmmac: Correctly handle Rx checksum offload errors

The stmmac_rx function would previously set skb-&gt;ip_summed to
CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY if hardware checksum offload (CoE) was enabled
and the packet was of a known IP ethertype.

However, this logic failed to check if the hardware had actually
reported a checksum error. The hardware status, indicating a header or
payload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could
cause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.

This patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,
which is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag
is set, skb-&gt;ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,
ensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and
properly handle the corrupt packet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40338 | ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40338</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

I saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running the xe-fast-feedback
testlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.

The panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes.
Presumably what happens is that a process mmaps, unlocks because
of the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory left,
causing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since
there was nothing left to populate, and then oopses in
"mem_type_is_vram(tbo-&gt;resource-&gt;mem_type)" because tbo-&gt;resource

It's convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after

futex: Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race

sys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list() use ptrace_may_access()
to check if the calling task is allowed to access another task's
robust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the
target process.

During exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a
privileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings
may change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before
this transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information
after the target becomes privileged.

A racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which
ptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a
privileged state via exec().

For example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a
setuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T
is still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions
based on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec
immediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory
mappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T-&gt;robust_list
without synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a
now-privileged process.

This violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could
expose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger
exploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized
disclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a
potential security risk.

Take a read lock on signal-&gt;exec_update_lock prior to invoking
ptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.
This ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the
check, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of
credentials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40342 | nvme-fc: use lock accessing port_state and rport state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40342</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-fc: avoid scheduling association deletion twice

When forcefully shutting down a port via the configfs interface,
nvmet_port_subsys_drop_link() first calls nvmet_port_del_ctrls() and
then nvmet_disable_port(). Both functions will eventually schedule all
remaining associations for deletion.

The current implementation checks whether an association is about to be
removed, but only after the work item has already been scheduled. As a
result, it is possible for the first scheduled work item to free all
resources, and then for the same work item to be scheduled again for
deletion.

Because the association list is an RCU list, it is not possible to take
a lock and remove the list entry directly, so it cannot be looked up
again. Instead, a flag (terminating) must be used to determine whether
the association is already in the process of being deleted.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40344 | ASoC: Intel: avs: Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40344</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue is fixed in version 1.18.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 03:34:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66622 | matrix-sdk-base is vulnerable to DoS via custom m.room.join_rules event values</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66622</link><description>matrix-sdk-base is the base component to build a Matrix client library.

riscv: mm: add missing memcpy in kasan_init

Hi Atish,

It seems that the panic is due to the missing memcpy during kasan_init.
Could you please check whether this patch is helpful?

When doing kasan_populate, the new allocated base_pud/base_p4d should
contain kasan_early_shadow_{pud, p4d}'s content. Add the missing memcpy
to avoid page fault when read/write kasan shadow region.

Tested on:
 - qemu with sv57 and CONFIG_KASAN on.
 - qemu with sv48 and CONFIG_KASAN on.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50658 | cpufreq: qcom: fix memory leak in error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50658</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call
pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. We add a new struct

seccomp: Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.

Our syzbot instance reported memory leaks in do_seccomp() [0], similar
to the report [1].  It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter
and some objects included in it.

We can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one
seccomp() and two clone() syscalls.

The first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a
signal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the
fatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives
the signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to
user space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()
to decrement the filter's refcount.

Initially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but
the commit 3a15fb6ed92c ("seccomp: release filter after task is fully
dead") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible
that the filter is no longer used.

To keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move
copy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
free_task() for future debugging.

wifi: ath11k: fix failed to find the peer with peer_id 0 when disconnected

It has a fail log which is ath11k_dbg in ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(),
as below, it will not print when debug_mask is not set ATH11K_DBG_DATA.
	ath11k_dbg(ab, ATH11K_DBG_DATA,
		  "failed to find the peer with peer_id %d\n",
		   ppdu_info.peer_id);

When run scan with station disconnected, the peer_id is 0 for case
HAL_RX_MPDU_START in ath11k_hal_rx_parse_mon_status_tlv() which called
from ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), and the peer_id of ppdu_info is
reset to 0 in the while loop, so it does not match condition of the
check "if (ppdu_info-&gt;peer_id == HAL_INVALID_PEERID" in the loop, and
then the log "failed to find the peer with peer_id 0" print after the
check in the loop, it is below call stack when debug_mask is set
ATH11K_DBG_DATA.

The reason is this commit 01d2f285e3e5 ("ath11k: decode HE status tlv")
add "memset(ppdu_info, 0, sizeof(struct hal_rx_mon_ppdu_info))" in
ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), but the commit does not initialize
the peer_id to HAL_INVALID_PEERID, then lead the check mis-match.

ext4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption

When manipulating xattr blocks, we can deadlock infinitely looping
inside ext4_xattr_block_set() where we constantly keep finding xattr
block for reuse in mbcache but we are unable to reuse it because its
reference count is too big. This happens because cache entry for the
xattr block is marked as reusable (e_reusable set) although its
reference count is too big. When this inconsistency happens, this
inconsistent state is kept indefinitely and so ext4_xattr_block_set()
keeps retrying indefinitely.

The inconsistent state is caused by non-atomic update of e_reusable bit.
e_reusable is part of a bitfield and e_reusable update can race with
update of e_referenced bit in the same bitfield resulting in loss of one
of the updates. Fix the problem by using atomic bitops instead.

This bug has been around for many years, but it became *much* easier
to hit after commit 65f8b80053a1 ("ext4: fix race when reusing xattr

This is because the mm-&gt;context.vdso_info is NULL in vfork case. From
another side, mm-&gt;context.vdso_info either points to vdso info
for RV64 or vdso info for compat, there's no need to bloat riscv's
mm_context_t, we can handle the difference when setup the additional
page for vdso.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50675 | arm64: mte: Avoid setting PG_mte_tagged if no tags cleared or restored</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50675</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: mte: Avoid setting PG_mte_tagged if no tags cleared or restored

Prior to commit 69e3b846d8a7 ("arm64: mte: Sync tags for pages where PTE
is untagged"), mte_sync_tags() was only called for pte_tagged() entries
(those mapped with PROT_MTE). Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use
test_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, &amp;amp;page-&gt;flags) without inadvertently
setting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.

The above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any
control at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.
However, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like
swap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A
subsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination
page even if the tags were owned by KASAN.

This issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in
commit e5b8d9218951 ("arm64: mte: reset the page tag in page-&gt;flags").
When this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting
access faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the
original page-&gt;flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y):

Move the PG_mte_tagged bit setting from mte_sync_tags() to the actual
place where tags are cleared (mte_sync_page_tags()) or restored
(mte_restore_tags()).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50676 | net: rds: don&amp;#x27;t hold sock lock when cancelling work from rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50676</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot is reporting lockdep warning at rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() [1], for

even if rds_{send,recv}_worker() re-queued this work while __flush_work()
 from cancel_delayed_work_sync() was waiting for this work to complete,

This was caused because of new buffers with different RX ring count should
substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in
i40e_configure_rx_ring and reallocated again with i40e_alloc_rx_bi,
thus kfree on rx_bi caused leak of already mapped DMA.

Fix this by reallocating ZC with rx_bi_zc struct when BPF program loads. Additionally
reallocate back to rx_bi when BPF program unloads.

If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate
RX queues accordingly in XSP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53820 | loop: loop_set_status_from_info() check before assignment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53820</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

only for the receive path. IP6CB(skb)-&gt;nhoff is not set during

wifi: ath11k: Ignore frags from uninitialized peer in dp.

When max virtual ap interfaces are configured in all the bands with
ACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at
random times.
In this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for
self peer, for which rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in
datapath. While handling this fragment, crash is observed as the
rx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in
ath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags, skb null leads to exception.

To address this, before processing received fragments we check
dp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its
dp peer setup for fragment queue, else ignore processing the
fragments.

block/rq_qos: protect rq_qos apis with a new lock

commit 50e34d78815e ("block: disable the elevator int del_gendisk")
move rq_qos_exit() from disk_release() to del_gendisk(), this will
introduce some problems:

1) If rq_qos_add() is triggered by enabling iocost/iolatency through
   cgroupfs, then it can concurrent with del_gendisk(), it's not safe to
   write 'q-&gt;rq_qos' concurrently.

2) Activate cgroup policy that is relied on rq_qos will call
   rq_qos_add() and blkcg_activate_policy(), and if rq_qos_exit() is
   called in the middle, null-ptr-dereference will be triggered in
   blkcg_activate_policy().

3) blkg_conf_open_bdev() can call blkdev_get_no_open() first to find the
   disk, then if rq_qos_exit() from del_gendisk() is done before
   rq_qos_add(), then memory will be leaked.

This patch add a new disk level mutex 'rq_qos_mutex':

1) The lock will protect rq_qos_exit() directly.

2) For wbt that doesn't relied on blk-cgroup, rq_qos_add() can only be
   called from disk initialization for now because wbt can't be
   destructed until rq_qos_exit(), so it's safe not to protect wbt for
   now. Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported
   in the furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()
   directly, this is enough because blk-sysfs already synchronize
   writers with disk removal.

3) For iocost and iolatency, in order to synchronize disk removal and
   cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()
   from blkg_conf_open_bdev(), and is released in blkg_conf_exit().
   In order to fix the above memory leak, disk_live() is checked after
   holding the new lock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53824 | netlink: annotate lockless accesses to nlk-&amp;gt;max_recvmsg_len</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53824</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kcm: Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().

syzkaller found a memory leak in kcm_sendmsg(), and commit c821a88bd720
("kcm: Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()") suppressed it by
updating kcm_tx_msg(head)-&gt;last_skb if partial data is copied so that the
following sendmsg() will resume from the skb.

However, we cannot know how many bytes were copied when we get the error.
Thus, we could mess up the MSG_MORE queue.

When kcm_sendmsg() fails for SOCK_DGRAM, we should purge the queue as we
do so for UDP by udp_flush_pending_frames().

Even without this change, when the error occurred, the following sendmsg()
resumed from a wrong skb and the queue was messed up.  However, we have
yet to get such a report, and only syzkaller stumbled on it.  So, this
can be changed safely.

Note this does not change SOCK_SEQPACKET behaviour.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53826 | ubi: Fix UAF wear-leveling entry in eraseblk_count_seq_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53826</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Wear-leveling entry could be freed in error path, which may be accessed

		                   erase_count = wl-&gt;ec  // UAF!

Wear-leveling entry updating/accessing in ubi-&gt;lookuptbl should be
protected by ubi-&gt;wl_lock, fix it by adding ubi-&gt;wl_lock to serialize
wl entry accessing between wl_entry_destroy() and
eraseblk_count_seq_show().

md/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request

init_resync() inits mempool and sets conf-&gt;have_replacemnt at the beginning
of sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.

After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but
close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio-&gt;dev[i].repl_bio.

The following is one way to reproduce the issue.

  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev-&gt;recovery_cp is set
     to MaxSector.
  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf-&gt;have_replacement is set to
     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.
  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.
  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.
  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf-&gt;have_replacemnt is
     0. r10bio-&gt;dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref
     occurs.

Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.

drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
confirmed to help.

iio: adc: ina2xx: avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match

The affected lines were resulting in a NULL pointer dereference on our
platform because the device tree contained the following list of
compatible strings:

    power-sensor@40 {
        compatible = "ti,ina232", "ti,ina231";
        ...
    };

Since the driver doesn't declare a compatible string "ti,ina232", the OF
matching succeeds on "ti,ina231". But the I2C device ID info is
populated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in
of_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no "ina232" entry in the legacy
I2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the
probe function is NULL.

Fix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which
points to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a
generic one to the ina2xx_config table.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53835 | ext4: don&amp;#x27;t clear SB_RDONLY when remounting r/w until quota is re-enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53835</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes

There is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced
after userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt
dropped to zer0 causing use after free.

The flow is the following:

  while ((skb = skb_peek(&amp;amp;psock-&gt;ingress_skb))
    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock, skb, ..., ingress)
    if (!ingress) ...
    sk_psock_skb_ingress
       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)
          msg-&gt;skb = skb
          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock, msg)
    skb_dequeue(&amp;amp;psock-&gt;ingress_skb)

The sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is
what the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can
read this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook
will also read msg-&gt;skb and then after user space reads the msg will call
consume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.

But, the race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to
the skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the
user reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.

The !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses
sendmsg_*(sk, msg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the
stack.

The following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen':

To fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the
engress queue. This bumps the skb-&gt;users refcnt so that consume_skb()
and kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can
be sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just
need to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which
we do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg
case.

Before locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we
couldn't race with user and there was no issue here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53837 | drm/msm: fix NULL-deref on snapshot tear down</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53837</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Recent changes in net-next (commit 759ab1edb56c ("net: store netdevs
in an xarray")) refactored the handling of pre-assigned ifindexes
and let syzbot surface a latent problem in ovs. ovs does not validate
ifindex, making it possible to create netdev ports with negative
ifindex values. It's easy to repro with YNL:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_datapath.yaml \
         --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": 1, "name":"my-dp"}'
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

$ ip link show
-65536: some-port0:  mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 7a:48:21:ad:0b:fb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
...

Validate the inputs. Now the second command correctly returns:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

nilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()

If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block
address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,
nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as
-ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.

This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing
it to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.

In particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,
semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.

Fix this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block
address translation failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead
of returning the error code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53846 | f2fs: fix to do sanity check on direct node in truncate_dnode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53846</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The root cause is, inodeA references inodeB via inodeB's ino, once inodeA
is truncated, it calls truncate_dnode() to truncate data blocks in inodeB's
node page, it traverse mapping data from node-&gt;i.i_addr[0] to
node-&gt;i.i_addr[ADDRS_PER_BLOCK() - 1], result in out-of-boundary access.

This patch fixes to add sanity check on dnode page in truncate_dnode(),
so that, it can help to avoid triggering such issue, and once it encounters
such issue, it will record newly introduced ERROR_INVALID_NODE_REFERENCE
error into superblock, later fsck can detect such issue and try repairing.

Also, it removes f2fs_truncate_data_blocks() for cleanup due to the
function has only one caller, and uses f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range()
instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53847 | usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53847</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB
transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What
should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a
reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is
present.

A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in
alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the
call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
a debugging message.

Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact
that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.
Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for
uses like this.  We'll use it instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53848 | md/raid5-cache: fix a deadlock in r5l_exit_log()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53848</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: Drop aux devices together with DP controller

Using devres to depopulate the aux bus made sure that upon a probe
deferral the EDP panel device would be destroyed and recreated upon next
attempt.

But the struct device which the devres is tied to is the DPUs
(drm_dev-&gt;dev), which may be happen after the DP controller is torn
down.

Indications of this can be seen in the commonly seen EDID-hexdump full
of zeros in the log, or the occasional/rare KASAN fault where the
panel's attempt to read the EDID information causes a use after free on
DP resources.

It's tempting to move the devres to the DP controller's struct device,
but the resources used by the device(s) on the aux bus are explicitly
torn down in the error path. The KASAN-reported use-after-free also
remains, as the DP aux "module" explicitly frees its devres-allocated
memory in this code path.

As such, explicitly depopulate the aux bus in the error path, and in the
component unbind path, to avoid these issues.

ASoC: mediatek: mt8186: Fix use-after-free in driver remove path

When devm runs function in the "remove" path for a device it runs them
in the reverse order. That means that if you have parts of your driver
that aren't using devm or are using "roll your own" devm w/
devm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.

The mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in
mt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then
went on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of
mt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call
mt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,
the order was wrong.

Specifically at probe time, the order was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()
2. afe_priv-&gt;clk = devm_kcalloc(...)
3. afe_priv-&gt;clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)

At remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()
3. Free all of afe_priv-&gt;clk[i]
2. Free afe_priv-&gt;clk

The above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to
fix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let's move the
devm_add_action_or_reset() to the right place. In addition to fixing
the use-after-free, code inspection shows that this fixes a leak
(missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have
happened if any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in
mt8186_init_clock() had failed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53855 | net: dsa: ocelot: call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() under rtnl_lock() on driver remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53855</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This was somewhat not so easy to spot, because "ocelot-8021q" is not the
default tagging protocol, and thus, not everyone who tests the unbinding
path may have switched to it beforehand. The default
felix_tag_npi_teardown() does not require rtnl_lock() to be held.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53856 | of: overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53856</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early

When of_overlay_fdt_apply() fails, the changeset may be partially
applied, and the caller is still expected to call of_overlay_remove() to
clean up this partial state.

However, of_overlay_apply() calls of_resolve_phandles() before
init_overlay_changeset().  Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an
unresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still
uninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in
overlay_removal_is_ok().

Fix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from
init_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other
early initialization is done.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53857 | bpf: bpf_sk_storage: Fix invalid wait context lockdep report</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53857</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It complains about acquiring a local_lock while holding a raw_spin_lock.
It means it should not allocate memory while holding a raw_spin_lock
since it is not safe for RT.

raw_spin_lock is needed because bpf_local_storage supports tracing
context. In particular for task local storage, it is easy to
get a "current" task PTR_TO_BTF_ID in tracing bpf prog.
However, task (and cgroup) local storage has already been moved to
bpf mem allocator which can be used after raw_spin_lock.

The splat is for the sk storage. For sk (and inode) storage,
it has not been moved to bpf mem allocator. Using raw_spin_lock or not,
kzalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) could theoretically be unsafe in tracing context.
However, the local storage helper requires a verifier accepted
sk pointer (PTR_TO_BTF_ID), it is hypothetical if that (mean running
a bpf prog in a kzalloc unsafe context and also able to hold a verifier
accepted sk pointer) could happen.

This patch avoids kzalloc after raw_spin_lock to silent the splat.
There is an existing kzalloc before the raw_spin_lock. At that point,
a kzalloc is very likely required because a lookup has just been done
before. Thus, this patch always does the kzalloc before acq

dm: don't attempt to queue IO under RCU protection

dm looks up the table for IO based on the request type, with an
assumption that if the request is marked REQ_NOWAIT, it's fine to
attempt to submit that IO while under RCU read lock protection. This
is not OK, as REQ_NOWAIT just means that we should not be sleeping
waiting on other IO, it does not mean that we can't potentially
schedule.

A simple test case demonstrates this quite nicely:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        struct iovec iov;
        int fd;

        fd = open("/dev/dm-0", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECT);
        posix_memalign(&amp;amp;iov.iov_base, 4096, 4096);
        iov.iov_len = 4096;
        preadv2(fd, &amp;amp;iov, 1, 0, RWF_NOWAIT);
        return 0;
}

which will instantly spew:

By tracing the refcnt, I found the node is created by hfs_bmap_alloc()
with refcnt 1.  Then the node is used by hfs_btree_write().  There is a
missing of hfs_bnode_get() after find the node.  The issue happened in
following path:


 hfs_bmap_alloc
   hfs_bnode_find
     __hfs_bnode_create   &lt;- allocate a new node with refcnt 1.
   hfs_bnode_put          &lt;- decrease the refcnt

This corresponds to this line of code:

  void btrfs_put_transaction(struct btrfs_transaction *transaction)
  {
      (...)
          WARN_ON(!RB_EMPTY_ROOT(
                          &amp;amp;transaction-&gt;delayed_refs.dirty_extent_root));

  }

The warning happens because btrfs_qgroup_destroy_extent_records(), called
in the transaction abort path, we free all entries from the rbtree
"dirty_extent_root" with rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe(), but we
don't actually empty the rbtree - it's still pointing to nodes that were
freed.

So set the rbtree's root node to NULL to avoid this warning (assign
RB_ROOT).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53866 | ASoC: soc-compress: Reposition and add pcm_mutex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53866</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If panic_on_warn is set and compress stream(DPCM) is started,
then kernel panic occurred because card-&gt;pcm_mutex isn't held appropriately.
In the following functions, warning were issued at this line
"snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held".

These functions are called by soc_compr_set_params_fe, soc_compr_open_fe

without pcm_mutex locking. And this is call stack.

Versions 2.0.13 and below allow an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation, CAPTCHA protections can be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO). This issue is fixed in version 2.0.14.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66508 | 1Panel IP Access Control Bypass via Untrusted X-Forwarded-For Headers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66508</link><description>1Panel is an open-source, web-based control panel for Linux server management. Versions 2.0.14 and below use Gin's default configuration which trusts all IP addresses as proxies (TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0), allowing any client to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. Since all IP-based access controls (AllowIPs, API whitelists, localhost-only checks) rely on ClientIP(), attackers can bypass these protections by simply sending X-Forwarded-For:  127.0.0.1 or any whitelisted IP. This renders all IP-based security controls ineffective. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.14.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66565 | Fiber Utils UUIDv4 and UUID Silent Fallback to Predictable Values</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66565</link><description>Fiber Utils is a collection of common functions created for Fiber.

The address being probed has some special:

  cmdline_proc_show: Probe based on ftrace
  cmdline_proc_show+16: Probe for the next instruction at the ftrace location

The ftrace-based kprobe does not generate kprobe::ainsn::insn, it gets
set to NULL. In arch_prepare_kprobe() it will check for:

  ...
  prev = get_kprobe(p-&gt;addr - 1);
  preempt_enable_no_resched();
  if (prev &amp;&amp; ppc_inst_prefixed(ppc_inst_read(prev-&gt;ainsn.insn))) {
  ...

If prev is based on ftrace, 'ppc_inst_read(prev-&gt;ainsn.insn)' will occur
with a null pointer reference. At this point prev-&gt;addr will not be a
prefixed instruction, so the check can be skipped.

Check if prev is ftrace-based kprobe before reading 'prev-&gt;ainsn.insn'
to fix this problem.

PCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF

pci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the
Vendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they
aren't present.  Check the PF instead.

Wei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is
unbound or "0" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O
operation hangs, which may result in output like this:

  task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002

This happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned "false" in
virtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().  The broken vq
meant that vring_interrupt() skipped the vq.callback() that would have
completed the virtio I/O operation via virtblk_done().

In the above issue, ioctl invokes the swap_inode_boot_loader function to
swap inode&lt;5&gt; and inode&lt;12&gt;. However, inode&lt;5&gt; contain incorrect imode and
disordered extents, and i_nlink is set to 1. The extents check for inode in
the ext4_iget function can be bypassed bacause 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO.
While links_count is set to 1, the extents are not initialized in
swap_inode_boot_loader. After the ioctl command is executed successfully,
the extents are swapped to inode&lt;12&gt;, in this case, run the `cat` command
to view inode&lt;12&gt;. And Bug_ON is triggered due to the incorrect extents.

When the boot loader inode is not initialized, its imode can be one of the
following:
1) the imode is a bad type, which is marked as bad_inode in ext4_iget and
   set to S_IFREG.
2) the imode is good type but not S_IFREG.
3) the imode is S_IFREG.

The BUG_ON may be triggered by bypassing the check in cases 1 and 2.
Therefore, when the boot loader inode is bad_inode or its imode is not
S_IFREG, initialize the inode to avoid triggering the BUG.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50639 | io-wq: Fix memory leak in worker creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50639</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

is because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at
sdio_init_func(), but all SDIO card device reference counter gets decreased

For simplicity address the problem by adding PCI_IOBASE to the physical
address requested in the respective wrapper macros only, observing that
the raw accessors such as `__insb', `__outsb', etc. are not supposed to
be used other than by said macros.  Remove the cast to `long' that is no
longer needed on `addr' now that it is used as an offset from PCI_IOBASE
and add parentheses around `addr' needed for predictable evaluation in
macro expansion.  No need to make said adjustments in separate changes
given that current code is gravely broken and does not ever work.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50648 | ftrace: Fix recursive locking direct_mutex in ftrace_modify_direct_caller</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50648</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix reference state management for synchronous callbacks

Currently, verifier verifies callback functions (sync and async) as if
they will be executed once, (i.e. it explores execution state as if the
function was being called once). The next insn to explore is set to
start of subprog and the exit from nested frame is handled using
curframe &gt; 0 and prepare_func_exit. In case of async callback it uses a
customized variant of push_stack simulating a kind of branch to set up
custom state and execution context for the async callback.

While this approach is simple and works when callback really will be
executed only once, it is unsafe for all of our current helpers which
are for_each style, i.e. they execute the callback multiple times.

A callback releasing acquired references of the caller may do so
multiple times, but currently verifier sees it as one call inside the
frame, which then returns to caller. Hence, it thinks it released some
reference that the cb e.g. got access through callback_ctx (register
filled inside cb from spilled typed register on stack).

Similarly, it may see that an acquire call is unpaired inside the
callback, so the caller will copy the reference state of callback and
then will have to release the register with new ref_obj_ids. But again,
the callback may execute multiple times, but the verifier will only
account for acquired references for a single symbolic execution of the
callback, which will cause leaks.

Note that for async callback case, things are different. While currently
we have bpf_timer_set_callback which only executes it once, even for
multiple executions it would be safe, as reference state is NULL and
check_reference_leak would force program to release state before
BPF_EXIT. The state is also unaffected by analysis for the caller frame.
Hence async callback is safe.

Since we want the reference state to be accessible, e.g. for pointers
loaded from stack through callback_ctx's PTR_TO_STACK, we still have to
copy caller's reference_state to callback's bpf_func_state, but we
enforce that whatever references it adds to that reference_state has
been released before it hits BPF_EXIT. This requires introducing a new
callback_ref member in the reference state to distinguish between caller
vs callee references. Hence, check_reference_leak now errors out if it
sees we are in callback_fn and we have not released callback_ref refs.
Since there can be multiple nested callbacks, like frame 0 -&gt; cb1 -&gt; cb2
etc. we need to also distinguish between whether this particular ref
belongs to this callback frame or parent, and only error for our own, so
we store state-&gt;frameno (which is always non-zero for callbacks).

In short, callbacks can read parent reference_state, but cannot mutate
it, to be able to use pointers acquired by the caller. They must only
undo their changes (by releasing their own acquired_refs before
BPF_EXIT) on top of caller reference_state before returning (at which
point the caller and callback state will match anyway, so no need to
copy it back to caller).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50651 | ethtool: eeprom: fix null-deref on genl_info in dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50651</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

('myfpga' is a simple 'uio_dmem_genirq' driver I wrote to test this)

The implementation of "uio_dmem_genirq" was based on "uio_pdrv_genirq" and
it is used in a similar manner to the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver with respect
to interrupt configuration and handling. At the time "uio_dmem_genirq" was
introduced, both had the same implementation of the 'uio_info' handlers
irqcontrol() and handler(). Then commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix concurrency
issue"), which was only applied to "uio_pdrv_genirq", ended up making them
a little different. That commit, among other things, changed disable_irq()
to disable_irq_nosync() in the implementation of irqcontrol(). The
motivation there was to avoid a deadlock between irqcontrol() and
handler(), since it added a spinlock in the irq handler, and disable_irq()
waits for the completion of the irq handler.

By changing disable_irq() to disable_irq_nosync() in irqcontrol(), we also
avoid the sleeping-whil

erofs: kill hooked chains to avoid loops on deduplicated compressed images

After heavily stressing EROFS with several images which include a
hand-crafted image of repeated patterns for more than 46 days, I found
two chains could be linked with each other almost simultaneously and
form a loop so that the entire loop won't be submitted.  As a
consequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.

It can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.
For example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total:
	Chain 1:  2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;
        Chain 2:  5-&gt;1-&gt;2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.

Chain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link
to Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.

Since hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how
to simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely
until I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally
tell us that it's needed to add it back.

Actually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads
(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm
not sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared
with implementation complexity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53778 | accel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53778</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()

The encode_dma() function has some validation on in_trans-&gt;size but it
would be more clear to move those checks to find_and_map_user_pages().

The encode_dma() had two checks:

	if (in_trans-&gt;addr + in_trans-&gt;size &lt; in_trans-&gt;addr || !in_trans-&gt;size)
		return -EINVAL;

The in_trans-&gt;addr variable is the starting address.  The in_trans-&gt;size
variable is the total size of the transfer.  The transfer can occur in
parts and the resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size tracks how many bytes we have
already transferred.

This patch introduces a new variable "remaining" which represents the
amount we want to transfer (in_trans-&gt;size) minus the amount we have
already transferred (resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size).

I have modified the check for if in_trans-&gt;size is zero to instead check
if in_trans-&gt;size is less than resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size.  If we have
already transferred more bytes than in_trans-&gt;size then there are negative
bytes remaining which doesn't make sense.  If there are zero bytes
remaining to be copied, just return success.

The check in encode_dma() checked that "addr + size" could not overflow
and barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if
we do this in parts.  First check that "in_trans-&gt;addr +
resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size" is safe.  Then check that "xfer_start_addr +
remaining" is safe.

My final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit
systems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits.  So
I calculated "total = in_trans-&gt;size + offset_in_page(xfer_start_addr);"
and returned -EINVAL if it were &gt;= SIZE_MAX.  This will not affect 64bit
systems.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53779 | mfd: dln2: Fix memory leak in dln2_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53779</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().

With Eric's ref tracker, syzbot finally found a repro for
use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler() by kernel TCP
sockets. [0]

If SMC creates a kernel socket in __smc_create(), the kernel
socket is supposed to be freed in smc_clcsock_release() by
calling sock_release() when we close() the parent SMC socket.

However, at the end of smc_clcsock_release(), the kernel
socket's sk_state might not be TCP_CLOSE.  This means that
we have not called inet_csk_destroy_sock() in __tcp_close()
and have not stopped the TCP timers.

The kernel socket's TCP timers can be fired later, so we
need to hold a refcnt for net as we do for MPTCP subflows
in mptcp_subflow_create_socket().

drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc

Commit 5d844091f237 ("drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs") changed the scdc
interface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in
the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter
information, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated
when the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.

drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to
a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer
instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.

mt76: mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers

mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() and
mt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr(), both of which blindly assume that
adequate headroom will be available in the passed skb. This assumption
typically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for
transmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an
optimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is
sometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of
another netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the
bridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.

This commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to
mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to
ensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be
pushed onto the skb.

Without this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an
MT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an
Intel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet
adapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard
SMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in
every system configuration, as they occur only if the receiving netdev
leaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its
SDIO headers.

bpf: Zeroing allocated object from slab in bpf memory allocator

Currently the freed element in bpf memory allocator may be immediately
reused, for htab map the reuse will reinitialize special fields in map
value (e.g., bpf_spin_lock), but lookup procedure may still access
these special fields, and it may lead to hard-lockup as shown below:

For htab map, just like the preallocated case, these is no need to
initialize these special fields in map value again once these fields
have been initialized. For preallocated htab map, these fields are
initialized through __GFP_ZERO in bpf_map_area_alloc(), so do the
similar thing for non-preallocated htab in bpf memory allocator. And
there is no need to use __GFP_ZERO for per-cpu bpf memory allocator,
because __alloc_percpu_gfp() does it implicitly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53791 | md: fix warning for holder mismatch from export_rdev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53791</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The solution is to not increment the refcount on the IOMMUFD_DESTROY path
at all. Instead use the xa_lock to serialize everything. The refcount
check == 1 and xa_erase can be done under a single critical region. This
avoids the need for any refcount incrementing.

It has the downside that if userspace races destroy with other operations
it will get an EBUSY instead of waiting, but this is kind of racing is
already dangerous.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53796 | f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53796</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()

When converting an inline directory to a regular one, f2fs is leaking
uninitialized memory to disk because it doesn't initialize the entire
directory block.  Fix this by zero-initializing the block.

This bug was introduced by commit 4ec17d688d74 ("f2fs: avoid unneeded

security implications of leaking uninitialized memory to disk.

HID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps

Code which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type
returned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer
enough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a
recipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur
when calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being
reported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause input
handling in userspace to appear hung.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53798 | ethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53798</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes

It is not possible to set the number of lanes when setting link modes
using the legacy IOCTL ethtool interface. Since 'struct
ethtool_link_ksettings' is not initialized in this path, drivers receive
an uninitialized number of lanes in 'struct
ethtool_link_ksettings::lanes'.

When this information is later queried from drivers, it results in the
ethtool code making decisions based on uninitialized memory, leading to
the following KMSAN splat [1]. In practice, this most likely only
happens with the tun driver that simply returns whatever it got in the
set operation.

As far as I can tell, this uninitialized memory is not leaked to user
space thanks to the 'ethtool_ops-&gt;cap_link_lanes_supported' check in
linkmodes_prepare_data().

Fix by initializing the structure in the IOCTL path. Did not find any
more call sites that pass an uninitialized structure when calling
'ethtool_ops::set_link_ksettings()'.

nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()

During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  However, since
nilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may
cause use-after-free read if inodes are left in "garbage_list" and
released by nilfs_dispose_list() at the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer().

Fix this issue by modifying nilfs_evict_inode() to only clear inode
without additional metadata changes that use nilfs_root if the file system
is degraded to read-only or the writer is detached.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53805 | tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53805</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

l2tp: Avoid possible recursive deadlock in l2tp_tunnel_register()

When a file descriptor of pppol2tp socket is passed as file descriptor
of UDP socket, a recursive deadlock occurs in l2tp_tunnel_register().
This situation is reproduced by the following program:

int main(void)
{
	int sock;
	struct sockaddr_pppol2tp addr;

	sock = socket(AF_PPPOX, SOCK_DGRAM, PX_PROTO_OL2TP);
	if (sock &lt; 0) {
		perror("socket");
		return 1;
	}

	addr.sa_family = AF_PPPOX;
	addr.sa_protocol = PX_PROTO_OL2TP;
	addr.pppol2tp.pid = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.fd = sock;
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_family = PF_INET;
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_port = htons(0);
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.0.1");
	addr.pppol2tp.s_tunnel = 1;
	addr.pppol2tp.s_session = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.d_tunnel = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.d_session = 0;

	if (connect(sock, (const struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(addr)) &lt; 0) {
		perror("connect");
		return 1;
	}

	return 0;
}

This program causes the following lockdep warning:

blk-mq: release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete

Once all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed, filesystems can call
blk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn't call
blk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens
after upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has
completed.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()
can see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.

This makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the
'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&amp;amp;slot-&gt;slot_refs) != 0)' and return without
doing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in
blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This is a very rare bug and has only
been seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)

There are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before
bio_endio() is called on the request's last bio, or make
__blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let's go with the first
solution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via
WARN_ON_ONCE) where a key is evicted while still in-use.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53811 | RDMA/irdma: Cap MSIX used to online CPUs + 1</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53811</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix rbtree traversal bug in ext4_mb_use_preallocated

During allocations, while looking for preallocations(PA) in the per
inode rbtree, we can't do a direct traversal of the tree because
ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocation() can paralelly mark the pa deleted
and that can cause direct traversal to skip some entries. This was
leading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy
our request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap
with the missed one.

To makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of
the rbtree, we make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly
overlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below
conditions:

  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of
  (ie less than) original logical start.

  2. It must not be deleted

To find this pa we use the following traversal method:

1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring
PA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if
it overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately
adjacent PA.

2. If the found PA is on right of original goal, use rb_prev() to find
the left adjacent PA.

3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until
a non deleted PA is found.

4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy
the original request and proceed accordingly.

This approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.

(While we are at it, also fix a possible overflow bug in calculating the
end of a PA)

      [] devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources.constprop.0+0xb0/0x390

When coalescing two resources for a contiguous aperture, the second
resource is enlarged to cover the full contiguous range, while the first
resource is marked invalid.  This invalidation is done by clearing the
flags, start, and end members.

When adding the initial resources to the bus later, invalid resources are
skipped.  Unfortunately, the check for an invalid resource considers only
the end member, causing false positives.

E.g. on r8a7791/koelsch, root bus resource 0 ("bus 00") is skipped, and no
longer registered with pci_bus_insert_busn_res() (causing the memory leak),
nor printed:

   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci: host bridge /soc/pci@ee090000 ranges:
   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci:      MEM 0x00ee080000..0x00ee08ffff -&gt; 0x00ee080000

  -pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00]
   pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xee080000-0xee08ffff]

Fix this by only skipping resources where all of the flags, start, and end
members are zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53815 | posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53815</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()

itimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is concurrently expired. On
non-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has completed,
except for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK
enabled.

In that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when
preempting the task which does the timer delivery.

Replace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running() to handle
it the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53816 | drm/amdkfd: fix potential kgd_mem UAFs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53816</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Versions 3.3.1 and below are subject to a XSS vulnerability through the ui.interactive_image component of NiceGUI. The component renders SVG content using Vue's v-html directive without any sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript via the SVG  tag whenever the image component is rendered or updated. This is particularly dangerous for dashboards or multi-user applications displaying user-generated content or annotations. This issue is fixed in version 3.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:56 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
