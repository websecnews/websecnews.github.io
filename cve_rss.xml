mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory

Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap
shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1]
and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].

The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag, the
zswap shrinker might get called with sc-&gt;memcg == NULL.  This is okay in
many places, like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in
memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of
cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.

Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I
was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error

The error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free
when its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least one
interrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the
interrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and
its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the
vprop_page again.

Fix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which
handles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing
from its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak when canceling rehash work

The rehash delayed work is rescheduled with a delay if the number of
credits at end of the work is not negative as supposedly it means that
the migration ended. Otherwise, it is rescheduled immediately.

After "mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during
rehash" the above is no longer accurate as a non-negative number of
credits is no longer indicative of the migration being done. It can also
happen if the work encountered an error in which case the migration will
resume the next time the work is scheduled.

The significance of the above is that it is possible for the work to be
pending and associated with hints that were allocated when the migration
started. This leads to the hints being leaked [1] when the work is
canceled while pending as part of ACL region dismantle.

Fix by freeing the hints if hints are associated with a work that was
canceled while pending.

Blame the original commit since the reliance on not having a pending
work associated with hints is fragile.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak during rehash

The rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another.
This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the same
priority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all the
filters.

If the migration fails, the code tries to migrate the filters back to
the old region. However, the rollback itself can also fail in which case
another migration will be erroneously performed. Besides the fact that
this ping pong is not a very good idea, it also creates a problem.

Each virtual chunk references two chunks: The currently used one
('vchunk-&gt;chunk') and a backup ('vchunk-&gt;chunk2'). During migration the
first holds the chunk we want to migrate filters to and the second holds
the chunk we are migrating filters from.

The code currently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunk
does not exist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference the
target region. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback a
rollback, resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked
[1].

Fix by not rolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoid
future cases.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during rehash

The rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another
according to the number of available credits.

The migrated from region is destroyed at the end of the work if the
number of credits is non-negative as the assumption is that this is
indicative of migration being complete. This assumption is incorrect as
a non-negative number of credits can also be the result of a failed
migration.

The destruction of a region that still has filters referencing it can
result in a use-after-free [1].

Fix by not destroying the region if migration failed.

iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path

The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by
calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list
of all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup
efficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device
within the probed device rbtree.

The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any
synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device
stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released
by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before
iopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.

Add a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU
release device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,
as the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is
very rare.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 14:49:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35844 | f2fs: compress: fix reserve_cblocks counting error when out of space</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35844</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix reserve_cblocks counting error when out of space

When a file only needs one direct_node, performing the following
operations will cause the file to be unrepairable:

unisoc # ./f2fs_io compress test.apk
unisoc #df -h | grep dm-48
/dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 1.2M 100% /data

unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk
F2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed: No space left on device

adb reboot
unisoc # df -h  | grep dm-48
/dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G   11M 100% /data
unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk
0

This is because the file has only one direct_node. After returning
to -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += ret will not be executed. As a result,
the reserved_blocks at this time is still 0, which is not the real
number of reserved blocks. Therefore, fsck cannot be set to repair
the file.

After this patch, the fsck flag will be set to fix this problem.

unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48
/dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G  1.8M 100% /data
unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk
F2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed: No space left on device

adb reboot then fsck will be executed

netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info

An skb can be added to a neigh-&gt;arp_queue while waiting for an arp
reply. Where original skb's skb-&gt;dev can be different to neigh's
neigh-&gt;dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to
another, the skb would be added to a neigh-&gt;arp_queue of the bridge.

As skb-&gt;dev can be reset back to nf_bridge-&gt;physindev and used, and as
there is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been
freed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from
different device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:

arp_process
  neigh_update
    skb = __skb_dequeue(&amp;amp;neigh-&gt;arp_queue)
      neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)
        ...
          br_nf_dev_xmit
            br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow
              skb-&gt;dev = nf_bridge-&gt;physindev
              br_handle_frame_finish

Let's use plain ifindex instead of net_device link. To peek into the
original net_device we will use dev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either we
get device and are safe to use it or we don't get it and drop skb.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 14:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35840 | mptcp: use OPTION_MPTCP_MPJ_SYNACK in subflow_finish_connect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35840</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_free

A splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES will cause tls code to use the
tls_sw_sendmsg_splice path in the TLS sendmsg code to move the user
provided pages from the msg into the msg_pl. This will loop over the
msg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The user
can also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receiving
more pages and ideally a full buffer.

If the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_pl
scatterlist (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and send
the buffer anyways.

What actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlist
setup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating we
can no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'
path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and
then attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next
iteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw
the warning in the syzbot report.

To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path and
if not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 14:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35842 | ASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35842</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

done in the 64-bit domain, instead of the current 32bit. The arithmetic
implies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The
register was checked to be below 1&lt;&lt;29 when it was variable, but not
when it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which
case it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller
checked it to be below 1&lt;&lt;29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a
kfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being
inconsistently checked to be below 1&lt;&lt;29, and the offset being up to an
u32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were
currently used for arithmetic.

of: Fix double free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_map

In of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that

to free the reference acquired by the previous iteration
of the inner loop. This assumes that the value of "new" is
NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop.

Make sure that this is true in all iterations of the outer
loop by setting "new" to NULL after its value is assigned to "cur".

The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different

raising pipe-&gt;max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it
would result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.

net: atlantic: eliminate double free in error handling logic

Driver has a logic leak in ring data allocation/free,
where aq_ring_free could be called multiple times on same ring,

Ring pointer was used as an indicator of failure, but this is
not correct since only ring data is allocated/deallocated.
Ring itself is an array member.

Changing ring allocation functions to return error code directly.
This simplifies error handling and eliminates aq_ring_free

io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()

The "controllen" variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it
to int could lead to an integer underflow.

The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination
which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot
fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.

However, if we cast "controllen" to an int and it turns negative, then
negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.

Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  &lt;-- overflow
 Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 &lt;-- no overflow

I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the
cast is unnecessary.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:56:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35828 | wifi: libertas: fix some memleaks in lbs_allocate_cmd_buffer()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35828</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: cachestat: fix two shmem bugs

When cachestat on shmem races with swapping and invalidation, there
are two possible bugs:

1) A swapin error can have resulted in a poisoned swap entry in the
   shmem inode's xarray. Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it
   will result in an out-of-bounds access to swapper_spaces[].

   Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.

2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode, the shadow
   entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still in
   progress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin, invalidation,
   or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the
   shmem swap entry.

   This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter
   purely operates on pointer bits, so it won't crash - node 0, memcg
   ID 0, eviction timestamp 0, etc. are all valid inputs - but it's a
   bogus test. In theory that could result in a false "recently
   evicted" count.

btrfs: fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()

There are reports from tree-checker that detects corrupted nodes,
without any obvious pattern so possibly an overwrite in memory.
After some debugging it turns out there's a race when reading an extent
buffer the uptodate status can be missed.

To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,
read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:

    /* (1) */
    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &amp;amp;eb-&gt;bflags))
        return 0;

    /* (2) */
    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &amp;amp;eb-&gt;bflags))
        goto done;

At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once
that completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does

    /* (3) */
    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);

    /* (4) */
    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &amp;amp;eb-&gt;bflags);

Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other
callers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is
a racey interleaving:

    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C
    ---------+----------+---------
       (1)   |          |
             |    (1)   |
       (2)   |          |
       (3)   |          |
       (4)   |          |
             |    (2)   |
             |          |    (1)

When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread
C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from
thread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker
errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:

    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256
    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356
    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]

Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and if
it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.

x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD

Commit 672365477ae8 ("x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required") and
commit 8bf26758ca96 ("x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate") introduced a
per CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in
order to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.

On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which
wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not
reset, which brings them out of sync.

As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update
the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel
space, which crashes the kernel.

To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together
with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35802 | x86/sev: Fix position dependent variable references in startup code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35802</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sev: Fix position dependent variable references in startup code

The early startup code executes from a 1:1 mapping of memory, which
differs from the mapping that the code was linked and/or relocated to
run at. The latter mapping is not active yet at this point, and so
symbol references that rely on it will fault.

Given that the core kernel is built without -fPIC, symbol references are
typically emitted as absolute, and so any such references occuring in
the early startup code will therefore crash the kernel.

While an attempt was made to work around this for the early SEV/SME
startup code, by forcing RIP-relative addressing for certain global
SEV/SME variables via inline assembly (see snp_cpuid_get_table() for
example), RIP-relative addressing must be pervasively enforced for
SEV/SME global variables when accessed prior to page table fixups.

__startup_64() already handles this issue for select non-SEV/SME global
variables using fixup_pointer(), which adjusts the pointer relative to a
`physaddr` argument. To avoid having to pass around this `physaddr`
argument across all functions needing to apply pointer fixups, introduce
a macro RIP_RELATIVE_REF() which generates a RIP-relative reference to
a given global variable. It is used where necessary to force
RIP-relative accesses to global variables.

For backporting purposes, this patch makes no attempt at cleaning up
other occurrences of this pattern, involving either inline asm or
fixup_pointer(). Those will be addressed later.

  [ bp: Call it "rip_rel_ref" everywhere like other code shortens
    "rIP-relative reference" and make the asm wrapper __always_inline. ]</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35803 | x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware&amp;#x27;s stack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35803</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware's stack

Normally, the EFI stub calls into the EFI boot services using the stack
that was live when the stub was entered. According to the UEFI spec,
this stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large but
all asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the same
stack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.

In mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader calls
the 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bit
entry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocation
of 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in
64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be using
the decompressor's limited boot stack.

Due to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, any
stack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit

  5c4feadb0011983b ("x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code")

moved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the boot
stack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns will
corrupt the end of the .data section.

While it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size of
the boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed mode
systems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.

So instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering from
the 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI boot
service call is made.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35804 | KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirty</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35804</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirty

When emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest, mark the target
gfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  This
fixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during live
migration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that the
page is dirty.

Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulated
CMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitly
mapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty during
the unmap phase.

Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is written
back on failure, i.e. the page is still written.  The value written is
guaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABI
is that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  And
more importantly, that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.

Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others), who did all the
actual work of triaging and debugging.

ext4: fix corruption during on-line resize

We observed a corruption during on-line resize of a file system that is
larger than 16 TiB with 4k block size. With having more then 2^32 blocks
resize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can be
reproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitly
turning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (the
size of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:

  dev=/dev/ # should be &gt;= 16 GiB
  mkdir -p /corruption
  /sbin/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))
  mount -t ext4 $dev /corruption

  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 of=/corruption/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))
  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  /corruption/test

  /sbin/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))
  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk
  echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  /corruption/test

2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks per
block group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a meta
block group.

The last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laid
out across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physical
block 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of the
meta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the file
system will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is
2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, in
ext4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of the
first meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this by
substracting the size of a whole block group from the point where the
meta block group would start. This must be considered when updating the
backup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout. The fix
is to add a test whether the group to add is already part of the meta
block group or not.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35808 | md/dm-raid: don&amp;#x27;t call md_reap_sync_thread() directly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35808</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/PM: Drain runtime-idle callbacks before driver removal

A race condition between the .runtime_idle() callback and the .remove()
callback in the rtsx_pcr PCI driver leads to a kernel crash due to an
unhandled page fault [1].

The problem is that rtsx_pci_runtime_idle() is not expected to be running
after pm_runtime_get_sync() has been called, but the latter doesn't really
guarantee that.  It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks
will not be running when it returns.

However, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when
pm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM
status of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without
waiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for
.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it
arguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly
prohibited).

Thus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs
to protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after
pm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after
pm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it
has started earlier.]

One way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()
after pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the
runtime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from
being invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should
it be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in
pci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the
driver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which
will prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr
driver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35810 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix the lifetime of the bo cursor memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35810</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handling

Commit bbb73a103fbb ("swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix"),
which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 ("swiotlb: fix slot alignment
checks"), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machine
using bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.

When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device using
dma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unaligned
allocations if 'area-&gt;index' was left unaligned by a previous allocation
from the buffer:

 # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1649-1653/7168 (0x98328800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1653-1657/7168 (0x9832a800)

This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) because
swiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindly
returns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,
therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.

Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to any
additional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximum
of the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking care
to ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.

This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to the
inclusion of ~PAGE_MASK in 'iotlb_align_mask' for large allocations and
resulting in alignment requirements exceeding swiotlb_max_mapping_size().</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:36:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35815 | fs/aio: Check IOCB_AIO_RW before the struct aio_kiocb conversion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35815</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Define the __io_aw() hook as mmiowb()

Commit fb24ea52f78e0d595852e ("drivers: Remove explicit invocations of
mmiowb()") remove all mmiowb() in drivers, but it says:

"NOTE: mmiowb() has only ever guaranteed ordering in conjunction with
spin_unlock(). However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch with
the corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so there
is a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectly
relying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-free
synchronisation."

The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than a
spinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. We
can add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says he
doesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example of
mutex protected mmio.

So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,
and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, so
we solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()
hook as mmiowb(). And we no longer need to override queued_spin_unlock()
so use the generic definition.

Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak ordering
architectures such as LoongArch:

misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice on suspend/resume

When not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will call
lis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned off
by the runtime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup and
the device is runtime-suspended at this point then it is not turned
back on to serve as a wakeup source.

Before commit b1b9f7a49440 ("misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Add missing setting
of the reg_ctrl callback"), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed to disable
the regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twice ok.

Now that poweroff() correctly disables the regulators, doing this twice
triggers a WARN() in the regulator core:

unbalanced disables for regulator-dummy
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 92 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2999 _regulator_disable
...

Fix lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() to not call poweroff() a second time if
already runtime-suspended and add a poweron() call when necessary to
make wakeup work.

lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues, with an added weirness that
it always powers on the device if it is runtime suspended, after which
the first runtime-resume will call poweron() again, causing the enabled
count for the regulator to increase by 1 every suspend/resume. These
unbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause the regulator to never
be turned off and trigger the following WARN() on driver unbind:

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1724 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2396 _regulator_put

usb: gadget: ncm: Fix handling of zero block length packets

While connecting to a Linux host with CDC_NCM_NTB_DEF_SIZE_TX
set to 65536, it has been observed that we receive short packets,
which come at interval of 5-10 seconds sometimes and have block
length zero but still contain 1-2 valid datagrams present.

According to the NCM spec:

"If wBlockLength = 0x0000, the block is terminated by a
short packet. In this case, the USB transfer must still
be shorter than dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize. If
exactly dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize bytes are sent,
and the size is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize for the
given pipe, then no ZLP shall be sent.

wBlockLength= 0x0000 must be used with extreme care, because
of the possibility that the host and device may get out of
sync, and because of test issues.

wBlockLength = 0x0000 allows the sender to reduce latency by
starting to send a very large NTB, and then shortening it when
the sender discovers that there’s not sufficient data to justify
sending a large NTB"

However, there is a potential issue with the current implementation,
as it checks for the occurrence of multiple NTBs in a single
giveback by verifying if the leftover bytes to be processed is zero
or not. If the block length reads zero, we would process the same
NTB infintely because the leftover bytes is never zero and it leads
to a crash. Fix this by bailing out if block length reads zero.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 13:37:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35826 | block: Fix page refcounts for unaligned buffers in __bio_release_pages()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35826</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix deadlock with fiemap and extent locking

While working on the patchset to remove extent locking I got a lockdep
splat with fiemap and pagefaulting with my new extent lock replacement
lock.

This deadlock exists with our normal code, we just don't have lockdep
annotations with the extent locking so we've never noticed it.

Since we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration
we have the chance of pagefaulting.  Because we hold the extent lock for
the entire range we could mkwrite into a range in the file that we have
mmap'ed.  This would deadlock with the following stack trace

[&lt;0&gt;] lock_extent+0x28d/0x2f0

[&lt;0&gt;] do_syscall_64+0x94/0x1a0
[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76

I wrote an fstest to reproduce this deadlock without my replacement lock
and verified that the deadlock exists with our existing locking.

To fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of
the fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we
are when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in
the middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents
because we know what offset we were on before.

The only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the
delalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent
range so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're
checking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.

With this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:33:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35785 | tee: optee: Fix kernel panic caused by incorrect error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35785</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend

1) commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread") remove
   MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from __md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that
   dm-raid relies on __md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread
   indirectly. Fix this problem by adding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in
   md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread() is only used for
   dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() to
   md_stop_writes().
2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that sync thread is frozen,
   it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can't stop the
   running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after seting the
   flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used.
3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that writes are stopped, use
   it as condition for md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't
   look correct. Consider that reentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing,
   always call md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend().
4) raid_message can set/clear the flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime,
   and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared while the array is suspended,
   new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this by disallow
   raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend.

Note that after commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread"), the
test shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(),
and with previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the
test will still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this
patch, the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4
is corrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to
dm-raid456 that will be fixed in following patches.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:34:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5045 | SourceCodester Online Birth Certificate Management System admin file access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5045</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Birth Certificate Management System 1.0.

x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type

On 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input
value is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get
lost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical
address to provide a virtual address for.

One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), where
the GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bit
bit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly into
pfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addresses
above the 1TB range due to the above.

Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that
might cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,
instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to the
expected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.

While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, other
archs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances like
this, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:

  e48866647b48 ("ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()")

A C inline function is even better though.

media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts

The driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupt
handlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISP
is powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the
ISP registers.

This can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:
Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will
hang.

Fix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail
out from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:34:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27432 | net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27432</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation

We found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,
admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.
After dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag
allocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request
waiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the
request maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As
fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we
need a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held
by keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we
failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I
think we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:34:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27436 | ALSA: usb-audio: Stop parsing channels bits when all channels are found.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27436</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back

In the commit d73ef2d69c0d ("rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks
IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE length"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logic
in the function `rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check
the length of the IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment
removed the `break` statement and led to an error logic of the flags
writing back at the end of this function.

if (have_flags)

    // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!!

Before the mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.
However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will let
the attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could cause
overflow writes.

This patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save the NLA pointer
that points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve the mentioned
error logic.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27415 | netfilter: bridge: confirm multicast packets before passing them up the stack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27415</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: bridge: confirm multicast packets before passing them up the stack

conntrack nf_confirm logic cannot handle cloned skbs referencing
the same nf_conn entry, which will happen for multicast (broadcast)
frames on bridges.

 Example:
    macvlan0
       |
      br0
     /  \
  ethX    ethY

 ethX (or Y) receives a L2 multicast or broadcast packet containing
 an IP packet, flow is not yet in conntrack table.

 1. skb passes through bridge and fake-ip (br_netfilter)Prerouting.
    -&gt; skb-&gt;_nfct now references a unconfirmed entry
 2. skb is broad/mcast packet. bridge now passes clones out on each bridge
    interface.
 3. skb gets passed up the stack.
 4. In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb
    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.

    The clone skb-&gt;_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the
    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.
 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.

The Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.

This race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that
case later steps perform skb_clone() with skb-&gt;_nfct already confirmed (in
hash table).  This works fine.

But such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the
packets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.

Pablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful
nat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call
conntrack again.

This doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat
transformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting
via 'sabotage_in' hook.

Work around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN
time, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.

The downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.

Alternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with
unconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this
opens up other problems, for example:

-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4
-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5

For multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be
created, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.

Users should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic
NOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass
them, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,
so user-visible behaviour would change.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27416 | Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix handling of HCI_EV_IO_CAPA_REQUEST</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27416</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: ncm: Avoid dropping datagrams of properly parsed NTBs

It is observed sometimes when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11
as host, at some instances, the gadget_giveback has one byte appended at
the end of a proper NTB. When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for
any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending
bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the
second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that
were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.

Adding a few custom traces showed the following:
[002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==&gt; 0
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10
[002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames

In this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024.
The rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of
all datagrams in rx_list.

Same is case with packets of size 2048:
[002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==&gt; 0
[002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800

Lecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming
in from PC:

 Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)
 - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)
 --- Packet 4063861
       Data(1024 bytes)
       Duration(2.117us) Idle(14.700ns) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)
 --- Packet 4063863
       Data(1 byte)
       Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)

According to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero,
because the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the
size of transfer to be expected. However, there are in-market NCM devices
that rely on ZLP as long as the wBlockLength is multiple of wMaxPacketSize.
To deal with such devices, it pads an extra 0 at end so the transfer is no
longer multiple of wMaxPacketSize.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:48:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27406 | lib/Kconfig.debug: TEST_IOV_ITER depends on MMU</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27406</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Users who ran Sunshine versions 0.17.0 through 0.22.2 as a service on Windows may be impacted when terminating the service if an attacked placed a file named `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program.bat`, or `C:\Program.cmd` on the user's computer. This attack vector isn't exploitable unless the user has manually loosened ACLs on the system drive. If the user's system locale is not English, then the name of the executable will likely vary. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. Alternatively, ensure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level directory `C:`. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected directories.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 18:26:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5023 | Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability in ConsoleMe via Limited Git command RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5023</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in Netflix ConsoleMe allows Command Injection.This issue affects ConsoleMe: before 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 18:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1417 | Local Code Injection Vulnerability in AuthPoint Password Manager App for macOS Safari</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1417</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in WatchGuard AuthPoint Password Manager on MacOS allows an a adversary with local access to execute code under the context of the AuthPoint Password Manager application.

The product allows users to configure authorization checks as shell commands through the tac_plus.cfg configuration file. These are executed when a client sends an authorization request with a username that has pre-authorization directives configured. However, it is possible to inject additional commands into these checks because strings from TACACS+ packets are used as command-line arguments. If the installation lacks a a pre-shared secret (there is no pre-shared secret by default), then the injection can be triggered without authentication. (The attacker needs to know a username configured to use a pre-authorization command.) NOTE: this is related to CVE-2023-45239 but the issue is in the original Shrubbery product, not Meta's fork.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 16:20:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34760 | WordPress Magazine Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.6 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34760</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WPBlockart Magazine Blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Magazine Blocks: from n/a through 1.3.6.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:57:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34751 | WordPress Order Export &amp;amp; Order Import for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;=  2.4.9 - PHP Object Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34751</link><description>Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in WebToffee Order Export &amp; Order Import for WooCommerce.This issue affects Order Export &amp; Order Import for WooCommerce: from n/a through 2.4.9.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:57:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34805 | WordPress iframe plugin &amp;lt;= 5.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34805</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Webvitaly iFrame allows Stored XSS.This issue affects iFrame: from n/a through 5.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:57:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34808 | WordPress JCH Optimize plugin &amp;lt;= 4.2.0 - Path Traversal vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34808</link><description>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in Samuel Marshall JCH Optimize.This issue affects JCH Optimize: from n/a through 4.2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4956 | Nexus Repository 3 - Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4956</link><description>Path Traversal in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 allows an unauthenticated attacker to read system files.

slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34273 | njwt up to v0.4.0 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution in the Parser.prototype.parse method.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34273</link><description>njwt up to v0.4.0 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution in the Parser.prototype.parse method.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35176 | REXML contains a denial of service vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35176</link><description>REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby.

Prior to version 0.0.49, the Minder REST ingester is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via an attacker-controlled REST endpoint that can crash the Minder server. The REST ingester allows users to interact with REST endpoints to fetch data for rule evaluation. When fetching data with the REST ingester, Minder sends a request to an endpoint and will use the data from the body of the response as the data to evaluate against a certain rule. If the response is sufficiently large, it can drain memory on the machine and crash the Minder server. The attacker can control the remote REST endpoints that Minder sends requests to, and they can configure the remote REST endpoints to return responses with large bodies. They would then instruct Minder to send a request to their configured endpoint that would return the large response which would crash the Minder server. Version 0.0.49 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35187 | Stalwart Mail Server has privilege escalation by design</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35187</link><description>Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0, attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system. Usually, system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore, other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user, but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way, so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server, but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system, as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability, may be vulnerable.

other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used
to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range
32-bit code would be able to set them to.

When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,
the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so
involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves
a certain amount of translation of the values.

Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a
consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 13:43:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31142 | x86: Incorrect logic for BTC/SRSO mitigations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31142</link><description>Because of a logical error in XSA-407 (Branch Type Confusion), the
