bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) &gt; (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58100 | bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   --&gt;    bpf_prog_is_offloaded
      bpf_prog_is_offloaded           check_cfg
      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env-&gt;ops
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_btf_trace
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_name
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_proto
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;dst_trampoline
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;mod
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_attach_type
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_prog_type
- prog-&gt;expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58237 | bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58237</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers

Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate
packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call
invalidates packet pointers.

Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes
use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for
global sub-programs, such that the following program could be
rejected:

    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	bpf_tail_call_static(sk, &amp;amp;jmp_table, 0);
    	return 0;
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
    	... make p valid ...
    	tail_call(sk);
    	*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */
    	...
    }

The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that
can invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with
tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4316 | Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests eve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4316</link><description>Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests even if disallowed by the configured policy via specific user interface actions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 14:13:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45751 | SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullnam...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45751</link><description>SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullname text field.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 13:49:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28168 | Outsystems Multiple File Upload &lt; 3.1.0 is vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload.

vmxnet3: Fix malformed packet sizing in vmxnet3_process_xdp

vmxnet3 driver's XDP handling is buggy for packet sizes using ring0 (that
is, packet sizes between 128 - 3k bytes).

We noticed MTU-related connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-
balancing in case of vmxnet3 as NIC underneath. A simple curl to a HTTP
backend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large
packet sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)
while others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.

In fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the
node with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire
for the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been
152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes
was padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we
saw user/payload data from prior processed packets).

We only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and
the backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request
got dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even
though the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to
the MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let
the curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the
padding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).

Commit e127ce7699c1 ("vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom") was too eager
to also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd-&gt;len to rbi-&gt;len. It really needs
to stick to rcd-&gt;len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.
The latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and
it indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp-&gt;{data,data_end}
parts. For e127ce7699c1 ("vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom") the
relevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the
xdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp-&gt;frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on
the wire looks good again.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 11:48:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4226 | PHPGurukul Cyber Cafe Management System add-computer.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4226</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in PHPGurukul Cyber Cafe Management System 1.0.

When creating a default app with the "mojo generate app" tool, a weak secret is written to the application's configuration file using the insecure rand() function, and used for authenticating and protecting the integrity of the application's sessions. This may allow an attacker to brute force the application's session keys.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 10:19:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3815 | SurveyJS &amp;lt;= 1.12.32 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via id Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3815</link><description>The SurveyJS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.32 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
