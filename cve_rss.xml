Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for customizing behavior, and includes ConfigProvider plugins in order to manipulate these configurations. Apache Kafka also provides FileConfigProvider, DirectoryConfigProvider, and EnvVarConfigProvider implementations which include the ability to read from disk or environment variables.
In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use these ConfigProviders to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables.

In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products.
This issue affects Apache Kafka Clients: from 2.3.0 through 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.0.


Users with affected applications are recommended to upgrade kafka-clients to version &gt;=3.8.0, and set the JVM system property "org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none".
Users of Kafka Connect with one of the listed ConfigProvider implementations specified in their worker config are also recommended to add appropriate "allowlist.pattern" and "allowed.paths" to restrict their operation to appropriate bounds.


For users of Kafka Clients or Kafka Connect in environments that trust users with disk and environment variable access, it is not recommended to set the system property.
For users of the Kafka Broker, Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0, Kafka Streams, and Kafka command-line tools, it is not recommended to set the system property.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 08:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10268 | MP3 Audio Player – Music Player, Podcast Player &amp;amp; Radio by Sonaar &amp;lt;= 5.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sonaar_audioplayer Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10268</link><description>The MP3 Audio Player – Music Player, Podcast Player &amp; Radio by Sonaar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's sonaar_audioplayer shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

The reporting functionality in Graylog allows the creation and scheduling of reports which contain dashboard widgets displaying individual log messages or metrics aggregated from fields of multiple log messages. This functionality, as included in Graylog 6.1.0 &amp; 6.1.1, is vulnerable to information leakage triggered by multiple concurrent report rendering requests from authorized users. When multiple report renderings are requested at the same start time, the headless browser instance used to render the PDF will be reused. Depending on the timing, either a check for the browser instance "freshness" hits, resulting in an error instead of the report being returned, or one of the concurrent report rendering requests "wins" and this report is returned for all report rendering requests that do not return an error. This might lead to one user getting the report of a different user, potentially leaking indexed log messages or aggregated data that this user normally has no access to. This problem is fixed in Graylog 6.1.2. There is no known workaround besides disabling the reporting functionality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50804 | Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Micro-star International MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50804</link><description>Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Micro-star International MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the Device_DeviceID.dat.bak file within the C:\ProgramData\MSI\One Dragon Center\Data folder</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50849 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Rules" functionality in WordServer 11.8.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary cod...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50849</link><description>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Rules" functionality in WordServer 11.8.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52304 | aiohttp vulnerable to request smuggling due to incorrect parsing of chunk extensions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52304</link><description>aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.

Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:25:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52431 | WordPress WP Video Robot plugin &amp;lt;= 1.20.0 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52431</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Pressaholic WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer allows SQL Injection.This issue affects WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer: from n/a through 1.20.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:47:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52435 | WordPress Premium Packages – Sell Digital Products Securely plugin &amp;lt;= 5.9.3 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52435</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in W3 Eden, Inc.
