Versions prior to 1.1.1 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The scraping engine could be exploited by crafting a malicious site that redirects to a local IP address. This allowed exfiltration of local network resources through the API. The cloud service was patched on December 27th, 2024, and the maintainers have checked that no user data was exposed by this vulnerability. Scraping engines used in the open sourced version of Firecrawl were patched on December 29th, 2024, except for the playwright services which the maintainers have determined to be un-patchable. All users of open-source software (OSS) Firecrawl should upgrade to v1.1.1. As a workaround, OSS Firecrawl users should supply the playwright services with a secure proxy. A proxy can be specified through the `PROXY_SERVER` env in the environment variables. Please refer to the documentation for instructions. Ensure that the proxy server one is using is setup to block all traffic going to link-local IP addresses.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 18:40:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56801 | Tasklists has Blind SQL Injection in /ajax/reorder.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56801</link><description>Tasklists provides plugin tasklists for GLPI.

An open redirect vulnerability has been identified in the verify email endpoint of all versions of Better Auth prior to v1.1.6, potentially allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites. This issue affects users relying on email verification links generated by the library. The verify email callback endpoint accepts a `callbackURL` parameter. Unlike other verification methods, email verification only uses JWT to verify and redirect without proper validation of the target domain. The origin checker is bypassed in this scenario because it only checks for `POST` requests. An attacker can manipulate this parameter to redirect users to arbitrary URLs controlled by the attacker. Version 1.1.6 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 16:59:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56733 | Password Pusher Allows Session Token Interception Leading to Potential Hijacking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56733</link><description>Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing session hijacking. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the user's session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability hinges on the attacker's ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, or via direct access to the victim's device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized access.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 16:52:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56517 | LGSL has a reflected XSS at /lgsl_files/lgsl_list.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56517</link><description>LGSL (Live Game Server List) provides online status lists for online video games.

nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done

Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads
leaving garbage in res.replen:
- nfs3_read_done() copies that into server-&gt;read_hdrsize; from there
  nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests.
- nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()
  which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages, so that rq_rcv_buf
  contains a ridiculous len.
- This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()
  eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming
  data into entirely the wrong place.

This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads
when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back
to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this
issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3
server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 11:37:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56741 | apparmor: test: Fix memory leak for aa_unpack_strdup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56741</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leak

In reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned
to the local "options". options is then used in with strsep() to find
spaces:

  while ((name = strsep(&amp;amp;options, " ")) != NULL) {

If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(),
so the subsequent kfree(options) doesn't free the memory allocated via
kstrndup().

Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is
preserved.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 11:37:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56746 | fbdev: sh7760fb: Fix a possible memory leak in sh7760fb_alloc_mem()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56746</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

While the first suspect is the dst_cache, explicitly tracking the dst
owing the last device reference via probes proved such dst is held by
the nexthop in the originating fib6_info.

Similar to commit f5b51fe804ec ("ipv6: route: purge exception on

disconnecting a to-be-removed device from a live ipv6 dst: move the
fib6_info cleanup into ip6_dst_ifdown().

Tested running:

./pmtu.sh cleanup_ipv6_exception

in a tight loop for more than 400 iterations with no spat, running an
unpatched kernel  I observed a splat every ~10 iterations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 11:37:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56752 | drm/nouveau/gr/gf100: Fix missing unlock in gf100_gr_chan_new()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56752</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.

The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any

netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING

In fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the
bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a
situation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been
detected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as
follows:

  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]
fscache_perform_lookup
  fscache_create_volume
                        fscache_perform_lookup
                          fscache_create_volume
			                        fscache_create_volume_work
                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume
                                                  clear_and_wake_up_bit
    test_and_set_bit
                            test_and_set_bit
                              goto maybe_wait
      goto no_wait

In the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1
enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting
process. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the
-wait- process indefinitely.

In commit 3288666c7256 ("fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in
fscache_create_volume_work()"), barriers were added to similar operations
in fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.

By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to
fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 11:37:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56756 | nvme-pci: fix freeing of the HMB descriptor table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56756</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-pci: fix freeing of the HMB descriptor table

The HMB descriptor table is sized to the maximum number of descriptors
that could be used for a given device, but __nvme_alloc_host_mem could
break out of the loop earlier on memory allocation failure and end up
using less descriptors than planned for, which leads to an incorrect
size passed to dma_free_coherent.

In practice this was not showing up because the number of descriptors
tends to be low and the dma coherent allocator always allocates and
frees at least a page.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 11:37:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13008 | code-projects Responsive Hotel Site newsletter.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13008</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in code-projects Responsive Hotel Site 1.0 and classified as critical.

the bvecs array is set up, so fix this by moving sparse_ext allocation
a bit earlier.  Also, make a similar adjustment in __ceph_sync_read()

udmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path

In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a
dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handling
in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about
the containing dma_buf.

This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; though
that doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.

Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we
can give it different error handling.

Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21
("udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios"); but the memory leak
seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 08:57:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56713 | net: netdevsim: fix nsim_pp_hold_write()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56713</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ionic: no double destroy workqueue

There are some FW error handling paths that can cause us to
try to destroy the workqueue more than once, so let's be sure
we're checking for that.

The case where this popped up was in an AER event where the
handlers got called in such a way that ionic_reset_prepare()
and thus ionic_dev_teardown() got called twice in a row.
The second time through the workqueue was already destroyed,
and destroy_workqueue() choked on the bad wq pointer.

We didn't hit this in AER handler testing before because at
that time we weren't using a private workqueue.  Later we
replaced the use of the system workqueue with our own private
workqueue but hadn't rerun the AER handler testing since then.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 08:57:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56715 | ionic: Fix netdev notifier unregister on failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56715</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mscc: ocelot: fix incorrect IFH SRC_PORT field in ocelot_ifh_set_basic()

Packets injected by the CPU should have a SRC_PORT field equal to the
CPU port module index in the Analyzer block (ocelot-&gt;num_phys_ports).

The blamed commit copied the ocelot_ifh_set_basic() call incorrectly
from ocelot_xmit_common() in net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c. Instead of calling
with "x", it calls with BIT_ULL(x), but the field is not a port mask,
but rather a single port index.

[ side note: this is the technical debt of code duplication :( ]

The error used to be silent and doesn't appear to have other
user-visible manifestations, but with new changes in the packing
library, it now fails loudly as follows:

net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops

Commit 66600fac7a98 ("net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap
for non-paged SKB data") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s
members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().

The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to
dma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that
the dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value
returned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment
later, this is not the case when priv-&gt;dma_cap.addr64 &gt; 32 as "des"
is offset by proto_hdr_len.

This causes problems such as:

  dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failed

and with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:

  DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes]

Fix this by maintaining "des" as the original DMA cookie, and use
tso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().

io_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.

Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close
a DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case
