Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version &lt; `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:28:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47179 | RSSHub&amp;#x27;s `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47179</link><description>RSSHub is an RSS network. Prior to commit 64e00e7, RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning, which could have lead to a full repository takeover. Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow. As of commit 64e00e7, this scenario has been addressed and the RSSHub repository is no longer vulnerable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8118 | Grafana alerting wrong permission on datasource rule write endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8118</link><description>In Grafana, the wrong permission is applied to the alert rule write API endpoint, allowing users with permission to write external alert instances to also write alert rules.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:49:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45984 | A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject ma...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45984</link><description>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the Donor List is viewed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45987 | Projectworld Online Voting System Version 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via voter.php.

Starting in version 1.11 and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `fetchurl.nix&gt;` did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `fetchurl.nix&gt;` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature. Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `&lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;` work in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix 2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39577 | Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements use...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39577</link><description>Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability.

Prior to version 1.3.0, given a number of preconditions, the `highest_available` setting will incorrectly assume that the identity’s highest available AAL is `aal1` even though it really is `aal2`. This means that the `highest_available` configuration will act as if the user has only one factor set up, for that particular user. This means that they can call the settings and whoami endpoint without a `aal2` session, even though that should be disallowed. An attacker would need to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user who has only OTP for login enabled and who has an incorrect `available_aal` value stored, to exploit this vulnerability. All other aspects of the session (e.g. the session’s aal) are not impacted by this issue. On the Ory Network, only 0.00066% of registered users were affected by this issue, and most of those users appeared to be test users. Their respective AAL values have since been updated and they are no longer vulnerable to this attack. Version 1.3.0 is not affected by this issue. As a workaround, those who require MFA should disable the passwordless code login method. If that is not possible, check the sessions `aal` to identify if the user has `aal1` or `aal2`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45374 | goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin Weak Password Requirements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45374</link><description>In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are

This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.

Archetype integration testing creates a file
called ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml
This file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,
which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains
credentials.

When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information, specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication, may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system, consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk, in monitoring systems, or in logging services.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 21:27:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51157 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive inform...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51157</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the Emp Name parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 19:15:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46488 | sqlite-vec v0.1.1 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the npy_token_next function.

through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
missing.

Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but
are not limited to
- - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the
  same page (4k on x86),
- - INTx lines.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45817 | x86: Deadlock in vlapic_error()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45817</link><description>In x86's APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) architecture,
error conditions are reported in a status register.  Furthermore, the OS
can opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.

It is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,
which generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.

This case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion
itself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only
generate an interrupt when a new status bit becomes set.

However, the lock protecting this state in Xen will try to be taken
recursively, and deadlock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9169 | litespeed cache &amp;lt;= 6.4.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9169</link><description>The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin debug settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "maintenance mode" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time. Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 07:10:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8290 | WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible &amp;lt;= 6.7.12 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8290</link><description>The WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.12 via the WCFM_Customers_Manage_Controller::processing function due to missing validation on the ID user controlled key.

Prior to version 0.41.0, if a user on macOS has granted Cursor access to the camera or microphone, any program that is run on the machine is able to access the camera or the microphone without explicitly being granted access, through a DyLib Injection using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. The usage of `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` allows an external dynamic library to be injected into the application using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. 
Moreover, the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` allows the application to use the host camera and `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` allows the application to use the microphone. This means that untrusted code that is executed on the user's machine can access the camera or the microphone, if the user has already given permission for Cursor to do so. In version 0.41.0, the entitlements have been split by process: the main process gets the camera and microphone entitlements, but not the DyLib entitlements, whereas the extension host process gets the DyLib entitlements but not the camera or microphone entitlements. As a workaround, do not explicitly give Cursor the permission to access the camera or microphone if untrusted users can run arbitrary commands on the affected machine.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26690 | File Upload vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via File Manager/Editor component in t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26690</link><description>File Upload vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via File Manager/Editor component in the vendor or admin menu.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26691 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted zip file when inst...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26691</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted zip file when installing a new add-on.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:58:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42797 | An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability was found in /music/ajax.php?action=delete_playlist in Kashipara Music Management System v1.0.

Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allow authenticated attackers with 'Sys.Audit' or 'VM.Monitor' privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API.
When handling the result from a request handler before returning it to the user, the handle_api2_request function will check for the ‘download’ or ‘data’-&gt;’download’ objects inside the request handler call response object. If present, handle_api2_request will read a local file defined by this object and return it to the user.
Two endpoints were identified which can control the object returned by a request handler sufficiently that the ’download’ object is defined and user controlled. This results in arbitrary file read.
The privileges of this file read can result in full compromise of the system by various impacts such as disclosing sensitive files allowing for privileged session forgery.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 07:29:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8103 | WP Category Dropdown &amp;lt;= 1.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via align Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8103</link><description>The WP Category Dropdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'align' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
