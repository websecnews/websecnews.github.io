  *  Use of Solr's "RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin config (see security.json) that specifies multiple "roles"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list (see security.json) that uses one or more of the following pre-defined permission rules: "config-read", "config-edit", "schema-read", "metrics-read", or "security-read".
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list that doesn't define the "all" pre-defined permission
  *  A networking setup that allows clients to make unfiltered network requests to Solr. (i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)

Users can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the "all" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an "admin" or other privileged role.  Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22444 | Apache Solr: Insufficient file-access checking in standalone core-creation requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22444</link><description>The "create core" API of Apache Solr 8.6 through 9.10.0 lacks sufficient input validation on some API parameters, which can cause Solr to check the existence of and attempt to read file-system paths that should be disallowed by Solr's  "allowPaths" security setting https://https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuring-solr-xml.html#the-solr-element .  These read-only accesses can allow users to create cores using unexpected configsets if any are accessible via the filesystem.  On Windows systems configured to allow UNC paths this can additionally cause disclosure of NTLM "user" hashes. 

Solr deployments are subject to this vulnerability if they meet the following criteria:
  *  Solr is running in its "standalone" mode.
  *  Solr's "allowPath" setting is being used to restrict file access to certain directories.
  *  Solr's "create core" API is exposed and accessible to untrusted users.  This can happen if Solr's  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/rule-based-authorization-plugin.html  is disabled, or if it is enabled but the "core-admin-edit" predefined permission (or an equivalent custom permission) is given to low-trust (i.e. non-admin) user roles.

Users can mitigate this by enabling Solr's RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (if disabled) and configuring a permission-list that prevents untrusted users from creating new Solr cores.  Users should also upgrade to Apache Solr 9.10.1 or greater, which contain fixes for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22977 | net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22977</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue

skbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,
[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.
[2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is
enabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace
via sock_recv_errqueue() -&gt; put_cmsg().

The crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()
   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]
2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone
[3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp
reporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE)
5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr-&gt;ee from skb-&gt;cb
[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no
   usercopy whitelist [5]

When cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the
socket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb-&gt;cb
via put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:

The crash offset 296 corresponds to skb2-&gt;cb within skbuff_fclones:
  - sizeof(struct sk_buff) = 232 - offsetof(struct sk_buff, cb) = 40 -
  offset of skb2.cb in fclones = 232 + 40 = 272 - crash offset 296 =
  272 + 24 (inside sock_exterr_skb.ee)

This patch uses a local stack variable as a bounce buffer to avoid the hardened usercopy check failure.

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset

`qfq_class-&gt;leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0` does not imply that the class
itself is active.

Two qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens
when:

1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and

2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get()
/ qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function
tc_new_tfilter.

When packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared
leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ
qdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters
qfq_reset() with its own q-&gt;q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf
qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate
an inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:

The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.




Root causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g.,  execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.




ImpactThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the 

--commit-hash parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:

  *  Run any shell command.
  *  Exfiltrate environment variables.
  *  Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.

Mitigation
  *  Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.
  *  Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.
  *  Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a supported major version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:58:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21922 | No english

By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files. This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, leading to potential system compromise.
This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55131 | A flaw in Node.js's buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations are interrupted, when using the `vm` module wit...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55131</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations are interrupted, when using the `vm` module with the timeout option. Under specific timing conditions, buffers allocated with `Buffer.alloc` and other `TypedArray` instances like `Uint8Array` may contain leftover data from previous operations, allowing in-process secrets like tokens or passwords to leak or causing data corruption. While exploitation typically requires precise timing or in-process code execution, it can become remotely exploitable when untrusted input influences workload and timeouts, leading to potential confidentiality and integrity impact.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55132 | A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55132</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process has only read permissions. Unlike `utimes()`, `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks, which means file metadata can be modified in read-only directories. This behavior could be used to alter timestamps in ways that obscure activity, reducing the reliability of logs. This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59464 | A memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buff...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59464</link><description>A memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buffer. When applications call `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)`, each certificate field leaks memory, allowing remote clients to trigger steady memory growth through repeated TLS connections. Over time this can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59465 | A malformed `HTTP/2 HEADERS` frame with oversized, invalid `HPACK` data can cause Node.js to crash by triggering an unhandled `TLSSocket` er...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59465</link><description>A malformed `HTTP/2 HEADERS` frame with oversized, invalid `HPACK` data can cause Node.js to crash by triggering an unhandled `TLSSocket` error `ECONNRESET`. Instead of safely closing the connection, the process crashes, enabling a remote denial of service. This primarily affects applications that do not attach explicit error handlers to secure sockets, for example:
```
server.on('secureConnection', socket =&gt; {
  socket.on('error', err =&gt; {
    console.log(err)
  })
})

Instead of reaching `process.on('uncaughtException')`, the process terminates, making the crash unrecoverable. Applications that rely on `AsyncLocalStorage` (v22, v20) or `async_hooks.createHook()` (v24, v22, v20) become vulnerable to denial-of-service crashes triggered by deep recursion under specific conditions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21636 | A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21636</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabled. Even without `--allow-net`, attacker-controlled inputs (such as URLs or socketPath options) can connect to arbitrary local sockets via net, tls, or undici/fetch. This breaks the intended security boundary of the permission model and enables access to privileged local services, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exposure, or local code execution.

* The issue affects users of the Node.js permission model on version v25.

In the moment of this vulnerability, network permissions (`--allow-net`) are still in the experimental phase.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21637 | A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallba...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21637</link><description>A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallback` are in use. Synchronous exceptions thrown during these callbacks bypass standard TLS error handling paths (tlsClientError and error), causing either immediate process termination or silent file descriptor leaks that eventually lead to denial of service. Because these callbacks process attacker-controlled input during the TLS handshake, a remote client can repeatedly trigger the issue. This vulnerability affects TLS servers using PSK or ALPN callbacks across Node.js versions where these callbacks throw without being safely wrapped.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66692 | A buffer over-read in the PublicKey::verify() method of Binance - Trust Wallet Core before commit 5668c67 allows attackers to cause a Denial...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66692</link><description>A buffer over-read in the PublicKey::verify() method of Binance - Trust Wallet Core before commit 5668c67 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66902 | An input validation issue in in Pithikos websocket-server v.0.6.4 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause unexpect...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66902</link><description>An input validation issue in in Pithikos websocket-server v.0.6.4 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause unexpected server behavior via the websocket_server/websocket_server.py, WebSocketServer._message_received components.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0622 | Open 5GS WebUI uses a hard-coded JWT signing key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0622</link><description>Open 5GS WebUI uses a hard-coded JWT signing key (change-me) whenever the environment variable JWT_SECRET_KEY is unset</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1245 | CVE-2026-1245</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1245</link><description>A code injection vulnerability in the binary-parser library prior to version 2.3.0 allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution when untrusted values are used in parser field names or encoding parameters.

An attacker can exploit this by sending repeated subscription requests with arbitrarily large or invalid filter payloads. Each request causes memory to be allocated for the malformed topic filter, but the broker does not free the associated memory, leading to unbounded heap growth and potential denial of service under sustained attack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36115 | Multiple vulnerabilities were addressed in IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36115</link><description>IBM Sterling Connect:Express Adapter for Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2.0.00 through 5.2.0.12 does not disallow the session id after use which could allow an authenticated user to impersonate another user on the system.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:56:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36396 | Security vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Application Gateway</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36396</link><description>IBM Application Gateway 23.10 through 25.09 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

This is due to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations` system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. This is a Race Condition which enables Arbitrary File Overwrite. This vulnerability affects users and systems using node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+). Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. The patch in version 7.5.4 updates `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')` and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`. As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:21:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1195 | MineAdmin JWT Token refresh data authenticity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1195</link><description>A weakness has been identified in MineAdmin 1.x/2.x.

The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:21:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15466 | Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid &amp;lt;= 3.6.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary Gallery Management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15466</link><description>The Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.9.

Prior to version 1.13.2, unauthenticated requests could be proxied to remote environment agents, allowing access to remote environment resources without authentication. The environment proxy middleware handled `/api/environments/{id}/...` requests for remote environments before authentication was enforced. When the environment ID was not local, the middleware proxied the request and attached the manager-held agent token, even if the caller was unauthenticated. This enabled unauthenticated access to remote environment operations (e.g., listing containers, streaming logs, or other agent endpoints). An unauthenticated attacker could access and manipulate remote environment resources via the proxy, potentially leading to data exposure, unauthorized changes, or service disruption.

Prior to version 2.55.0, the JSONAuth. Auth function contains a logic flaw that allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate valid usernames by measuring the response time of the /api/login endpoint. The vulnerability exists due to a "short-circuit" evaluation in the authentication logic. When a username is not found in the database, the function returns immediately. However, if the username does exist, the code proceeds to verify the password using bcrypt (users.CheckPwd), which is a computationally expensive operation designed to be slow. This difference in execution path creates a measurable timing discrepancy.

A vulnerability present in version 1.7.65 and poetntially earlier versions allows unauthenticated users to bypass the mandatory authentication check in the roleBasedAuthMiddleware. By simply not providing an authentication cookie (making req.user undefined), a request is incorrectly passed through to downstream handlers. All users running MyTube with loginEnabled: true are impacted. This flaw allows an attacker to access and modify application settings via /api/settings, change administrative and visitor passwords, and access other protected routes that rely on this specific middleware. The problem is patched in v1.7.66. MyTube maintainers recommend all users upgrade to at least version v1.7.64 immediately to secure their instances. The fix ensures that the middleware explicitly blocks requests if a user is not authenticated, rather than defaulting to next(). Those who cannot upgrade immediately can mitigate risk by restricting network access by usi a firewall or reverse proxy (like Nginx) to restrict access to the /api/ endpoints to trusted IP addresses only or, if they are comfortable editing the source code, manually patch by locating roleBasedAuthMiddleware and ensuring that the logic defaults to an error (401 Unauthorized) when req.user is undefined, instead of calling next().</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:34:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1174 | birkir prime GraphQL Alias graphql resource consumption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1174</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in birkir prime up to 0.4.0.beta.0.

Starting in version 1.7.0 and prior to version 1.12.0, Wings does not consider SQLite max parameter limit when processing activity log entries allowing for low privileged user to trigger a condition that floods the panel with activity records. After Wings sends activity logs to the panel it deletes the processed activity entries from the wings SQLite database. However, it does not consider the max parameter limit of SQLite, 32766 as of SQLite 3.32.0. If wings attempts to delete more than 32766 entries from the SQLite database in one query, it triggers an error (SQL logic error: too many SQL variables (1)) and does not remove any entries from the database. These entries are then indefinitely re-processed and resent to the panel each time the cron runs. By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can trigger a situation where wings will keep uploading the same activity data to the panel repeatedly (growing each time to include new activity) until the panels' database server runs out of disk space.

Pterodactyl implements rate limits that are applied to the total number of resources (e.g. databases, port allocations, or backups) that can exist for an individual server. These resource limits are applied on a per-server basis, and validated during the request cycle. However, in versions prior to 1.12.0, it is possible for a malicious user to send a massive volume of requests at the same time that would create more resources than the server is allotted. This is because the validation occurs early in the request cycle and does not lock the target resource while it is processing. As a result sending a large volume of requests at the same time would lead all of those requests to validate as not using any of the target resources, and then all creating the resources at the same time. As a result a server would be able to create more databases, allocations, or backups than configured. A malicious user is able to deny resources to other users on the system, and may be able to excessively consume the limited allocations for a node, or fill up backup space faster than is allowed by the system.

Starting in version 23.05 and prior to version 26.05, when using the default configuration of Tandoor Recipes, specifically using SQLite and default `MEDIA_ROOT`, the full database file may be externally accessible, potentially on the Internet. The root cause is that the NixOS module configures the working directory of Tandoor Recipes, as well as the value of `MEDIA_ROOT`, to be `/var/lib/tandoor-recipes`. This causes Tandoor Recipes to create its `db.sqlite3` database file in the same directory as `MEDIA_ROOT` causing it to be accessible without authentication through HTTP like any other media file. This is the case when using `GUNICORN_MEDIA=1` or when using a web server like nginx to serve media files. NixOS 26.05 changes the default value of `MEDIA_ROOT` to a sub folder of the data directory. This only applies to configurations with `system.stateVersion` &gt;= 26.05. For older configurations, one of the workarounds should be applied instead. NixOS 25.11 has received a backport of this patch, though it doesn't fix this vulnerability without user intervention. A recommended workaround is to move `MEDIA_ROOT` into a subdirectory. Non-recommended workarounds include switching to PostgreSQL or disallowing access to `db.sqlite3`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:22:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23878 | HotCRP vulnerable to exposure of submitted documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23878</link><description>HotCRP is conference review software.

In versions 2025.9.0 through 2025.12.6, an integer overflow in the API component's protobuf decoder allows denial-of-service attacks when API encryption is not used. The bounds check `ptr + field_length &gt; end` in `components/api/proto.cpp` can overflow when a malicious client sends a large `field_length` value. This affects all ESPHome device platforms (ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040, LibreTiny). The overflow bypasses the out-of-bounds check, causing the device to read invalid memory and crash. When using the plaintext API protocol, this attack can be performed without authentication. When noise encryption is enabled, knowledge of the encryption key is required. Users should upgrade to ESPHome 2025.12.7 or later to receive a patch, enable API encryption with a unique key per device, and follow the Security Best Practices.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:22:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23836 | HotCRP vulnerable to remote code execution through formulas</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23836</link><description>HotCRP is conference review software.

Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0.

A security vulnerability exists in @fastify/express prior to version 4.0.3 where middleware registered with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin` instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints. The vulnerability is caused by how @fastify/express matches requests against registered middleware paths. This vulnerability is similar to, but differs from, CVE-2026-22031 because this is a different npm module with its own code.

Versions prior to 2.1.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary SQL execution through unescaped analytics export/import and permissive admin SQL import. Unauthenticated visitors can submit arbitrary path (`pa`) and referrer (`r`) values to the public tracking endpoint in src/Resources/functions/collect.php, which stores those strings verbatim in the analytics tables. The admin export logic in src/Admin/Data_Export.php writes these stored values directly into SQL INSERT statements without escaping. A crafted path such as "),('999','x');DROP TABLE wp_users;-- breaks out of the value list. When an administrator later imports that export file, the import handler in src/Admin/Data_Import.php reads the uploaded SQL with file_get_contents, performs only a superficial header check, splits on semicolons, and executes each statement via $wpdb-&gt;query with no validation of table names or statement types. Additionally, any authenticated user with manage_koko_analytics can upload an arbitrary .sql file and have it executed in the same permissive way. Combined, attacker-controlled input flows from the tracking endpoint into exported SQL and through the import execution sink, or directly via malicious uploads, enabling arbitrary SQL execution. In a worst-case scenario, attackers can achieve arbitrary SQL execution on the WordPress database, allowing deletion of core tables (e.g., wp_users), insertion of backdoor administrator accounts, or other destructive/privilege-escalating actions. Version 2.1.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:13:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23522 | Lobe Chat has IDOR in Knowledge Base File Removal that Allows Cross User File Deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23522</link><description>LobeChat is an open source chat application platform.

Prior to version 68.0, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection bypass exists in WeasyPrint's `default_url_fetcher`. The vulnerability allows attackers to access internal network resources (such as `localhost` services or cloud metadata endpoints) even when a developer has implemented a custom `url_fetcher` to block such access. This occurs because the underlying `urllib` library follows HTTP redirects automatically without re-validating the new destination against the developer's security policy. Version 68.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:31:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22031 | Fastify Middie Middleware Path Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22031</link><description>@fastify/middie is the plugin that adds middleware support on steroids to Fastify.

Problem Description
When using the JDBC engine and da
When using the JDBC engine and data source functionality, if the URL parameter configured on the frontend has undergone multiple rounds of URL encoding, it may bypass the system's checks. This bypass can trigger a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to system files via JDBC parameters.

Scope of Impact


This issue affects Apache Linkis: from 1.3.0 through 1.7.0.

Severity level


moderate
Solution
Continuously check if the connection information contains the "%" character; if it does, perform URL decoding.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.




More questions about this vulnerability can be discussed here:  https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@linkis.apache.org:2025-9:cve</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:04:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59355 | Apache Linkis: Password Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59355</link><description>A vulnerability.

When org.apache.linkis.metadata.util.HiveUtils.decode() fails to perform Base64 decoding, it records the complete input parameter string in the log via logger.error(str + "decode failed", e). If the input parameter contains sensitive information such as Hive Metastore keys, plaintext passwords will be left in the log files when decoding fails, resulting in information leakage.


Affected Scope
Component: Sensitive fields in hive-site.xml (e.g., javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword) or other fields encoded in Base64.
Version: Apache Linkis 1.0.0 – 1.7.0


Trigger Conditions
The value of the configuration item is an invalid Base64 string.
Log files are readable by users other than hive-site.xml administrators.


Severity: Low
The probability of Base64 decoding failure is low.
The leakage is only triggered when logs at the Error level are exposed.

Remediation
Apache Linkis 1.8.0 and later versions have replaced the log with desensitized content.
logger.error("URL decode failed: {}", e.getMessage());   // 不再输出 str


Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:04:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1146 | SourceCodester/Patrick Mvuma Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System api_register_patient.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1146</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester/Patrick Mvuma Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System 1.0.
