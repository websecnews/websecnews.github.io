ext4: fix bug in extents parsing when eh_entries == 0 and eh_depth &gt; 0

When walking through an inode extents, the ext4_ext_binsearch_idx() function
assumes that the extent header has been previously validated.  However, there
are no checks that verify that the number of entries (eh-&gt;eh_entries) is
non-zero when depth is &gt; 0.  And this will lead to problems because the
EXT_FIRST_INDEX() and EXT_LAST_INDEX() will return garbage and result in this:

drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errors

gma_crtc_page_flip() was holding the event_lock spinlock while calling
crtc_funcs-&gt;mode_set_base() which takes ww_mutex.

The only reason to hold event_lock is to clear gma_crtc-&gt;page_flip_event
on mode_set_base() errors.

Instead unlock it after setting gma_crtc-&gt;page_flip_event and on
errors re-take the lock and clear gma_crtc-&gt;page_flip_event it
it is still set.

This fixes the following WARN/stacktrace:

Fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev() function caused by the pavgroup

The pavgroup pointer is checked on the entrance of the function but
without the lcu-&gt;lock being held. Therefore there is a race window
between dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets
pavgroup to NULL with the lcu-&gt;lock held.

The skb should not be used afterwards, as the worker may
run before the rest of our code and free the skb, leading
to a use-after-free.

Since dev_kfree_skb_any() accepts NULL make the loss of
ownership more obvious and set skb to NULL.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 13:18:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48638 | cgroup: cgroup_get_from_id() must check the looked-up kn is a directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48638</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabled

In an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc-&gt;destroy() gets
called even if qdisc-&gt;init() never succeeded, not exclusively since
commit 87b60cfacf9f ("net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation"),
but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).

The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts full
offload, because it starts off with q-&gt;flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID in
taprio_init(), then it replaces q-&gt;flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGS
parsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).

But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and this
determines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q-&gt;flags).

But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()
(a bitwise check of bit 1 in q-&gt;flags), it is invalid to call this macro
on q-&gt;flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is set
to U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true on
an invalid set of flags.

As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces an
error between setting q-&gt;flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the calling
of taprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect the
offload to be disabled when it was never enabled.

The error that we force here is to attach taprio as a non-root qdisc,
but instead as child of an mqprio root qdisc:

$ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: \

Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong
because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't
dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very
unlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.

I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be
NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:

The cause is inside kmem_cache_destroy():

kmem_cache_destroy
    acquire lock/mutex
    shutdown_cache
        schedule_work(kmem_cache_release) (if RCU flag set)
    release lock/mutex
    kmem_cache_release (if RCU flag not set)

In some certain timing, the scheduled work could be run before
the next RCU flag checking, which can then get a wrong value
and lead to double kmem_cache_release().

Fix it by caching the RCU flag inside protected area, just like 'refcnt'</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 13:18:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48650 | scsi: qla2xxx: Fix memory leak in __qlt_24xx_handle_abts()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48650</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb-&gt;mac_header

If an AF_PACKET socket is used to send packets through ipvlan and the
default xmit function of the AF_PACKET socket is changed from
dev_queue_xmit() to packet_direct_xmit() via setsockopt() with the option
name of PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, the skb-&gt;mac_header may not be reset and
remains as the initial value of 65535, this may trigger slab-out-of-bounds
bugs as following:

The root cause is:
  1. packet_snd() only reset skb-&gt;mac_header when sock-&gt;type is SOCK_RAW
     and skb-&gt;protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()

  2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb-&gt;mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()

In this case, skb-&gt;mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
use "skb-&gt;head + skb-&gt;mac_header", out-of-bound access occurs.

This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 13:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48652 | ice: Fix crash by keep old cfg when update TCs more than queues</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48652</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Fix crash by keep old cfg when update TCs more than queues

There are problems if allocated queues less than Traffic Classes.

Commit a632b2a4c920 ("ice: ethtool: Prohibit improper channel config
for DCB") already disallow setting less queues than TCs.

Another case is if we first set less queues, and later update more TCs
config due to LLDP, ice_vsi_cfg_tc() will failed but left dirty
num_txq/rxq and tc_cfg in vsi, that will cause invalid pointer access.

gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfully

When running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command
gpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25
There will be a warning trace as below:

The reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq()
function failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to release
the resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, so
the subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the above
warning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irq
after the IRQ register successfully.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 13:18:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48661 | gpio: mockup: Fix potential resource leakage when register a chip</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48661</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gem: Really move i915_gem_context.link under ref protection

i915_perf assumes that it can use the i915_gem_context reference to
protect its i915-&gt;gem.contexts.list iteration. However, this requires
that we do not remove the context from the list until after we drop the
final reference and release the struct. If, as currently, we remove the
context from the list during context_close(), the link.next pointer may
be poisoned while we are holding the context reference and cause a GPF:

What happens is the following:

1) The cleaner kthread tries to start a transaction to delete an unused
   block group, but the metadata reservation can not be satisfied right
   away, so a reservation ticket is created and it starts the async
   metadata reclaim task (fs_info-&gt;async_reclaim_work);

2) Writeback for all the filler inodes with an i_size of 2K starts
   (generic/562 creates a lot of 2K files with the goal of filling
   metadata space). We try to create an inline extent for them, but we
   fail when trying to insert the inline extent with -ENOSPC (at
   cow_file_range_inline()) - since this is not critical, we fallback
   to non-inline mode (back to cow_file_range()), reserve extents

MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value) structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections, a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However, the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not, so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently, the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication, and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended, which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround, disable the boot record functionality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:17:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32887 | Reflected XSS in sidekiq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32887</link><description>Sidekiq is simple, efficient background processing for Ruby. Sidekiq is reflected XSS vulnerability. The value of substr parameter is reflected in the response without any encoding, allowing an attacker to inject Javascript code into the response of the application.  An attacker could exploit it to target users of the Sidekiq Web UI. Moreover, if other applications are deployed on the same domain or website as Sidekiq, users of those applications could also be affected, leading to a broader scope of compromise. Potentially compromising their accounts, forcing the users to perform sensitive actions, stealing sensitive data, performing CORS attacks, defacement of the web application, etc. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.4.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:17:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31601 | An issue in Beijing Panabit Network Software Co., Ltd Panalog big data analysis platform v. 20240323 and before allows attackers to execute ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31601</link><description>An issue in Beijing Panabit Network Software Co., Ltd Panalog big data analysis platform v. 20240323 and before allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the exportpdf.php component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:01:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4241 | Tenda W9 formQosManageDouble_auto stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4241</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda W9 1.0.0.7(4456).
