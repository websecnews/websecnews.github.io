In versions 5.2.0 through 5.12.7, there is an Open Redirect vulnerability in the trailing slash redirection logic when handling paths with double slashes. This allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary external domains by crafting URLs such as https://mydomain.com//malicious-site.com/. This increases the risk of phishing and other social engineering attacks. This affects sites that use on-demand rendering (SSR) with the Node or Cloudflare adapters. It does not affect static sites, or sites deployed to Netlify or Vercel. This issue is fixed in version 5.12.8. To work around this issue at the network level, block outgoing redirect responses with a Location header value that starts with `//`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54886 | skops: Card.get_model does not block arbitrary code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54886</link><description>skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops, joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54887 | jwe: Missing AES-GCM authentication tag validation in encrypted JWEs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54887</link><description>jwe is a Ruby implementation of the RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard. In versions 1.1.0 and below, authentication tags of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs. This puts users at risk because JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value, decrypted by observing parsing differences and the GCM internal GHASH key can be recovered. Users are affected by this vulnerability even if they do not use an AES-GCM encryption algorithm for their JWEs. As the GHASH key may have been leaked, users must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading. This issue is fixed in version 1.1.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8703 | Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System Environmental Real-Time Data Module GetAreaTrendChartData sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8703</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System 1.0.

In versions 0.8.5 and earlier, remote ZIP archives were handled in a streamwise fashion, and file entries were not reconciled against the archive's central directory. An attacker could contrive a ZIP archive that would extract with legitimate contents on some package installers, and malicious contents on others due to multiple local file entries. An attacker could  also contrive a "stacked" ZIP input with multiple internal ZIPs, which would be handled differently by different package installers. The attacker could choose which installer to target in both scenarios. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.6. To work around this issue, users may choose to set UV_INSECURE_NO_ZIP_VALIDATION=1 to revert to the previous behavior.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8702 | Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System Historical Data Query Module GetVariableByOneIDNew sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8702</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System 1.0.

Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. In affected images, the /etc/passwd file was created during build time with group-writable permissions and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:15:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8697 | agentUniverse MCPSessionManager/MCPTool/MCPToolkit StdioServerParameters os command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8697</link><description>A vulnerability was found in agentUniverse up to 0.0.18 and classified as critical.

The directory is accessible with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate files within the directory, including executable files like GPMAW3.exe, Fragment.exe, and the uninstaller GPsetup64_17028.exe. An attacker with user-level access can exploit this misconfiguration by replacing or modifying the uninstaller (GPsetup64_17028.exe) with a malicious version. While the application itself runs in the user's context, the uninstaller is typically executed with administrative privileges when an administrator attempts to uninstall the software. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin, resulting in privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:54:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50692 | FoxCMS &lt;=v1.2.5 is vulnerable to Code Execution in admin/template_file/editFile.html.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50692</link><description>FoxCMS &lt;=v1.2.5 is vulnerable to Code Execution in admin/template_file/editFile.html.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:54:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55077 | Tyler Technologies ERP Pro 9 SaaS application escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55077</link><description>Tyler Technologies ERP Pro 9 SaaS allows an authenticated user to escape the application and execute limited operating system commands within the remote Microsoft Windows environment with the privileges of the authenticated user.

QUIC connections possess a set of connection identifiers (IDs); see  Section 5.1 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Once the QUIC handshake completes, a local endpoint is responsible for issuing and retiring Connection IDs that are used by the remote peer to populate the Destination Connection ID field in packets sent from remote to local. Each Connection ID has a sequence number to ensure synchronization between peers.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by first completing a handshake and then sending a specially-crafted set of frames that trigger a connection ID retirement in the victim. When the victim attempts to send a packet containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames,  Section 19.16 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-19.6  requires that the sequence number of the retired connection ID must not be the same as the sequence number of the connection ID used by the packet. In other words, a packet cannot contain a frame that retires itself. In scenarios such as path migration, it is possible for there to be multiple active paths with different active connection IDs that could be used to retire each other. The exploit triggered an unintentional behaviour of a quiche design feature that supports retirement across paths while maintaining full connection ID synchronization, leading to an infinite loop.This issue affects quiche: from 0.15.0 before 0.24.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44779 | An issue in Ollama v0.1.33 allows attackers to delete arbitrary files via sending a crafted packet to the endpoint /api/pull.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44779</link><description>An issue in Ollama v0.1.33 allows attackers to delete arbitrary files via sending a crafted packet to the endpoint /api/pull.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50952 | openjpeg v 2.5.0 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the component /openjp2/dwt.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50952</link><description>openjpeg v 2.5.0 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the component /openjp2/dwt.c.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47188 | A vulnerability in the Mitel 6800 Series, 6900 Series, and 6900w Series SIP Phones, including the 6970 Conference Unit through 6.4 SP4, coul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47188</link><description>A vulnerability in the Mitel 6800 Series, 6900 Series, and 6900w Series SIP Phones, including the 6970 Conference Unit through 6.4 SP4, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to conduct a command injection attack due to insufficient parameter sanitization.

In versions 4.25.1 and below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the lego library and the lego cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request identifiers to network attackers. This was fixed in version 4.25.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 02:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54882 | Himmelblau&amp;#x27;s Kerberos credential cache collection is world readable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54882</link><description>Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune.

Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.

This vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need the capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network, to monitor and intercept the targeted network traffic flows, and to satisfy timing requirements in order to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user. However, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20331 | Cisco Identity Services Engine Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabiliy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20331</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on the affected device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20332 | Cisco Identity Services Engine Authorization Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20332</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify parts of the configuration on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify descriptions of files on a specific page. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid read-only Administrator&amp;nbsp;credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53786 | Microsoft Exchange Server Hybrid Deployment Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53786</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51531 | A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sage DPW v2024.12.003 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the contex...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51531</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sage DPW v2024.12.003 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser via injcting a crafted payload into the tabfields parameter at /dpw/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService.

The pic parameter is decrypted using the sys_auth($pic, 1) function, which utilizes a hard-coded key Mc_Encryption_Key (bD2voYwPpNuJ7B8), defined in the db.php file. The decrypted URL is passed to the geturl() method, which uses cURL to make a request to the URL without proper security checks. An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure. The danger of this SSRF vulnerability includes accessing internal services and local file systems through protocols like http://, ftp://, and file://, which can result in sensitive data leakage, remote code execution, privilege escalation, or full system compromise, severely affecting the system's security and stability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:34:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50233 | A vulnerability in QCMS version 6.0.5 allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files from the server due to insufficient validation of t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50233</link><description>A vulnerability in QCMS version 6.0.5 allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files from the server due to insufficient validation of the "Name" parameter in the backend template editor.

This function, responsible for converting TensorFlow weight names to PyTorch format, uses a regex pattern `/[^/]*___([^/]*)/` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerability affects versions up to 4.51.3 and is fixed in version 4.53.0. This issue can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting model conversion processes between TensorFlow and PyTorch formats.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:19:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46391 | CWE-284: Improper Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46391</link><description>CWE-284: Improper Access Control</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:27:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46388 | CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46388</link><description>CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:01:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46389 | CWE-620: Unverified Password Change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46389</link><description>CWE-620: Unverified Password Change</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:01:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46390 | CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46390</link><description>CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:01:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46387 | CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46387</link><description>CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:51:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46386 | CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46386</link><description>CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:28:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6013 | Vault LDAP MFA Enforcement Bypass When Using Username As Alias</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6013</link><description>Vault and Vault Enterprise’s (“Vault”) ldap auth method may not have correctly enforced MFA if username_as_alias was set to true and a user had multiple CNs that are equal but with leading or trailing spaces.

This insecure implementation can be exploited by a malicious user-mode application to patch the running Windows kernel and invoke arbitrary kernel functions with ring-0 privileges. The vulnerability enables local attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation and potential follow-on attacks, such as disabling security software or bypassing kernel-level protections. ThrottleStop.sys version 3.0.0.0 and possibly others are affected.
