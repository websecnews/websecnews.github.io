This issue affects Apache Traffic Control: all versions.

People with access to the management interface of the Traffic Router component could specify malicious patterns and cause unavailability.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 08:54:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0277 | HCL BigFix Mobile is affected by an insecure Content Security Policy (CSP)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0277</link><description>HCL BigFix Mobile 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to certain insecure directives within the Content Security Policy (CSP).

This issue affects all versions of Apache ActiveMQ NMS AMQP up to and including 2.3.0, when establishing connections to untrusted AMQP servers. Malicious servers could exploit unbounded deserialization logic present in the client to craft responses that may lead to arbitrary code execution on the client side.

Although version 2.1.0 introduced a mechanism to restrict deserialization via allow/deny lists, the protection was found to be bypassable under certain conditions.

In line with Microsoft’s deprecation of binary serialization in .NET 9, the project is evaluating the removal of .NET binary serialization support from the NMS API entirely in future releases.

Mitigation and Recommendations:
Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.4.0 or later, which resolves the issue. Additionally, projects depending on NMS-AMQP should migrate away from .NET binary serialization as part of a long-term hardening strategy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 08:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58075 | Arbitrary Mattermost Team can be joined by manipulating the SAML RelayState</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58075</link><description>Mattermost versions 10.11.x &lt;= 10.11.1, 10.10.x &lt;= 10.10.2, 10.5.x &lt;= 10.5.10 fail to verify a user has permission to join a Mattermost team using the original invite token which allows any attacked to join any team on a Mattermost server regardless of restrictions via manipulating the RelayState</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 08:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41443 | Guest user can discover active public channels</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41443</link><description>Mattermost versions 10.5.x &lt;= 10.5.10, 10.11.x &lt;= 10.11.2 fail to properly validate guest user permissions when accessing channel information which allows guest users to discover active public channels and their metadata via the `/api/v4/teams/{team_id}/channels/ids` endpoint</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 08:37:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41018 | SQL injection vulnerability in Sergestec&amp;#x27;s Exito</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41018</link><description>SQL injection in Sergestec's Exito v8.0.

In go-witness versions 0.8.6 and earlier and witness versions 0.9.2 and earlier the AWS attestor improperly verifies AWS EC2 instance identity documents. Verification can incorrectly succeed when a signature is not present or is empty, and when RSA signature verification fails. The attestor also embeds a single legacy global AWS public certificate and does not account for newer region specific certificates issued in 2024, making detection of forged documents difficult without additional trusted region data. An attacker able to supply or intercept instance identity document data (such as through Instance Metadata Service impersonation) can cause a forged identity document to be accepted, leading to incorrect trust decisions based on the attestation. This is fixed in go-witness 0.9.1 and witness 0.10.1. As a workaround, manually verify the included identity document, signature, and public key with standard tools (for example openssl) following AWS’s verification guidance, or disable use of the AWS attestor until upgraded.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11832 | APIs Lack Rate Limiting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11832</link><description>Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in Azure Access Technology BLU-IC2, Azure Access Technology BLU-IC4 allows Flooding.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:24:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62371 | OpenSearch Data Prepper plugins trusts all SSL certificates by default</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62371</link><description>OpenSearch Data Prepper as an open source data collector for observability data. In versions prior to 2.12.2, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins in Data Prepper trust all SSL certificates by default when no certificate path is provided. Prior to this fix, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins would automatically use a trust all SSL strategy when connecting to OpenSearch clusters if no certificate path was explicitly configured. This behavior bypasses SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks. The vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the cert parameter is not explicitly provided. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.2. As a workaround, users can add the cert parameter to their OpenSearch sink or source configuration with the path to the cluster's CA certificate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62410 | --disallow-code-generation-from-strings is not sufficient for isolating untrusted JavaScript in happy-dom</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62410</link><description>In versions before 20.0.2, it was found that --disallow-code-generation-from-strings is not sufficient for isolating untrusted JavaScript in happy-dom. The untrusted script and the rest of the application still run in the same Isolate/process, so attackers can deploy prototype pollution payloads to hijack important references like "process" in the example below, or to hijack control flow via flipping checks of undefined property. This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-61927. The vulnerability is fixed in 20.0.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62381 | sveltekit-superforms Prototype Pollution in `parseFormData` function of `formData.js`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62381</link><description>sveltekit-superforms makes SvelteKit forms a pleasure to use. sveltekit-superforms v2.27.3 and prior are susceptible to a prototype pollution vulnerability within the parseFormData function of formData.js.

Prior to 0.16.2, Frigate's export workflow allows an authenticated operator to nominate any filesystem location as the thumbnail source for a video export. Because that path is copied verbatim into the publicly served clips directory, the feature can be abused to read arbitrary files that reside on the host running Frigate. In practice, a low-privilege user with API access can pivot from viewing camera footage to exfiltrating sensitive configuration files, secrets, or user data from the appliance itself. This behavior violates the principle of least privilege for the export subsystem and turns a convenience feature into a direct information disclosure vector, with exploitation hinging on a short race window while the background exporter copies the chosen file into place before cleanup runs. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.16.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62378 | CommandKit exposes incorrect command name in context object for message command aliases</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62378</link><description>CommandKit is the discord.js meta-framework for building Discord bots. In versions 1.2.0-rc.1 through 1.2.0-rc.11, a logic flaw exists in the message command handler that affects how the commandName property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias, the ctx.commandName value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command's own run function. Although not explicitly documented, CommandKit's examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that ctx.commandName represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use ctx.commandName to reference the command being executed. Developers who assume ctx.commandName is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0-rc.12, where ctx.commandName now consistently returns the actual canonical command name regardless of the alias used to invoke it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:10:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10576 | Sound Research SECOMNService Escalation of Privilege</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10576</link><description>Potential vulnerabilities have been identified in the audio package for certain HP PC products using the Sound Research SECOMN64 driver, which might allow escalation of privilege.

Mailgen versions through 2.0.31 contain an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext emails generated with the generatePlaintext method when user generated content is supplied. The plaintext generation code attempts to strip HTML tags using a regular expression and then decodes HTML entities, but tags that include certain Unicode line separator characters are not matched and removed. These encoded tags are later decoded into valid HTML content, allowing unexpected HTML to remain in output intended to be plaintext. Projects are affected if they call Mailgen.generatePlaintext with untrusted input and then render or otherwise process the returned string in a context where HTML is interpreted. This can lead to execution of attacker supplied script in the victim’s browser. Version 2.0.32 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 17:10:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54271 | Creative Cloud Desktop | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (CWE-367)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54271</link><description>Creative Cloud Desktop versions 6.7.0.278 and earlier are affected by a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system write.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative&amp;nbsp;credentials.

This vulnerability exists because certain unencrypted credentials are stored when SIP media component logging is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials to which they may not normally have access. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII).
Note: To access the logs that are stored in the Webex Cloud or stored on the device itself, an attacker must have valid administrative credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:41:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20350 | Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Video Phone 8875 with SIP Firmware Denial of Service Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20350</link><description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 running Cisco SIP Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.

In versions 0.5.4 through 0.8.14, the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation), allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based on the presence of a sessionStorage flag, meaning it triggers immediately on first visits or in incognito/private browsing windows, with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround, users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production environment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:20:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59419 | Netty netty-codec-smtp SMTP Command Injection Vulnerability Allowing Email Forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59419</link><description>Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.128.Final and 4.2.7.Final, the SMTP codec in Netty contains an SMTP command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation for Carriage Return (\r) and Line Feed (\n) characters in user-supplied parameters. The vulnerability exists in io.netty.handler.codec.smtp.DefaultSmtpRequest, where parameters are directly concatenated into the SMTP command string without sanitization. When methods such as SmtpRequests.rcpt(recipient) are called with a malicious string containing CRLF sequences, attackers can inject arbitrary SMTP commands. Because the injected commands are sent from the server's trusted IP address, resulting emails will likely pass SPF and DKIM authentication checks, making them appear legitimate. This allows remote attackers who can control SMTP command parameters (such as email recipients) to forge arbitrary emails from the trusted server, potentially impersonating executives and forging high-stakes corporate communications. This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final.

---------------                         -----------------
1) Identical mtree is built using
   __mt_dup().

2) copy_pte_range()--&gt;
	copy_nonpresent_pte():
       The dst mm is added into the
    mmlist to be visible to the
    swapoff operation.

3) Fatal signal is sent to the parent
process(which is the current during the
fork) thus skip the duplication of the
vmas and mark the vma range with
XA_ZERO_ENTRY as a marker for this process
that helps during exit_mmap().

				     4) swapoff is tried on the
					'mm' added to the 'mmlist' as
					part of the 2.

				     5) unuse_mm(), that iterates
					through the vma's of this 'mm'
					will hit the non-NULL zero entry
					and operating on this zero entry
					as a vma is resulting into the
					oops.

The proper fix would be around not exposing this partially-valid tree to
others when droping the mmap lock, which is being solved with [1].  A
simpler solution would be checking for MMF_UNSTABLE, as it is set if
mm_struct is not fully initialized in dup_mmap().

Thanks to Liam/Lorenzo/David for all the suggestions in fixing this
issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39993 | media: rc: fix races with imon_disconnect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39993</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The iMON driver improperly releases the usb_device reference in
imon_disconnect without coordinating with active users of the
device.

Specifically, the fields usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 are not
protected by the users counter (ictx-&gt;users). During probe,
imon_init_intf0 or imon_init_intf1 increments the usb_device
reference count depending on the interface. However, during
disconnect, usb_put_dev is called unconditionally, regardless of
actual usage.

As a result, if vfd_write or other operations are still in
progress after disconnect, this can lead to a use-after-free of
the usb_device pointer.

Guard access to usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 after disconnect by
checking ictx-&gt;disconnected in all writer paths. Add early return
with -ENODEV in send_packet(), vfd_write(), lcd_write() and
display_open() if the device is no longer present.

Set and read ictx-&gt;disconnected under ictx-&gt;lock to ensure memory
synchronization. Acquire the lock in imon_disconnect() before setting
the flag to synchronize with any ongoing operations.

Ensure writers exit early and safely after disconnect before the USB
core proceeds with cleanup.

media: tuner: xc5000: Fix use-after-free in xc5000_release

The original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in xc5000_release(), which
does not guarantee that the delayed work item timer_sleep has fully
completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios
where xc5000_release() may free the xc5000_priv while timer_sleep is still
active and attempts to dereference the xc5000_priv.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (release thread)                 | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
xc5000_release()                       | xc5000_do_timer_sleep()
  cancel_delayed_work()                |
  hybrid_tuner_release_state(priv)     |
    kfree(priv)                        |
                                       |   priv = container_of() // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the timer_sleep is properly canceled before the xc5000_priv memory
is deallocated.

A deadlock concern was considered: xc5000_release() is called in a process
context and is not holding any locks that the timer_sleep work item might
also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant is safe here.

This bug was initially identified through static analysis.

media: i2c: tc358743: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by orphan timer in probe

The state-&gt;timer is a cyclic timer that schedules work_i2c_poll and
delayed_work_enable_hotplug, while rearming itself. Using timer_delete()
fails to guarantee the timer isn't still running when destroyed, similarly
cancel_delayed_work() cannot ensure delayed_work_enable_hotplug has
terminated if already executing. During probe failure after timer
initialization, these may continue running as orphans and reference the
already-freed tc358743_state object through tc358743_irq_poll_timer.

ALSA: usb-audio: fix race condition to UAF in snd_usbmidi_free

The previous commit 0718a78f6a9f ("ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at
removal") patched a UAF issue caused by the error timer.

However, because the error timer kill added in this patch occurs after the
endpoint delete, a race condition to UAF still occurs, albeit rarely.

Additionally, since kill-cleanup for urb is also missing, freed memory can
be accessed in interrupt context related to urb, which can cause UAF.

Therefore, to prevent this, error timer and urb must be killed before
freeing the heap memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39998 | scsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39998</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow

A buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the
buffer "buf" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in
/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with
size LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).

snprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name
(hba-&gt;hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev-&gt;
dev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string
length may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.

Since snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have been
written (the length of %s/%sn ), this value may exceed the buffer length
(256 bytes) passed to memcpy(), this will ultimately cause function
memcpy reporting a buffer overflow error.

An additional check of the return value of snprintf() can avoid this
buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39999 | blk-mq: fix blk_mq_tags double free while nr_requests grown</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39999</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix blk_mq_tags double free while nr_requests grown

In the case user trigger tags grow by queue sysfs attribute nr_requests,
hctx-&gt;sched_tags will be freed directly and replaced with a new
allocated tags, see blk_mq_tag_update_depth().

The problem is that hctx-&gt;sched_tags is from elevator-&gt;et-&gt;tags, while
et-&gt;tags is still the freed tags, hence later elevator exit will try to
free the tags again, causing kernel panic.

Fix this problem by replacing et-&gt;tags with new allocated tags as well.

Noted there are still some long term problems that will require some
refactor to be fixed thoroughly[1].

iommufd: Fix race during abort for file descriptors

fput() doesn't actually call file_operations release() synchronously, it
puts the file on a work queue and it will be released eventually.

This is normally fine, except for iommufd the file and the iommufd_object
are tied to gether. The file has the object as it's private_data and holds
a users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as
the file is.

When the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it
will fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This
causes a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to
decrement the users refcount.

Fix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call
__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before
kfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object
implementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file
pointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.

If the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users
refcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.

It is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an
issue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().

The UAF looks like this:

fbcon: fix integer overflow in fbcon_do_set_font

Fix integer overflow vulnerabilities in fbcon_do_set_font() where font
size calculations could overflow when handling user-controlled font
parameters.

The vulnerabilities occur when:
1. CALC_FONTSZ(h, pitch, charcount) performs h * pith * charcount
   multiplication with user-controlled values that can overflow.
2. FONT_EXTRA_WORDS * sizeof(int) + size addition can also overflow
3. This results in smaller allocations than expected, leading to buffer
   overflows during font data copying.

Add explicit overflow checking using check_mul_overflow() and
check_add_overflow() kernel helpers to safety validate all size
calculations before allocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39968 | i40e: add max boundary check for VF filters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39968</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

futex: Prevent use-after-free during requeue-PI

syzbot managed to trigger the following race:

                                   requeue_pi_wake_futex()
                                     futex_requeue_pi_complete()
                                      /* preempt */

         * timeout/ signal wakes T1 *

   futex_requeue_pi_wakeup_sync() // Q_REQUEUE_PI_LOCKED
   futex_hash_put()

                                     wake_up_state(q-&gt;task, TASK_NORMAL);

In this scenario futex_wait_requeue_pi() is able to leave without using
futex_q::lock_ptr for synchronization.

This can be prevented by reading futex_q::task before updating the
futex_q::requeue_state. A reference on the task_struct is not needed
because requeue_pi_wake_futex() is invoked with a spinlock_t held which
implies a RCU read section.

Even if T1 terminates immediately after, the task_struct will remain valid
during T2's wake_up_state().  A READ_ONCE on futex_q::task before
futex_requeue_pi_complete() is enough because it ensures that the variable
is read before the state is updated.

Read futex_q::task before updating the requeue state, use it for the
following wakeup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39978 | octeontx2-pf: Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39978</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nexthop: Forbid FDB status change while nexthop is in a group

The kernel forbids the creation of non-FDB nexthop groups with FDB
nexthops:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 via 192.0.2.1 fdb
 # ip nexthop add id 2 group 1
 Error: Non FDB nexthop group cannot have fdb nexthops.

And vice versa:

 # ip nexthop add id 3 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1
 # ip nexthop add id 4 group 3 fdb
 Error: FDB nexthop group can only have fdb nexthops.

However, as long as no routes are pointing to a non-FDB nexthop group,
the kernel allows changing the type of a nexthop from FDB to non-FDB and
vice versa:

 # ip nexthop add id 5 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1
 # ip nexthop add id 6 group 5
 # ip nexthop replace id 5 via 192.0.2.2 fdb
 # echo $?
 0

This configuration is invalid and can result in a NPD [1] since FDB
nexthops are not associated with a nexthop device:

 # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 6
 # ping 198.51.100.1

Fix by preventing nexthop FDB status change while the nexthop is in a
group:

 # ip nexthop add id 7 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1
 # ip nexthop add id 8 group 7
 # ip nexthop replace id 7 via 192.0.2.2 fdb

After commit e6d5dbdd20aa ("xdp: add multi-buff support for xdp running in
generic mode"), the original skb may be freed in skb_pp_cow_data() when

can: mcba_usb: populate ndo_change_mtu() to prevent buffer overflow

Sending an PF_PACKET allows to bypass the CAN framework logic and to
directly reach the xmit() function of a CAN driver. The only check
which is performed by the PF_PACKET framework is to make sure that
skb-&gt;len fits the interface's MTU.

Unfortunately, because the mcba_usb driver does not populate its
net_device_ops-&gt;ndo_change_mtu(), it is possible for an attacker to
configure an invalid MTU by doing, for example:

  $ ip link set can0 mtu 9999

After doing so, the attacker could open a PF_PACKET socket using the
ETH_P_CANXL protocol:

	socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_CANXL))

to inject a malicious CAN XL frames. For example:

	struct canxl_frame frame = {
		.flags = 0xff,
		.len = 2048,
	};

The CAN drivers' xmit() function are calling can_dev_dropped_skb() to
check that the skb is valid, unfortunately under above conditions, the
malicious packet is able to go through can_dev_dropped_skb() checks:

  1. the skb-&gt;protocol is set to ETH_P_CANXL which is valid (the
     function does not check the actual device capabilities).

  2. the length is a valid CAN XL length.

And so, mcba_usb_start_xmit() receives a CAN XL frame which it is not
able to correctly handle and will thus misinterpret it as a CAN frame.

This can result in a buffer overflow. The driver will consume cf-&gt;len
as-is with no further checks on these lines:

	usb_msg.dlc = cf-&gt;len;

	memcpy(usb_msg.data, cf-&gt;data, usb_msg.dlc);

Here, cf-&gt;len corresponds to the flags field of the CAN XL frame. In
our previous example, we set canxl_frame-&gt;flags to 0xff. Because the
maximum expected length is 8, a buffer overflow of 247 bytes occurs!

Populate net_device_ops-&gt;ndo_change_mtu() to ensure that the
interface's MTU can not be set to anything bigger than CAN_MTU. By
fixing the root cause, this prevents the buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 08:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39986 | can: sun4i_can: populate ndo_change_mtu() to prevent buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39986</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Apache Spark versions before 4.0.0, 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption cipher for RPC communication between nodes.

When spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default), but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured, Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding), which provides encryption without authentication.

This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext, potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.


To mitigate this issue, users should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable authenticated encryption or

enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to true, which provides stronger transport security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 07:34:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11160 | WPBakery Page Builder &amp;lt;= 8.6.1 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Custom JS Module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11160</link><description>The WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom JS module in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.1.

In versions up to and including commit 781d91157cfc234a434d0bab45cbcf97894c642e, the /workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization. The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source URL that grants full access to the target user's Windows VM. This impacts all users with active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive. This issue has been patched in commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef. No known workarounds exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 22:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49552 | Adobe Connect | Cross-site Scripting (DOM-based XSS) (CWE-79)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49552</link><description>Adobe Connect versions 12.9 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by a high-privileged attacker to execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser.

In versions 2025.1.0 through 2025.10.1, the energy dashboard is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. An authenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript code into an energy entity's name field, which is then executed when any user hovers over data points in the energy dashboard graph tooltips. The vulnerability exists because entity names containing HTML are not properly sanitized before being rendered in graph tooltips. This could allow an attacker with authentication to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions. Additionally, if an energy provider (such as Tibber) supplies a malicious default name for an entity, the vulnerability can be exploited without direct user action when the default name is used. This issue has been patched in version 2025.10.2. No known workarounds exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:29:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54891 | A user with elevated privileges can inject XSS in the ACL Resource Access configuration page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54891</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Centreon Infra Monitoring (ACL Resource access configuration modules) allows Stored

Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. During artifact extraction the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name)) without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious archive entry can supply a traversal or absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction path and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary file creation or overwrite in system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence within the affected container. Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0033 | Improper access control within AMD SEV-SNP could allow an admin privileged attacker to write to the RMP during SNP initialization, potential...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0033</link><description>Improper access control within AMD SEV-SNP could allow an admin privileged attacker to write to the RMP during SNP initialization, potentially resulting in a loss of SEV-SNP guest memory integrity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56747 | Creativeitem Academy LMS up to and including 5.13 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Api_instructor controller where regul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56747</link><description>Creativeitem Academy LMS up to and including 5.13 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Api_instructor controller where regular authenticated users can access instructor-only functions without proper role validation, allowing unauthorized course creation and management.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44088 | Apache Geode: Reflected XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44088</link><description>Malicious script injection ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Apache Geode web-api (REST).

In versions before 9.1.9, a vulnerability allows arbitrary user creation, including administrative accounts, through a combination of stored SVG injection and lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with Knowledge Base edit permissions can embed a malicious SVG element containing a link in the body field of an article. When an authenticated user clicks the malicious link, they are redirected to an attacker-controlled HTML page that executes a CSRF request against the api/v1/User endpoint. If the victim is prompted for and enters their credentials, an attacker-controlled account is created with privileges determined by the CSRF payload. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.9.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10985 | OS command injection in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacke...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10985</link><description>OS command injection in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:38:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10986 | Path traversal in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10986</link><description>Path traversal in the admin panel of Ivanti EPMM before version 12.6.0.2, 12.5.0.4, and 12.4.0.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to write data in unintended locations on disk.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:38:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5946 | RCE via the poller reload feature available only to user with high privilege</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5946</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in Centreon Infra Monitoring (Poller reload setup in the configuration modules) allows OS Command Injection.
