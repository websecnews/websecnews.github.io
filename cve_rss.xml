btrfs: abort transaction on unexpected eb generation at btrfs_copy_root()

If we find an unexpected generation for the extent buffer we are cloning
at btrfs_copy_root(), we just WARN_ON() and don't error out and abort the
transaction, meaning we allow to persist metadata with an unexpected
generation. Instead of warning only, abort the transaction and return
-EUCLEAN.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39801 | usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39801</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts

This commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeout
which causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabled
and unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled.
It is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases.
The following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:

1. Connect
   =======
-&gt;dwc3_thread_interrupt
 -&gt;dwc3_ep0_interrupt
  -&gt;configfs_composite_setup
   -&gt;composite_setup
    -&gt;usb_ep_queue
     -&gt;dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
      -&gt;__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
       -&gt;__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data
        -&gt;dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

2. Disconnect
   ==========
-&gt;dwc3_thread_interrupt
 -&gt;dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt
  -&gt;dwc3_ep0_reset_state
   -&gt;dwc3_ep0_end_control_data
    -&gt;dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

In the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that control
transfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and end
transfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence and
processing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout.
This maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EP
commands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better to
remove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to
avoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39802 | lib/crypto: arm/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39802</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/crypto: arm/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts

Restore the SIMD usability check that was removed by commit 773426f4771b
("crypto: arm/poly1305 - Add block-only interface").

This safety check is cheap and is well worth eliminating a footgun.
While the Poly1305 functions should not be called when SIMD registers
are unusable, if they are anyway, they should just do the right thing
instead of corrupting random tasks' registers and/or computing incorrect
MACs.  Fixing this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.

Just use may_use_simd() instead of the original crypto_simd_usable(),
since poly1305_kunit won't rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39803 | scsi: ufs: core: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE() call from ufshcd_uic_cmd_compl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39803</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE() call from ufshcd_uic_cmd_compl()

The UIC completion interrupt may be disabled while an UIC command is
being processed. When the UIC completion interrupt is reenabled, an UIC
interrupt is triggered and the WARN_ON_ONCE(!cmd) statement is hit.
Hence this patch that removes this kernel warning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39804 | lib/crypto: arm64/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39804</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
