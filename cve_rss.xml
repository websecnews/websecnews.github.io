fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate

fuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(), does not enable page
zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).

So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page
contents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file)
before marking the page uptodate.

The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, which
makes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().

This is an information leak, but only affects systems which do not
enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the
corresponding kernel command line parameter).</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:39:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45313 | Insecure default setting for Server Pro installed via Overleaf toolkit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45313</link><description>Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. When installing Server Pro using the Overleaf Toolkit from before 2024-07-17 or legacy docker-compose.yml from before 2024-08-28, the configuration for LaTeX compiles was insecure by default, requiring the administrator to enable the security features via a configuration setting (`SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in Toolkit, `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` in legacy docker-compose/custom deployments). If these security features are not enabled then users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) when running compiles, leading to multiple file access vulnerabilities, either directly or via symlinks created during compiles. The setting has now been changed to be secure by default for new installs in the Toolkit and legacy docker-compose deployment. The Overleaf Toolkit has been updated to set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` by default for new installs. It is recommended that any existing installations using the previous default setting migrate to using sibling containers. Existing installations can set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` in `config/overleaf.rc` as a mitigation. In legacy docker-compose/custom deployments `SANDBOXED_COMPILES=true` should be used.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:13:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45311 | Denial of service in quinn-proto when using `Endpoint::retry()`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45311</link><description>Quinn is a pure-Rust, async-compatible implementation of the IETF QUIC transport protocol. As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:56:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45312 | Arbitrary language parameter can passed to `aspell` executable via spelling requests in overleaf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45312</link><description>Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro prior to version 5.0.7 (or 4.2.7 for the 4.x series) contain a vulnerability that allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell` executable running on the server.  This causes `aspell` to attempt to load  a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename. File access is limited to the scope of the overleaf server. The problem is patched in versions 5.0.7 and 4.2.7.  Previous versions can be upgraded using the Overleaf toolkit `bin/upgrade` command. Users unable to upgrade may block POST requests to `/spelling/check` via a Web Application Firewall will prevent access to the vulnerable spell check feature.  However, upgrading is advised.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:56:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45306 | heap-buffer-overflow in Vim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45306</link><description>Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verified that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of
a line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this change made it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyond the end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at
the specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact has been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch v9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45308 | MySQL &amp;amp; free URL mode allows to hide existing notes in hedgedoc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45308</link><description>HedgeDoc is an open source, real-time, collaborative, markdown notes application. When using HedgeDoc 1 with MySQL or MariaDB, it is possible to create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes. The affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is effectively hidden by the new one. When the freeURL feature is enabled (by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the `CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`), any user with the appropriate permissions can create a note with an arbitrary alias, e.g. by accessing it in the browser. When MySQL or MariaDB are used, it is possible to create a new note with an alias that matches the lower-cased ID of a different note. HedgeDoc then always presents the new note to users, as these databases perform case-insensitive matching and the lower-cased alias is found first. This issue only affects HedgeDoc instances that use MySQL or MariaDB. Depending on the permission settings of the HedgeDoc instance, the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires knowledge of the ID of the target note. Attackers could use this issue to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user, e.g. by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use this issue to prevent access to the original note, causing a denial of service. No data is lost, as the original content of the affected notes is still present in the database. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.10.0 which addresses this issue. Users unable to upgrade may disable freeURL mode which prevents the exploitation of this issue. The impact can also be limited by restricting freeURL note creation to trusted, logged-in users by enabling `requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:46:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43797 | Path Traversal in audiobookshelf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43797</link><description>audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43801 | Privilege escalation to admin from a low-privileged user via SVG upload in Jellyfin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43801</link><description>Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files, allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via "view image" in a browser), this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken, which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator. The actual attack vector is unlikely to be exploited, as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI, i.e. it is not a passive attack. The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by PR #12490, which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers, rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser. This PR has been merged and the relevant code changes are included in release version 10.9.10. All users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45305 | gix-path uses local config across repos when it is the highest scope</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45305</link><description>gix-path is a crate of the gitoxide project dealing with git paths and their conversions. `gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git` installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials to another repository's remote. In `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest scope. It is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected, users running Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.10.10. All users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28100 | Stored Cross-site Scripting leading to arbitrary actions taken on behalf of users in elabftw</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28100</link><description>eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook for research labs. By uploading specially crafted files, a regular user can create a circumstance where a visitor's browser runs arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the eLabFTW application. This can be triggered by the visitor viewing a list of experiments. Viewing this allows the malicious script to act on behalf of the visitor in any way, including the creation of API keys for persistence, or other options normally available to the user. If the user viewing the page has the sysadmin role in eLabFTW, the script can act as a sysadmin (including system configuration and extensive user management roles). Users are advised to upgrade to at least version 5.0.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:30:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42471 | Arbitrary File Write via artifact extraction in actions/artifact</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42471</link><description>actions/artifact is the GitHub ToolKit for developing GitHub Actions.  Versions of `actions/artifact` before 2.1.7 are vulnerable to arbitrary file write when using `downloadArtifactInternal`, `downloadArtifactPublic`, or `streamExtractExternal` for extracting a specifically crafted artifact that contains path traversal filenames.

A security vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.17.0 of the Halo project. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser through specific HTML and JavaScript code, potentially leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.17.0+. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:30:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45388 | Arbitrary file read in the `/api/v2/simulation` endpoint in hoverfly (`GHSL-2023-274`)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45388</link><description>Hoverfly is a lightweight service virtualization/ API simulation / API mocking tool for developers and testers. The `/api/v2/simulation` POST handler allows users to create new simulation views from the contents of a user-specified file. This feature can be abused by an attacker to read arbitrary files from the Hoverfly server. Note that, although the code prevents absolute paths from being specified, an attacker can escape out of the `hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath` base path by using `../` segments and reach any arbitrary files. This issue was found using the Uncontrolled data used in path expression CodeQL query for python. Users are advised to make sure the final path (`filepath.Join(hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath, filePath)`) is contained within the expected base path (`filepath.Join(hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath, "/")`). This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2023-274.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 16:30:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36830 | nescalante urlregex Backtracking index.js redos</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36830</link><description>A vulnerability was found in nescalante urlregex up to 0.5.0 and classified as problematic.

kcm: Serialise kcm_sendmsg() for the same socket.

syzkaller reported UAF in kcm_release(). [0]

The scenario is

  1. Thread A builds a skb with MSG_MORE and sets kcm-&gt;seq_skb.

  2. Thread A resumes building skb from kcm-&gt;seq_skb but is blocked
     by sk_stream_wait_memory()

  3. Thread B calls sendmsg() concurrently, finishes building kcm-&gt;seq_skb
     and puts the skb to the write queue

  4. Thread A faces an error and finally frees skb that is already in the
     write queue

  5. kcm_release() does double-free the skb in the write queue

When a thread is building a MSG_MORE skb, another thread must not touch it.

Let's add a per-sk mutex and serialise kcm_sendmsg().
