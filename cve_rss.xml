KVM: VMX: Do _all_ initialization before exposing /dev/kvm to userspace

Call kvm_init() only after _all_ setup is complete, as kvm_init() exposes
/dev/kvm to userspace and thus allows userspace to create VMs (and call
other ioctls).  E.g. KVM will encounter a NULL pointer when attempting to
add a vCPU to the per-CPU loaded_vmcss_on_cpu list if userspace is able to
create a VM before vmx_init() configures said list.

KVM: VMX: Reset eVMCS controls in VP assist page during hardware disabling

Reset the eVMCS controls in the per-CPU VP assist page during hardware
disabling instead of waiting until kvm-intel's module exit.  The controls
are activated if and only if KVM creates a VM, i.e. don't need to be
reset if hardware is never enabled.

Doing the reset during hardware disabling will naturally fix a potential
NULL pointer deref bug once KVM disables CPU hotplug while enabling and
disabling hardware (which is necessary to fix a variety of bugs).  If the
kernel is running as the root partition, the VP assist page is unmapped
during CPU hot unplug, and so KVM's clearing of the eVMCS controls needs
to occur with CPU hot(un)plug disabled, otherwise KVM could attempt to
write to a CPU's VP assist page after it's unmapped.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53035 | nilfs2: fix kernel-infoleak in nilfs_ioctl_wrap_copy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53035</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel-infoleak in nilfs_ioctl_wrap_copy()

The ioctl helper function nilfs_ioctl_wrap_copy(), which exchanges a
metadata array to/from user space, may copy uninitialized buffer regions
to user space memory for read-only ioctl commands NILFS_IOCTL_GET_SUINFO
and NILFS_IOCTL_GET_CPINFO.

This can occur when the element size of the user space metadata given by
the v_size member of the argument nilfs_argv structure is larger than the
size of the metadata element (nilfs_suinfo structure or nilfs_cpinfo
structure) on the file system side.

scsi: mpi3mr: Bad drive in topology results kernel crash

When the SAS Transport Layer support is enabled and a device exposed to
the OS by the driver fails INQUIRY commands, the driver frees up the memory
allocated for an internal HBA port data structure. However, in some places,
the reference to the freed memory is not cleared. When the firmware sends
the Device Info change event for the same device again, the freed memory is
accessed and that leads to memory corruption and OS crash.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53038 | scsi: lpfc: Check kzalloc() in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53038</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix potential use-after-free in work function

When a reset notify IPC message is received, the ISR schedules a work
function and passes the ISHTP device to it via a global pointer
ishtp_dev. If ish_probe() fails, the devm-managed device resources
including ishtp_dev are freed, but the work is not cancelled, causing a
use-after-free when the work function tries to access ishtp_dev. Use
devm_work_autocancel() instead, so that the work is automatically
cancelled if probe fails.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53040 | ca8210: fix mac_len negative array access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53040</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: u_audio: don't let userspace block driver unbind

In the unbind callback for f_uac1 and f_uac2, a call to snd_card_free()
via g_audio_cleanup() will disconnect the card and then wait for all
resources to be released, which happens when the refcount falls to zero.
Since userspace can keep the refcount incremented by not closing the
relevant file descriptor, the call to unbind may block indefinitely.
This can cause a deadlock during reboot, as evidenced by the following
blocked task observed on my machine:

  task:reboot  state:D stack:0   pid:2827  ppid:569    flags:0x0000000c

The issue can also be observed by opening the card with arecord and
then stopping the process through the shell before unbinding:

  # arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget -f S32_LE -c 2 -r 48000 /dev/null
  Recording WAVE '/dev/null' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Stereo

  # echo gadget.0 &gt; /sys/bus/gadget/drivers/configfs-gadget/unbind
  (observe that the unbind command never finishes)

Fix the problem by using snd_card_free_when_closed() instead, which will
still disconnect the card as desired, but defer the task of freeing the
resources to the core once userspace closes its file descriptor.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53046 | Bluetooth: Fix race condition in hci_cmd_sync_clear</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53046</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

For this case, the state machine could still send out discover
identity message later if we skip current discover_identity message.
So we should handle the received message firstly and override the pending
discover_identity message without warning in this case. Then, a delayed
send_discover work will send discover_identity message again.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53049 | usb: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change()

When ucsi_init() fails, ucsi-&gt;connector is NULL, yet in case of
ucsi_acpi we may still get events which cause the ucs_acpi code to call
ucsi_connector_change(), which then derefs the NULL ucsi-&gt;connector
pointer.

Fix this by not setting ucsi-&gt;ntfy inside ucsi_init() until ucsi_init()
has succeeded, so that ucsi_connector_change() ignores the events
because UCSI_ENABLE_NTFY_CONNECTOR_CHANGE is not set in the ntfy mask.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53050 | thunderbolt: Fix memory leak in margining</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53050</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix use-after-free bug in refresh_cache_worker()

The UAF bug occurred because we were putting DFS root sessions in
cifs_umount() while DFS cache refresher was being executed.

Make DFS root sessions have same lifetime as DFS tcons so we can avoid
the use-after-free bug is DFS cache refresher and other places that
require IPCs to get new DFS referrals on.  Also, get rid of mount
group handling in DFS cache as we no longer need it.

usb: dwc2: fix a devres leak in hw_enable upon suspend resume

Each time the platform goes to low power, PM suspend / resume routines
call: __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable -&gt; devm_add_action_or_reset().
This adds a new devres each time.
This may also happen at runtime, as dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable() can be
called from udc_start().

This can be seen with tracing:
- echo 1 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/dev/devres_log/enable
- go to low power
- cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

A new "ADD" entry is found upon each low power cycle:
... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 82a13bba devm_action_release (8 bytes)
... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 49889daf devm_action_release (8 bytes)
...

A second issue is addressed here:
- regulator_bulk_enable() is called upon each PM cycle (suspend/resume).
- regulator_bulk_disable() never gets called.

So the reference count for these regulators constantly increase, by one
upon each low power cycle, due to missing regulator_bulk_disable() call
in __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().

The original fix that introduced the devm_add_action_or_reset() call,
fixed an issue during probe, that happens due to other errors in
dwc2_driver_probe() -&gt; dwc2_core_reset(). Then the probe fails without
disabling regulators, when dr_mode == USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL.

Rather fix the error path: disable all the low level hardware in the
error path, by using the "hsotg-&gt;ll_hw_enabled" flag. Checking dr_mode
has been introduced to avoid a dual call to dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().
"ll_hw_enabled" should achieve the same (and is used currently in the
remove() routine).</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53055 | fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53055</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()

fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted
inodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring.
Since inodes that are in-use by the Landlock LSM don't get evicted until
security_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be
called *after* security_sb_delete().

This fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if
Landlock was being used on encrypted files.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53056 | scsi: qla2xxx: Synchronize the IOCB count to be in order</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53056</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: HCI: Fix global-out-of-bounds

To loop a variable-length array, hci_init_stage_sync(stage) considers
that stage[i] is valid as long as stage[i-1].func is valid.
Thus, the last element of stage[].func should be intentionally invalid
as hci_init0[], le_init2[], and others did.
However, amp_init1[] and amp_init2[] have no invalid element, letting
hci_init_stage_sync() keep accessing amp_init1[] over its valid range.
This patch fixes this by adding {} in the last of amp_init1[] and
amp_init2[].

Since the igb_disable_sriov() will call pci_disable_sriov() before
releasing any resources, the netdev core will synchronize the cleanup to
avoid any races. This patch removes the useless rtnl_(un)lock to guarantee
correctness.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53061 | ksmbd: fix possible refcount leak in smb2_open()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53061</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

During reboot all drivers PM shutdown callbacks are invoked.
In iavf_shutdown() the adapter state is changed to __IAVF_REMOVE.
In ice_shutdown() the call chain above is executed, which at some point
calls iavf_remove(). However iavf_remove() expects the VF to be in one
of the states __IAVF_RUNNING, __IAVF_DOWN or __IAVF_INIT_FAILED. If
that's not the case it sleeps forever.
So if iavf_shutdown() gets invoked before iavf_remove() the system will
hang indefinitely because the adapter is already in state __IAVF_REMOVE.

Fix this by returning from iavf_remove() if the state is __IAVF_REMOVE,
as we already went through iavf_shutdown().</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53065 | perf/core: Fix perf_output_begin parameter is incorrectly invoked in perf_event_bpf_output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53065</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PPTT: Fix to avoid sleep in the atomic context when PPTT is absent

Commit 0c80f9e165f8 ("ACPI: PPTT: Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage")
enabled to map PPTT once on the first invocation of acpi_get_pptt() and
never unmapped the same allowing it to be used at runtime with out the
hassle of mapping and unmapping the table. This was needed to fetch LLC
information from the PPTT in the cpuhotplug path which is executed in
the atomic context as the acpi_get_table() might sleep waiting for a
mutex.

However it missed to handle the case when there is no PPTT on the system
which results in acpi_get_pptt() being called from all the secondary
CPUs attempting to fetch the LLC information in the atomic context
without knowing the absence of PPTT resulting in the splat like below:

We need to properly clean-up all the paired MPTCP-level
resources and be sure to release the msk last, even when
the unaccepted subflow is destroyed by the TCP internals
via inet_child_forget().

We can re-use the existing MPTCP_WORK_CLOSE_SUBFLOW infra,
explicitly checking that for the critical scenario: the
closed subflow is the MPC one, the msk is not accepted and
eventually going through full cleanup.

With such change, __mptcp_destroy_sock() is always called
on msk sockets, even on accepted ones. We don't need anymore
to transiently drop one sk reference at msk clone time.

Please note this commit depends on the parent one:

perf/x86/amd/core: Always clear status for idx

The variable 'status' (which contains the unhandled overflow bits) is
not being properly masked in some cases, displaying the following
warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 156 PID: 475601 at arch/x86/events/amd/core.c:972 amd_pmu_v2_handle_irq+0x216/0x270

This seems to be happening because the loop is being continued before
the status bit being unset, in case x86_perf_event_set_period()
returns 0. This is also causing an inconsistency because the "handled"
counter is incremented, but the status bit is not cleaned.

Move the bit cleaning together above, together when the "handled"
counter is incremented.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53074 | drm/amdgpu: fix ttm_bo calltrace warning in psp_hw_fini</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53074</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Adjust insufficient default bpf_jit_limit

We've seen recent AWS EKS (Kubernetes) user reports like the following:

  After upgrading EKS nodes from v20230203 to v20230217 on our 1.24 EKS
  clusters after a few days a number of the nodes have containers stuck
  in ContainerCreating state or liveness/readiness probes reporting the
  following error:

    Readiness probe errored: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to
    exec in container: failed to start exec "4a11039f730203ffc003b7[...]":
    OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process:
    unable to init seccomp: error loading seccomp filter into kernel:
    error loading seccomp filter: errno 524: unknown

  However, we had not been seeing this issue on previous AMIs and it only
  started to occur on v20230217 (following the upgrade from kernel 5.4 to
  5.10) with no other changes to the underlying cluster or workloads.

  We tried the suggestions from that issue (sysctl net.core.bpf_jit_limit=452534528)
  which helped to immediately allow containers to be created and probes to
  execute but after approximately a day the issue returned and the value
  returned by cat /proc/vmallocinfo | grep bpf_jit | awk '{s+=$2} END {print s}'
  was steadily increasing.

I tested bpf tree to observe bpf_jit_charge_modmem, bpf_jit_uncharge_modmem
their sizes passed in as well as bpf_jit_current under tcpdump BPF filter,
seccomp BPF and native (e)BPF programs, and the behavior all looks sane
and expected, that is nothing "leaking" from an upstream perspective.

The bpf_jit_limit knob was originally added in order to avoid a situation
where unprivileged applications loading BPF programs (e.g. seccomp BPF
policies) consuming all the module memory space via BPF JIT such that loading
of kernel modules would be prevented. The default limit was defined back in
2018 and while good enough back then, we are generally seeing far more BPF
consumers today.

Adjust the limit for the BPF JIT pool from originally 1/4 to now 1/2 of the
module memory space to better reflect today's needs and avoid more users
running into potentially hard to debug issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53077 | drm/amd/display: fix shift-out-of-bounds in CalculateVMAndRowBytes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53077</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix data corruption after failed write

When buffered write fails to copy data into underlying page cache page,
ocfs2_write_end_nolock() just zeroes out and dirties the page.  This can
leave dirty page beyond EOF and if page writeback tries to write this page
before write succeeds and expands i_size, page gets into inconsistent
state where page dirty bit is clear but buffer dirty bits stay set
resulting in page data never getting written and so data copied to the
page is lost.  Fix the problem by invalidating page beyond EOF after
failed write.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53082 | vp_vdpa: fix the crash in hot unplug with vp_vdpa</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53082</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vp_vdpa: fix the crash in hot unplug with vp_vdpa

While unplugging the vp_vdpa device, it triggers a kernel panic
The root cause is: vdpa_mgmtdev_unregister() will accesses modern

So need to change the sequence in vp_vdpa_remove

nfsd: don't replace page in rq_pages if it's a continuation of last page

The splice read calls nfsd_splice_actor to put the pages containing file
data into the svc_rqst-&gt;rq_pages array. It's possible however to get a
splice result that only has a partial page at the end, if (e.g.) the
filesystem hands back a short read that doesn't cover the whole page.

nfsd_splice_actor will plop the partial page into its rq_pages array and
return. Then later, when nfsd_splice_actor is called again, the
remainder of the page may end up being filled out. At this point,
nfsd_splice_actor will put the page into the array _again_ corrupting
the reply. If this is done enough times, rq_next_page will overrun the
array and corrupt the trailing fields -- the rq_respages and
rq_next_page pointers themselves.

If we've already added the page to the array in the last pass, don't add
it to the array a second time when dealing with a splice continuation.
This was originally handled properly in nfsd_splice_actor, but commit
91e23b1c3982 ("NFSD: Clean up nfsd_splice_actor()") removed the check
for it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53084 | drm/shmem-helper: Remove another errant put in error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53084</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/active: Fix misuse of non-idle barriers as fence trackers

Users reported oopses on list corruptions when using i915 perf with a
number of concurrently running graphics applications.  Root cause analysis
pointed at an issue in barrier processing code -- a race among perf open /
close replacing active barriers with perf requests on kernel context and
concurrent barrier preallocate / acquire operations performed during user
context first pin / last unpin.

When adding a request to a composite tracker, we try to reuse an existing
fence tracker, already allocated and registered with that composite.  The
tracker we obtain may already track another fence, may be an idle barrier,
or an active barrier.

If the tracker we get occurs a non-idle barrier then we try to delete that
barrier from a list of barrier tasks it belongs to.  However, while doing
that we don't respect return value from a function that performs the
barrier deletion.  Should the deletion ever fail, we would end up reusing
the tracker still registered as a barrier task.  Since the same structure
field is reused with both fence callback lists and barrier tasks list,
list corruptions would likely occur.

Barriers are now deleted from a barrier tasks list by temporarily removing
the list content, traversing that content with skip over the node to be
deleted, then populating the list back with the modified content.  Should
that intentionally racy concurrent deletion attempts be not serialized,
one or more of those may fail because of the list being temporary empty.

Related code that ignores the results of barrier deletion was initially
introduced in v5.4 by commit d8af05ff38ae ("drm/i915: Allow sharing the
idle-barrier from other kernel requests").  However, all users of the
barrier deletion routine were apparently serialized at that time, then the
issue didn't exhibit itself.  Results of git bisect with help of a newly
developed igt@gem_barrier_race@remote-request IGT test indicate that list
corruptions might start to appear after commit 311770173fac ("drm/i915/gt:
Schedule request retirement when timeline idles"), introduced in v5.5.

Respect results of barrier deletion attempts -- mark the barrier as idle
only if successfully deleted from the list.  Then, before proceeding with
setting our fence as the one currently tracked, make sure that the tracker
we've got is not a non-idle barrier.  If that check fails then don't use
that tracker but go back and try to acquire a new, usable one.

v3: use unlikely() to document what outcome we expect (Andi),
  - fix bad grammar in commit description.
v2: no code changes,
  - blame commit 311770173fac ("drm/i915/gt: Schedule request retirement
    when timeline idles"), v5.5, not commit d8af05ff38ae ("drm/i915: Allow

mptcp: fix UaF in listener shutdown

As reported by Christoph after having refactored the passive
socket initialization, the mptcp listener shutdown path is prone
to an UaF issue.

The msk grace period can legitly expire in between the last
reference count dropped in mptcp_subflow_queue_clean() and
the later eventual access in inet_csk_listen_stop()

After the previous patch we don't need anymore special-casing
msk listener socket cleanup: the mptcp worker will process each
of the unaccepted msk sockets.

Just drop the now unnecessary code.

Please note this commit depends on the two parent ones:

  mptcp: refactor passive socket initialization

==================================================================

The problem is that the inode contains an xattr entry with ea_inum of 15
when cleaning up an orphan inode &lt;15&gt;. When evict inode &lt;15&gt;, the reference
counting of the corresponding EA inode is decreased. When EA inode &lt;15&gt; is
found by find_inode_fast() in __ext4_iget(), it is found that the EA inode
holds the I_FREEING flag and waits for the EA inode to complete deletion.
As a result, when inode &lt;15&gt; is being deleted, we wait for inode &lt;15&gt; to
complete the deletion, resulting in an infinite loop and triggering Hung
Task. To solve this problem, we only need to check whether the ino of EA
inode and parent is the same before getting EA inode.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53090 | drm/amdkfd: Fix an illegal memory access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix an illegal memory access

In the kfd_wait_on_events() function, the kfd_event_waiter structure is
allocated by alloc_event_waiters(), but the event field of the waiter
structure is not initialized; When copy_from_user() fails in the
kfd_wait_on_events() function, it will enter exception handling to
release the previously allocated memory of the waiter structure;
Due to the event field of the waiters structure being accessed
in the free_waiters() function, this results in illegal memory access
and system crash, here is the crash log:

ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay

When mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum may change after journal
replay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded
and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new
s_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which
may trigger a null pointer dereference problem. So if s_journal_inum
changes after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and rewrite the
current journal_inum to the superblock.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53092 | interconnect: exynos: fix node leak in probe PM QoS error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53092</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Histogram values can not be strings, stacktraces, graphs, symbols,

do so.

Note, the histogram code was not prepared to handle these modifiers for
histograms and caused a bug.

drm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

The LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being removed
from an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks
currently like res-&gt;bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas
bo-&gt;resource is protected by the object lock, while *clearing* of
bo-&gt;resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means that if
we check that bo-&gt;resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU
lock we should be safe.
So perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids
dereferencing a NULL bo-&gt;resource in ttm_bo_swapout().</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53096 | interconnect: fix mem leak when freeing nodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53096</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Above issue happens as follows:

ext4_try_add_inline_entry
   __ext4_mark_inode_dirty
      ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea -&gt;i_extra_isize=32 s_want_extra_isize=44
         ext4_xattr_shift_entries
	 -&gt;after shift i_inline_off is incorrect, actually is change to 176
ext4_try_add_inline_entry
  ext4_update_inline_dir
    get_max_inline_xattr_value_size
      if (EXT4_I(inode)-&gt;i_inline_off)
	entry = (struct ext4_xattr_entry *)((void *)raw_inode +
			EXT4_I(inode)-&gt;i_inline_off);
        free += EXT4_XATTR_SIZE(le32_to_cpu(entry-&gt;e_value_size));
	-&gt;As entry is incorrect, then 'free' may be negative
   ext4_update_inline_data
      value = kzalloc(len, GFP_NOFS);
      -&gt; len is unsigned int, maybe very large, then trigger warning when
         'kzalloc()'

To resolve the above issue we need to update 'i_inline_off' after
'ext4_xattr_shift_entries()'.  We do not need to set
EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag here, since ext4_mark_inode_dirty()
already sets this flag if needed.  Setting EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA
when it is needed may trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_writepages().</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53101 | ext4: zero i_disksize when initializing the bootloader inode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53101</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: zero i_disksize when initializing the bootloader inode

If the boot loader inode has never been used before, the
EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT inode will initialize it, including setting the
i_size to 0.  However, if the "never before used" boot loader has a
non-zero i_size, then i_disksize will be non-zero, and the
inconsistency between i_size and i_disksize can trigger a kernel
warning:

Reproducer:
 1. create corrupted image and mount it:
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 200
       debugfs -wR "sif &lt;5&gt; size 25700" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img /mnt
       cd /mnt
       echo 123 &gt; file
 2. Run the reproducer program:
       posix_memalign(&amp;buf, 1024, 1024)
       fd = open("file", O_RDWR | O_DIRECT);
       ioctl(fd, EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT);
       write(fd, buf, 1024);

Fix this by setting i_disksize as well as i_size to zero when
initiaizing the boot loader inode.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53102 | ice: xsk: disable txq irq before flushing hw</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53102</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: xsk: disable txq irq before flushing hw

ice_qp_dis() intends to stop a given queue pair that is a target of xsk
pool attach/detach. One of the steps is to disable interrupts on these
queues. It currently is broken in a way that txq irq is turned off
*after* HW flush which in turn takes no effect.

ice_qp_dis():
-&gt; ice_qvec_dis_irq()
--&gt; disable rxq irq
--&gt; flush hw
-&gt; ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring()
--&gt;disable txq irq

Below splat can be triggered by following steps:
- start xdpsock WITHOUT loading xdp prog
- run xdp_rxq_info with XDP_TX action on this interface
- start traffic
- terminate xdpsock

In fact, irqs were not disabled and napi managed to be scheduled and run
while xsk_pool pointer was still valid, but SW ring of xdp_buff pointers
was already freed.

To fix this, call ice_qvec_dis_irq() after ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring(). Also
while at it, remove redundant ice_clean_rx_ring() call - this is handled
in ice_qp_clean_rings().</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53103 | bonding: restore bond&amp;#x27;s IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: restore bond's IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails

syzbot reported a warning[1] where the bond device itself is a slave and
we try to enslave a non-ethernet device as the first slave which fails
but then in the error path when ether_setup() restores the bond device
it also clears all flags. In my previous fix[2] I restored the
IFF_MASTER flag, but I didn't consider the case that the bond device
itself might also be a slave with IFF_SLAVE set, so we need to restore
that flag as well. Use the bond_ether_setup helper which does the right
thing and restores the bond's flags properly.

Steps to reproduce using a nlmon dev:
 $ ip l add nlmon0 type nlmon
 $ ip l add bond1 type bond
 $ ip l add bond2 type bond
 $ ip l set bond1 master bond2
 $ ip l set dev nlmon0 master bond1
 $ ip -d l sh dev bond1
 22: bond1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master bond2 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
 (now bond1's IFF_SLAVE flag is gone and we'll hit a warning[3] if we
  try to delete it)

net/mlx5e: Fix cleanup null-ptr deref on encap lock

During module is unloaded while a peer tc flow is still offloaded,
first the peer uplink rep profile is changed to a nic profile, and so
neigh encap lock is destroyed. Next during unload, the VF reps netdevs
are unregistered which causes the original non-peer tc flow to be deleted,
which deletes the peer flow. The peer flow deletion detaches the encap
entry and try to take the already destroyed encap lock, causing the
below trace.

Fix this by clearing peer flows during tc eswitch cleanup
(mlx5e_tc_esw_cleanup()).

nfc: st-nci: Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition

This bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove and st_nci_spi_remove.
Take st_nci_i2c_remove as an example.

In st_nci_i2c_probe, it called ndlc_probe and bound &amp;ndlc-&gt;sm_work
with llt_ndlc_sm_work.

When it calls ndlc_recv or timeout handler, it will finally call
schedule_work to start the work.

When we call st_nci_i2c_remove to remove the driver, there
may be a sequence as follows:

Fix it by finishing the work before cleanup in ndlc_remove

veth: Fix use after free in XDP_REDIRECT

Commit 718a18a0c8a6 ("veth: Rework veth_xdp_rcv_skb in order
to accept non-linear skb") introduced a bug where it tried to
use pskb_expand_head() if the headroom was less than
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM.  This however uses kmalloc to expand the head,
which will later allow consume_skb() to free the skb while is it still
in use by AF_XDP.

Previously if the headroom was less than XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM we
continued on to allocate a new skb from pages so this restores that
behavior.

net/iucv: Fix size of interrupt data

iucv_irq_data needs to be 4 bytes larger.
These bytes are not used by the iucv module, but written by
the z/VM hypervisor in case a CPU is deconfigured.

net: tunnels: annotate lockless accesses to dev-&gt;needed_headroom

IP tunnels can apparently update dev-&gt;needed_headroom
in their xmit path.

This patch takes care of three tunnels xmit, and also the
core LL_RESERVED_SPACE() and LL_RESERVED_SPACE_EXTRA()
helpers.

More changes might be needed for completeness.

net/smc: fix NULL sndbuf_desc in smc_cdc_tx_handler()

When performing a stress test on SMC-R by rmmod mlx5_ib driver
during the wrk/nginx test, we found that there is a probability
of triggering a panic while terminating all link groups.

This issue dues to the race between smc_smcr_terminate_all()
and smc_buf_create().

			smc_smcr_terminate_all

smc_buf_create
/* init */
conn-&gt;sndbuf_desc = NULL;
...

			__smc_lgr_terminate
				smc_conn_kill
					smc_close_abort
						smc_cdc_get_slot_and_msg_send

			__softirqentry_text_start
				smc_wr_tx_process_cqe
					smc_cdc_tx_handler
						READ(conn-&gt;sndbuf_desc-&gt;len);
						/* panic dues to NULL sndbuf_desc */

conn-&gt;sndbuf_desc = xxx;

This patch tries to fix the issue by always to check the sndbuf_desc
before send any cdc msg, to make sure that no null pointer is
seen during cqe processing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53111 | loop: Fix use-after-free issues</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53111</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: Fix use-after-free issues

do_req_filebacked() calls blk_mq_complete_request() synchronously or
asynchronously when using asynchronous I/O unless memory allocation fails.
Hence, modify loop_handle_cmd() such that it does not dereference 'cmd' nor
'rq' after do_req_filebacked() finished unless we are sure that the request
has not yet been completed. This patch fixes the following kernel crash:

According to the definition of sseu_dev_info, eu_mask-&gt;hsw is limited to
a maximum of GEN_MAX_SS_PER_HSW_SLICE (6) sub-slices, but
gen11_sseu_info_init() can potentially set 8 sub-slices, in the
!IS_JSL_EHL(gt-&gt;i915) case.

Fix this by reserving up to 8 slots for max_subslices in the eu_mask
struct.

i40e: Fix kernel crash during reboot when adapter is in recovery mode

If the driver detects during probe that firmware is in recovery
mode then i40e_init_recovery_mode() is called and the rest of
probe function is skipped including pci_set_drvdata(). Subsequent
i40e_shutdown() called during shutdown/reboot dereferences NULL
pointer as pci_get_drvdata() returns NULL.

To fix call pci_set_drvdata() also during entering to recovery mode.

Reproducer:
1) Lets have i40e NIC with firmware in recovery mode
2) Run reboot

PCI: s390: Fix use-after-free of PCI resources with per-function hotplug

On s390 PCI functions may be hotplugged individually even when they
belong to a multi-function device. In particular on an SR-IOV device VFs
may be removed and later re-added.

In commit a50297cf8235 ("s390/pci: separate zbus creation from
scanning") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct
zpci_bus's resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO
resources even though those resources are released and freed on
hot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when the
PCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.

One idea of fixing this use-after-free in s390 specific code that was
investigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment a PCI
function first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for
a multi-function device disappears. The problem with this however is
that due to the requirement of artificial MMIO addreesses (address
cookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies
compatible on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically
belong to the PCI function so tying their lifecycle to the function
seems more logical.

Instead a simpler approach is to remove the resources of an individually
hot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus's resource list while
keeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.

This is done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an
individual resource. Similarly the resource also needs to be removed
from the struct zpci_bus's resource list. It turns out however, that
there is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct
zpci_bus's resource list at all and instead we can simply use the
zpci_bar_struct's resource pointer directly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53124 | scsi: mpt3sas: Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53124</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Port is allocated by sas_port_alloc_num() and rphy is allocated by either
sas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc(), all of which may return
NULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.

If sas_rphy_add() returned with failure, rphy is set to NULL. We would
access the rphy in the following lines which would also result NULL pointer
access.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53125 | net: usb: smsc75xx: Limit packet length to skb-&amp;gt;len</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53125</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The logic in tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser is as follows:

msg_bytes_ready:
	copied = sk_msg_recvmsg(sk, psock, msg, len, flags);
	if (!copied) {
		wait data;
		goto msg_bytes_ready;
	}

In this case, "copied" always is 0, the infinite loop occurs.

According to the Linux system call man page, 0 should be returned in this
case. Therefore, in tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser(), if the length is 0, directly
return. Also modify several other functions with the same problem.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:00:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53134 | bnxt_en: Avoid order-5 memory allocation for TPA data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53134</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Avoid order-5 memory allocation for TPA data

The driver needs to keep track of all the possible concurrent TPA (GRO/LRO)
completions on the aggregation ring.  On P5 chips, the maximum number
of concurrent TPA is 256 and the amount of memory we allocate is order-5
on systems using 4K pages.  Memory allocation failure has been reported:

af_unix: fix struct pid leaks in OOB support

syzbot reported struct pid leak [1].

Issue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially
holds a reference on a pid.

But skb-&gt;destructor is not set (either directly or by calling
unix_scm_to_skb())

This means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak
this reference.

In this fix, I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.

ext4: Fix possible corruption when moving a directory

When we are renaming a directory to a different directory, we need to
update '..' entry in the moved directory. However nothing prevents moved
directory from being modified and even converted from the inline format
to the normal format. When such race happens the rename code gets
confused and we crash. Fix the problem by locking the moved directory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53138 | net: caif: Fix use-after-free in cfusbl_device_notify()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53138</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When unregistering a net device, unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
sets the device's reg_state to NETREG_UNREGISTERING, calls notifiers
with NETDEV_UNREGISTER, and adds the device to the todo list.

Later on, devices in the todo list are processed by netdev_run_todo().
netdev_run_todo() waits devices' reference count become 1 while
rebdoadcasting NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification.

When cfusbl_device_notify() is called with NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple
times, the parent device might be freed.  This could cause UAF.
Processing NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple times also causes inbalance of
reference count for the module.

This patch fixes the issue by accepting only first NETDEV_UNREGISTER
notification.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53139 | nfc: fdp: add null check of devm_kmalloc_array in fdp_nci_i2c_read_device_properties</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53139</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: copy last block omitted in ice_get_module_eeprom()

ice_get_module_eeprom() is broken since commit e9c9692c8a81 ("ice:
Reimplement module reads used by ethtool") In this refactor,
ice_get_module_eeprom() reads the eeprom in blocks of size 8.
But the condition that should protect the buffer overflow
ignores the last block. The last block always contains zeros.

Bug uncovered by ethtool upstream commit 9538f384b535
("netlink: eeprom: Defer page requests to individual parsers")
After this commit, ethtool reads a block with length = 1;
to read the SFF-8024 identifier value.

ext4: fix another off-by-one fsmap error on 1k block filesystems

Apparently syzbot figured out that issuing this FSMAP call:

struct fsmap_head cmd = {
	.fmh_count	= ...;
	.fmh_keys	= {
		{ .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
		{ .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
	},
...
};
ret = ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_GETFSMAP, &amp;cmd);

Produces this crash if the underlying filesystem is a 1k-block ext4
filesystem:

For GETFSMAP calls, the caller selects a physical block device by
writing its block number into fsmap_head.fmh_keys[01].fmr_device.
To query mappings for a subrange of the device, the starting byte of the
range is written to fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0].fmr_physical and the last
byte of the range goes in fsmap_head.fmh_keys[1].fmr_physical.

IOWs, to query what mappings overlap with bytes 3-14 of /dev/sda, you'd
set the inputs as follows:

	fmh_keys[0] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 3},
	fmh_keys[1] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 14},

Which would return you whatever is mapped in the 12 bytes starting at
physical offset 3.

The crash is due to insufficient range validation of keys[1] in
ext4_getfsmap_datadev.  On 1k-block filesystems, block 0 is not part of
the filesystem, which means that s_first_data_block is nonzero.
ext4_get_group_no_and_offset subtracts this quantity from the blocknr
argument before cracking it into a group number and a block number
within a group.  IOWs, block group 0 spans blocks 1-8192 (1-based)
instead of 0-8191 (0-based) like what happens with larger blocksizes.

The net result of this encoding is that blocknr &lt; s_first_data_block is
not a valid input to this function.  The end_fsb variable is set from
the keys that are copied from userspace, which means that in the above
example, its value is zero.  That leads to an underflow here:

	blocknr = blocknr - le32_to_cpu(es-&gt;s_first_data_block);

The division then operates on -1:

	offset = do_div(blocknr, EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb)) &gt;&gt;
		EXT4_SB(sb)-&gt;s_cluster_bits;

Leaving an impossibly large group number (2^32-1) in blocknr.
ext4_getfsmap_check_keys checked that keys[0

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class handling

This patch fixes a Use-After-Free vulnerability in the HFSC qdisc class
handling. The issue occurs due to a time-of-check/time-of-use condition
in hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem
or codel.

The vulnerability works as follows:
1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0)
2. It then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g.,
   codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue
3. The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding
   the class to vttree
4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes
   are in vttree

Prior to version 1.4.0, when run as a server, OPA exposes an HTTP Data API for reading and writing documents. Requesting a virtual document through the Data API entails policy evaluation, where a Rego query containing a single data document reference is constructed from the requested path. This query is then used for policy evaluation. A HTTP request path can be crafted in a way that injects Rego code into the constructed query. The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision results. Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service (DoS) attack. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0. A workaround involves having network access to OPA’s RESTful APIs being limited to `localhost` and/or trusted networks, unless necessary for production reasons.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 19:43:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46629 | Lack of access controls in the 'ate' management binary of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46629</link><description>Lack of access controls in the 'ate' management binary of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform unauthorized configuration changes for any router where 'ate' has been enabled by sending a crafted UDP packet</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 19:27:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46630 | Improper access controls in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to enable '...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46630</link><description>Improper access controls in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to enable 'ate' (a remote system management binary) by sending a /goform/ate web request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 19:27:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46631 | Improper access controls in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to enable t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46631</link><description>Improper access controls in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to enable telnet access to the router's OS by sending a /goform/telnet web request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 19:27:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46632 | Initialization vector (IV) reuse in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 may allow an attacker to discern information ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46632</link><description>Initialization vector (IV) reuse in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 may allow an attacker to discern information about or more easily decrypt encrypted messages between client and server.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 19:27:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46633 | Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an attacker to decrypt ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46633</link><description>Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows an attacker to decrypt traffic between the client and server by collecting the symmetric AES key from collected and/or observed traffic.

Prior to versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14, the contents of files in the project root that are denied by a file matching pattern can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. Only files that are under project root and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed. `server.fs.deny` can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem} as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination of slash and dot (/.).

ntfs: check overflow when iterating ATTR_RECORDs

Kernel iterates over ATTR_RECORDs in mft record in ntfs_attr_find(). 
Because the ATTR_RECORDs are next to each other, kernel can get the next
ATTR_RECORD from end address of current ATTR_RECORD, through current
ATTR_RECORD length field.

The problem is that during iteration, when kernel calculates the end
address of current ATTR_RECORD, kernel may trigger an integer overflow bug
in executing `a = (ATTR_RECORD*)((u8*)a + le32_to_cpu(a-&gt;length))`.  This
may wrap, leading to a forever iteration on 32bit systems.

This patch solves it by adding some checks on calculating end address
of current ATTR_RECORD during iteration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49763 | ntfs: fix use-after-free in ntfs_attr_find()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49763</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: fix use-after-free in ntfs_attr_find()

Patch series "ntfs: fix bugs about Attribute", v2.

This patchset fixes three bugs relative to Attribute in record:

Patch 1 adds a sanity check to ensure that, attrs_offset field in first
mft record loading from disk is within bounds.

Patch 2 moves the ATTR_RECORD's bounds checking earlier, to avoid
dereferencing ATTR_RECORD before checking this ATTR_RECORD is within
bounds.

Patch 3 adds an overflow checking to avoid possible forever loop in
ntfs_attr_find().

Without patch 1 and patch 2, the kernel triggersa KASAN use-after-free
detection as reported by Syzkaller.

Although one of patch 1 or patch 2 can fix this, we still need both of
them.  Because patch 1 fixes the root cause, and patch 2 not only fixes
the direct cause, but also fixes the potential out-of-bounds bug.


This patch (of 3):

Kernel will loads $MFT/$DATA's first mft record in
ntfs_read_inode_mount().

Yet the problem is that after loading, kernel doesn't check whether
attrs_offset field is a valid value.

To be more specific, if attrs_offset field is larger than bytes_allocated
field, then it may trigger the out-of-bounds read bug(reported as
use-after-free bug) in ntfs_attr_find(), when kernel tries to access the
corresponding mft record's attribute.

This patch solves it by adding the sanity check between attrs_offset field
and bytes_allocated field, after loading the first mft record.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:20:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49764 | bpf: Prevent bpf program recursion for raw tracepoint probes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49764</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Prevent bpf program recursion for raw tracepoint probes

We got report from sysbot [1] about warnings that were caused by
bpf program attached to contention_begin raw tracepoint triggering
the same tracepoint by using bpf_trace_printk helper that takes
trace_printk_lock lock.

The can be reproduced by attaching bpf program as raw tracepoint on
contention_begin tracepoint. The bpf prog calls bpf_trace_printk
helper. Then by running perf bench the spin lock code is forced to
take slow path and call contention_begin tracepoint.

Fixing this by skipping execution of the bpf program if it's
already running, Using bpf prog 'active' field, which is being
currently used by trampoline programs for the same reason.

Moving bpf_prog_inc_misses_counter to syscall.c because
trampoline.c is compiled in just for CONFIG_BPF_JIT option.

net/9p: use a dedicated spinlock for trans_fd

Shamelessly copying the explanation from Tetsuo Handa's suggested
patch[1] (slightly reworded):
syzbot is reporting inconsistent lock state in p9_req_put()[2],
for p9_tag_remove() from p9_req_put() from IRQ context is using
spin_lock_irqsave() on "struct p9_client"-&gt;lock but trans_fd
(not from IRQ context) is using spin_lock().

Since the locks actually protect different things in client.c and in
trans_fd.c, just replace trans_fd.c's lock by a new one specific to the
transport (client.c's protect the idr for fid/tag allocations,
while trans_fd.c's protects its own req list and request status field
that acts as the transport's state machine)</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:20:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49766 | netlink: Bounds-check struct nlmsgerr creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49766</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p/trans_fd: always use O_NONBLOCK read/write

syzbot is reporting hung task at p9_fd_close() [1], for p9_mux_poll_stop()
 from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is failing to interrupt already
started kernel_read() from p9_fd_read() from p9_read_work() and/or
kernel_write() from p9_fd_write() from p9_write_work() requests.

Since p9_socket_open() sets O_NONBLOCK flag, p9_mux_poll_stop() does not
need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write(). However, since p9_fd_open()
does not set O_NONBLOCK flag, but pipe blocks unless signal is pending,
p9_mux_poll_stop() needs to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() when
the file descriptor refers to a pipe. In other words, pipe file descriptor
needs to be handled as if socket file descriptor.

We somehow need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() on pipes.

A minimal change, which this patch is doing, is to set O_NONBLOCK flag
 from p9_fd_open(), for O_NONBLOCK flag does not affect reading/writing
of regular files. But this approach changes O_NONBLOCK flag on userspace-
supplied file descriptors (which might break userspace programs), and
O_NONBLOCK flag could be changed by userspace. It would be possible to set
O_NONBLOCK flag every time p9_fd_read()/p9_fd_write() is invoked, but still
remains small race window for clearing O_NONBLOCK flag.

If we don't want to manipulate O_NONBLOCK flag, we might be able to
surround kernel_read()/kernel_write() with set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)
and recalc_sigpending(). Since p9_read_work()/p9_write_work() works are
processed by kernel threads which process global system_wq workqueue,
signals could not be delivered from remote threads when p9_mux_poll_stop()
 from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is called. Therefore, calling
set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)/recalc_sigpending() every time would be
needed if we count on signals for making kernel_read()/kernel_write()
non-blocking.

gfs2: Check sb_bsize_shift after reading superblock

Fuzzers like to scribble over sb_bsize_shift but in reality it's very
unlikely that this field would be corrupted on its own. Nevertheless it
should be checked to avoid the possibility of messy mount errors due to
bad calculations. It's always a fixed value based on the block size so
we can just check that it's the expected value.

Tested with:

    mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock /dev/vdb
    for i in 0 -1 64 65 32 33; do
        gfs2_edit -p sb field sb_bsize_shift $i /dev/vdb
        mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test &amp;&amp; umount /mnt/test
    done

Before this patch we get a withdraw after

[   76.413681] gfs2: fsid=loop0.0: fatal: invalid metadata block

After the patch, these complaints don't appear, mount fails immediately
and we get an explanation in dmesg.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49770 | ceph: avoid putting the realm twice when decoding snaps fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49770</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading

__list_versions will first estimate the required space using the
"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_needed, &amp;amp;needed)" call and then will
fill the space using the "dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_info,
&amp;amp;iter_info)" call. Each of these calls locks the targets using the
"down_read(&amp;_lock)" and "up_read(&amp;_lock)" calls, however between the first
and second "dm_target_iterate" there is no lock held and the target
modules can be loaded at this point, so the second "dm_target_iterate"
call may need more space than what was the first "dm_target_iterate"
returned.

The code tries to handle this overflow (see the beginning of
list_version_get_info), however this handling is incorrect.

The code sets "param-&gt;data_size = param-&gt;data_start + needed" and
"iter_info.end = (char *)vers+len" - "needed" is the size returned by the
first dm_target_iterate call; "len" is the size of the buffer allocated by
userspace.

"len" may be greater than "needed"; in this case, the code will write up
to "len" bytes into the buffer, however param-&gt;data_size is set to
"needed", so it may write data past the param-&gt;data_size value. The ioctl
interface copies only up to param-&gt;data_size into userspace, thus part of
the result will be truncated.

Fix this bug by setting "iter_info.end = (char *)vers + needed;" - this
guarantees that the second "dm_target_iterate" call will write only up to
the "needed" buffer and it will exit with "DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG" if it
overflows the "needed" space - in this case, userspace will allocate a
larger buffer and retry.

Note that there is also a bug in list_version_get_needed - we need to add
"strlen(tt-&gt;name) + 1" to the needed size, not "strlen(tt-&gt;name)".</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49772 | ALSA: usb-audio: Drop snd_BUG_ON() from snd_usbmidi_output_open()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49772</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

snd_usbmidi_output_open() has a check of the NULL port with

but in reality, the NULL port may be seen when the device gives an
invalid endpoint setup at the descriptor, hence the driver skips the
allocation.  That is, the check itself is valid and snd_BUG_ON()
should be dropped from there.  Otherwise it's confusing as if it were
a real bug, as recently syzbot stumbled on it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49773 | drm/amd/display: Fix optc2_configure warning on dcn314</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49773</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/amd: Fix crash due to race between amd_pmu_enable_all, perf NMI and throttling

amd_pmu_enable_all() does:

      if (!test_bit(idx, cpuc-&gt;active_mask))
              continue;

      amd_pmu_enable_event(cpuc-&gt;events[idx]);

A perf NMI of another event can come between these two steps. Perf NMI
handler internally disables and enables _all_ events, including the one
which nmi-intercepted amd_pmu_enable_all() was in process of enabling.
If that unintentionally enabled event has very low sampling period and
causes immediate successive NMI, causing the event to be throttled,
cpuc-&gt;events[idx] and cpuc-&gt;active_mask gets cleared by x86_pmu_stop().
This will result in amd_pmu_enable_event() getting called with event=NULL
when amd_pmu_enable_all() resumes after handling the NMIs. This causes a
kernel crash:

amd_pmu_disable_all()/amd_pmu_enable_all() calls inside perf NMI handler
were recently added as part of BRS enablement but I'm not sure whether
we really need them. We can just disable BRS in the beginning and enable
it back while returning from NMI. This will solve the issue by not
enabling those events whose active_masks are set but are not yet enabled
in hw pmu.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49782 | perf: Improve missing SIGTRAP checking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49782</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Improve missing SIGTRAP checking

To catch missing SIGTRAP we employ a WARN in __perf_event_overflow(),
which fires if pending_sigtrap was already set: returning to user space
without consuming pending_sigtrap, and then having the event fire again
would re-enter the kernel and trigger the WARN.

This, however, seemed to miss the case where some events not associated
with progress in the user space task can fire and the interrupt handler
runs before the IRQ work meant to consume pending_sigtrap (and generate
the SIGTRAP).

syzbot gifted us this stack trace:

In this case, syzbot produced a program with event type
PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE and config PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK. The hrtimer
manages to fire again before the IRQ work got a chance to run, all while
never having returned to user space.

Improve the WARN to check for real progress in user space: approximate
this by storing a 32-bit hash of the current IP into pending_sigtrap,
and if an event fires while pending_sigtrap still matches the previous
IP, we assume no progress (false negatives are possible given we could
return to user space and trigger again on the same IP).</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49783 | x86/fpu: Drop fpregs lock before inheriting FPU permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49783</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Mike says:

  The splat comes from fpu_inherit_perms() being called under fpregs_lock(),
  and us reaching the spin_lock_irq() therein due to fpu_state_size_dynamic()
  returning true despite static key __fpu_state_size_dynamic having never
  been enabled.

Mike's assessment looks correct. fpregs_lock on a PREEMPT_RT kernel disables
preemption so calling spin_lock_irq() in fpu_inherit_perms() is unsafe. This
problem exists since commit

  9e798e9aa14c ("x86/fpu: Prepare fpu_clone() for dynamically enabled features").

Even though the original bug report should not have enabled the paths at
all, the bug still exists.

fpregs_lock is necessary when editing the FPU registers or a task's FP
state but it is not necessary for fpu_inherit_perms(). The only write
of any FP state in fpu_inherit_perms() is for the new child which is
not running yet and cannot context switch or be borrowed by a kernel
thread yet. Hence, fpregs_lock is not protecting anything in the new
child until clone() completes and can be dropped earlier. The siglock
still needs to be acquired by fpu_inherit_perms() as the read of the
parent's permissions has to be serialised.

scsi: zfcp: Fix double free of FSF request when qdio send fails

We used to use the wrong type of integer in 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' to cache
the FSF request ID when sending a new FSF request. This is used in case the
sending fails and we need to remove the request from our internal hash
table again (so we don't keep an invalid reference and use it when we free
the request again).

In 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' we used to cache the ID as 'int' (signed and 32
bit wide), but the rest of the zfcp code (and the firmware specification)
handles the ID as 'unsigned long'/'u64' (unsigned and 64 bit wide [s390x
ELF ABI]).  For one this has the obvious problem that when the ID grows
past 32 bit (this can happen reasonably fast) it is truncated to 32 bit
when storing it in the cache variable and so doesn't match the original ID
anymore.  The second less obvious problem is that even when the original ID
has not yet grown past 32 bit, as soon as the 32nd bit is set in the
original ID (0x80000000 = 2'147'483'648) we will have a mismatch when we
cast it back to 'unsigned long'. As the cached variable is of a signed
type, the compiler will choose a sign-extending instruction to load the 32
bit variable into a 64 bit register (e.g.: 'lgf %r11,188(%r15)'). So once
we pass the cached variable into 'zfcp_reqlist_find_rm()' to remove the
request again all the leading zeros will be flipped to ones to extend the
sign and won't match the original ID anymore (this has been observed in
practice).

If we can't successfully remove the request from the hash table again after
'zfcp_qdio_send()' fails (this happens regularly when zfcp cannot notify
the adapter about new work because the adapter is already gone during
e.g. a ChpID toggle) we will end up with a double free.  We unconditionally
free the request in the calling function when 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' fails,
but because the request is still in the hash table we end up with a stale
memory reference, and once the zfcp adapter is either reset during recovery
or shutdown we end up freeing the same memory twice.

The resulting stack traces vary depending on the kernel and have no direct
correlation to the place where the bug occurs. Here are three examples that
have been seen in practice:

  list_del corruption. next-&gt;prev should be 00000001b9d13800, but was 00000000dead4ead. (next=00000001bd131a00)

s390: avoid using global register for current_stack_pointer

Commit 30de14b1884b ("s390: current_stack_pointer shouldn't be a
function") made current_stack_pointer a global register variable like
on many other architectures. Unfortunately on s390 it uncovers old
gcc bug which is fixed only since gcc-9.1 [gcc commit 3ad7fed1cc87
("S/390: Fix PR89775. Stackpointer save/restore instructions removed")]
and backported to gcc-8.4 and later. Due to this bug gcc versions prior
to 8.4 generate broken code which leads to stack corruptions.

Current minimal gcc version required to build the kernel is declared
as 5.1. It is not possible to fix all old gcc versions, so work
around this problem by avoiding using global register variable for
current_stack_pointer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49805 | net: lan966x: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in lan966x_stats_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49805</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: don't leak tagger-owned storage on switch driver unbind

In the initial commit dc452a471dba ("net: dsa: introduce tagger-owned
storage for private and shared data"), we had a call to
tag_ops-&gt;disconnect(dst) issued from dsa_tree_free(), which is called at
tree teardown time.

There were problems with connecting to a switch tree as a whole, so this
got reworked to connecting to individual switches within the tree. In
this process, tag_ops-&gt;disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from
switch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto
changes), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with
anything.

Solve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of
dsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent
spot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we
won't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the
teardown sequence is as follows:

dsa_tree_teardown
-&gt; dsa_tree_teardown_master
   -&gt; dsa_master_teardown
      -&gt; unsets master-&gt;dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the
         ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler
-&gt; dsa_tree_teardown_ports
   -&gt; dsa_port_teardown
      -&gt; dsa_slave_destroy
         -&gt; unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()
            in unregister_netdevice_many()
-&gt; dsa_tree_teardown_switches
   -&gt; dsa_switch_teardown
      -&gt; dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol
         -&gt; finally frees the tagger-owned storage</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49809 | net/x25: Fix skb leak in x25_lapb_receive_frame()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49809</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix missing xas_retry() calls in xarray iteration

netfslib has a number of places in which it performs iteration of an xarray
whilst being under the RCU read lock.  It *should* call xas_retry() as the
first thing inside of the loop and do "continue" if it returns true in case
the xarray walker passed out a special value indicating that the walk needs
to be redone from the root[*].

Fix this by adding the missing retry checks.

[*] I wonder if this should be done inside xas_find(), xas_next_node() and
    suchlike, but I'm told that's not an simple change to effect.

This can cause an oops like that below.  Note the faulting address - this
is an internal value (|0x2) returned from xarray.

bridge: switchdev: Fix memory leaks when changing VLAN protocol

The bridge driver can offload VLANs to the underlying hardware either
via switchdev or the 8021q driver. When the former is used, the VLAN is
marked in the bridge driver with the 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'
private flag.

To avoid the memory leaks mentioned in the cited commit, the bridge
driver will try to delete a VLAN via the 8021q driver if the VLAN is not
marked with the previously mentioned flag.

When the VLAN protocol of the bridge changes, switchdev drivers are
notified via the 'SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_BRIDGE_VLAN_PROTOCOL' attribute, but
the 8021q driver is also called to add the existing VLANs with the new
protocol and delete them with the old protocol.

In case the VLANs were offloaded via switchdev, the above behavior is
both redundant and buggy. Redundant because the VLANs are already
programmed in hardware and drivers that support VLAN protocol change
(currently only mlx5) change the protocol upon the switchdev attribute
notification. Buggy because the 8021q driver is called despite these
VLANs being marked with 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'. This leads to
memory leaks [1] when the VLANs are deleted.

kcm: close race conditions on sk_receive_queue

sk-&gt;sk_receive_queue is protected by skb queue lock, but for KCM
sockets its RX path takes mux-&gt;rx_lock to protect more than just
skb queue. However, kcm_recvmsg() still only grabs the skb queue
lock, so race conditions still exist.

We can teach kcm_recvmsg() to grab mux-&gt;rx_lock too but this would
introduce a potential performance regression as struct kcm_mux can
be shared by multiple KCM sockets.

So we have to enforce skb queue lock in requeue_rx_msgs() and handle
skb peek case carefully in kcm_wait_data(). Fortunately,
skb_recv_datagram() already handles it nicely and is widely used by
other sockets, we can just switch to skb_recv_datagram() after
getting rid of the unnecessary sock lock in kcm_recvmsg() and
kcm_splice_read(). Side note: SOCK_DONE is not used by KCM sockets,
so it is safe to get rid of this check too.

I ran the original syzbot reproducer for 30 min without seeing any
issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49815 | erofs: fix missing xas_retry() in fscache mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49815</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mctp i2c: don't count unused / invalid keys for flow release

We're currently hitting the WARN_ON in mctp_i2c_flow_release:

    if (midev-&gt;release_count &gt; midev-&gt;i2c_lock_count) {
        WARN_ONCE(1, "release count overflow");

This may be hit if we expire a flow before sending the first packet it
contains - as we will not be pairing the increment of release_count
(performed on flow release) with the i2c lock operation (only
performed on actual TX).

To fix this, only release a flow if we've encountered it previously (ie,
dev_flow_state does not indicate NEW), as we will mark the flow as
ACTIVE at the same time as accounting for the i2c lock operation. We
also need to add an INVALID flow state, to indicate when we've done the
release.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49821 | mISDN: fix possible memory leak in mISDN_dsp_element_register()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49821</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache

This change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and
it solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.

Currently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed
from the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that
hugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated
instead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states,
this is effectively memory corruption.

The fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to
use a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with
EIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page,
the thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.

nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of ns_writer on remount

If a nilfs2 filesystem is downgraded to read-only due to metadata
corruption on disk and is remounted read/write, or if emergency read-only
remount is performed, detaching a log writer and synchronizing the
filesystem can be done at the same time.

In these cases, use-after-free of the log writer (hereinafter
nilfs-&gt;ns_writer) can happen as shown in the scenario below:

 Task1                               Task2
 --------------------------------    ------------------------------
 nilfs_construct_segment
   nilfs_segctor_sync
     init_wait
     init_waitqueue_entry
     add_wait_queue
     schedule
                                     nilfs_remount (R/W remount case)
				       nilfs_attach_log_writer
                                         nilfs_detach_log_writer
                                           nilfs_segctor_destroy
                                             kfree
     finish_wait
       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
         __raw_spin_lock_irqsave
           do_raw_spin_lock
             debug_spin_lock_before  &lt;-- use-after-free

While Task1 is sleeping, nilfs-&gt;ns_writer is freed by Task2.  After Task1
waked up, Task1 accesses nilfs-&gt;ns_writer which is already freed.  This
scenario diagram is based on the Shigeru Yoshida's post [1].

This patch fixes the issue by not detaching nilfs-&gt;ns_writer on remount so
that this UAF race doesn't happen.  Along with this change, this patch
also inserts a few necessary read-only checks with superblock instance
where only the ns_writer pointer was used to check if the filesystem is
read-only.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49835 | ALSA: hda: fix potential memleak in &amp;#x27;add_widget_node&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49835</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The root case here is: In function prepare_func_exit(), the callee is
not released in the abnormal scenario after "state-&gt;curframe--;". To
fix, move "state-&gt;curframe--;" to the very bottom of the function,
right when we free callee and reset frame[] pointer to NULL, as Andrii
suggested.

In addition, function __check_func_call() has a similar problem. In
the abnormal scenario before "state-&gt;curframe++;", the callee also
should be released by free_func_state().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49838 | sctp: clear out_curr if all frag chunks of current msg are pruned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49838</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

out_curr outq while this outq was empty.

Normally stream-&gt;out_curr must be set to NULL once all frag chunks of

However, in sctp_prsctp_prune_unsent() as it is not a proper dequeue,
sctp_sched_dequeue_done() is not called to do this.

This patch is to fix it by simply setting out_curr to NULL when the
last frag chunk of current msg is dequeued from out_curr stream in
sctp_prsctp_prune_unsent().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49839 | scsi: scsi_transport_sas: Fix error handling in sas_phy_add()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49839</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

On hibernating, pm core calls into related hooks in sequence like:

    .freeze
    .freeze_noirq
    .thaw_noirq
    .thaw

With .thaw_noirq hook being absent, the clock will be disabled in a
unbalanced call which results the warning above.

    imx_uart_suspend_noirq()

can: dev: fix skb drop check

In commit a6d190f8c767 ("can: skb: drop tx skb if in listen only
mode") the priv-&gt;ctrlmode element is read even on virtual CAN
interfaces that do not create the struct can_priv at startup. This
out-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN
interfaces like vcan and vxcan.

This patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper

Commit fc64623637da ("phy: qcom-qmp-combo,usb: add support for separate

separate from the PCS registers but used the wrong base when no PCS_USB
offset has been provided.

Fix the PCS_USB base used at runtime resume to prevent dereferencing a

btrfs: fix match incorrectly in dev_args_match_device

syzkaller found a failed assertion:

  assertion failed: (args-&gt;devid != (u64)-1) || args-&gt;missing, in fs/btrfs/volumes.c:6921

This can be triggered when we set devid to (u64)-1 by ioctl. In this
case, the match of devid will be skipped and the match of device may
succeed incorrectly.

Patch 562d7b1512f7 introduced this function which is used to match device.
This function contains two matching scenarios, we can distinguish them by
checking the value of args-&gt;missing rather than check whether args-&gt;devid
and args-&gt;uuid is default value.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49850 | nilfs2: fix deadlock in nilfs_count_free_blocks()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49850</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix deadlock in nilfs_count_free_blocks()

A semaphore deadlock can occur if nilfs_get_block() detects metadata
corruption while locating data blocks and a superblock writeback occurs at
the same time:

task 1                               task 2

                                         down_write(rwsem B) &lt;--
                                         nilfs_cleanup_super()
      * Detect b-tree corruption *         nilfs_set_log_cursor()
      nilfs_bmap_convert_error()             nilfs_count_free_blocks()
        __nilfs_error()                        down_read(rwsem A) &lt;--
          nilfs_set_error()
            down_write(rwsem B) &lt;--

                           *** DEADLOCK ***

Here, nilfs_get_block() readlocks rwsem A (= NILFS_MDT(dat_inode)-&gt;mi_sem)
and then calls nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig(), but if it fails due to metadata
corruption, __nilfs_error() is called from nilfs_bmap_convert_error()
inside the lock section.

Since __nilfs_error() calls nilfs_set_error() unless the filesystem is
read-only and nilfs_set_error() attempts to writelock rwsem B (=
nilfs-&gt;ns_sem) to write back superblock exclusively, hierarchical lock
acquisition occurs in the order rwsem A -&gt; rwsem B.

Now, if another task starts updating the superblock, it may writelock
rwsem B during the lock sequence above, and can deadlock trying to
readlock rwsem A in nilfs_count_free_blocks().

However, there is actually no need to take rwsem A in
nilfs_count_free_blocks() because it, within the lock section, only reads
a single integer data on a shared struct with
nilfs_sufile_get_ncleansegs().  This has been the case after commit
aa474a220180 ("nilfs2: add local variable to cache the number of clean
segments"), that is, even before this bug was introduced.

So, this resolves the deadlock problem by just not taking the semaphore in
nilfs_count_free_blocks().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49851 | riscv: fix reserved memory setup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49851</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: fix reserved memory setup

Currently, RISC-V sets up reserved memory using the "early" copy of the
device tree. As a result, when trying to get a reserved memory region
using of_reserved_mem_lookup(), the pointer to reserved memory regions
is using the early, pre-virtual-memory address which causes a kernel
panic when trying to use the buffer's name:

early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() takes no arguments as it operates on
initial_boot_params, which is populated by early_init_dt_verify(). On
RISC-V, early_init_dt_verify() is called twice. Once, directly, in
setup_arch() if CONFIG_BUILTIN_DTB is not enabled and once indirectly,
very early in the boot process, by parse_dtb() when it calls
early_init_dt_scan_nodes().

This first call uses dtb_early_va to set initial_boot_params, which is
not usable later in the boot process when
early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() is called. On arm64 for example, the
corresponding call to early_init_dt_scan_nodes() uses fixmap addresses
and doesn't suffer the same fate.

Move early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() further along the boot sequence,
after the direct call to early_init_dt_verify() in setup_arch() so that
the names use the correct virtual memory addresses. The above supposed
that CONFIG_BUILTIN_DTB was not set, but should work equally in the case
where it is - unflatted_and_copy_device_tree() also updates
initial_boot_params.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49852 | riscv: process: fix kernel info leakage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49852</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In the scenario where the macvlan mode is configured as 'source',

can: af_can: fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rx_register()

It causes NULL pointer dereference when testing as following:
(a) use syscall(__NR_socket, 0x10ul, 3ul, 0) to create netlink socket.
(b) use syscall(__NR_sendmsg, ...) to create bond link device and vxcan
    link device, and bind vxcan device to bond device (can also use
    ifenslave command to bind vxcan device to bond device).
(c) use syscall(__NR_socket, 0x1dul, 3ul, 1) to create CAN socket.
(d) use syscall(__NR_bind, ...) to bind the bond device to CAN socket.

The bond device invokes the can-raw protocol registration interface to
receive CAN packets. However, ml_priv is not allocated to the dev,
dev_rcv_lists is assigned to NULL in can_rx_register(). In this case,
it will occur the NULL pointer dereference issue.

net: gso: fix panic on frag_list with mixed head alloc types

Since commit 3dcbdb134f32 ("net: gso: Fix skb_segment splat when
splitting gso_size mangled skb having linear-headed frag_list"), it is
allowed to change gso_size of a GRO packet. However, that commit assumes
that "checking the first list_skb member suffices; i.e if either of the
list_skb members have non head_frag head, then the first one has too".

It turns out this assumption does not hold. We've seen BUG_ON being hit
in skb_segment when skbs on the frag_list had differing head_frag with
the vmxnet3 driver. This happens because __netdev_alloc_skb and
__napi_alloc_skb can return a skb that is page backed or kmalloced
depending on the requested size. As the result, the last small skb in
the GRO packet can be kmalloced.

There are three different locations where this can be fixed:

(1) We could check head_frag in GRO and not allow GROing skbs with
    different head_frag. However, that would lead to performance
    regression on normal forward paths with unmodified gso_size, where
    !head_frag in the last packet is not a problem.

(2) Set a flag in bpf_skb_net_grow and bpf_skb_net_shrink indicating
    that NETIF_F_SG is undesirable. That would need to eat a bit in
    sk_buff. Furthermore, that flag can be unset when all skbs on the
    frag_list are page backed. To retain good performance,
    bpf_skb_net_grow/shrink would have to walk the frag_list.

(3) Walk the frag_list in skb_segment when determining whether
    NETIF_F_SG should be cleared. This of course slows things down.

This patch implements (3). To limit the performance impact in
skb_segment, the list is walked only for skbs with SKB_GSO_DODGY set
that have gso_size changed. Normal paths thus will not hit it.

We could check only the last skb but since we need to walk the whole
list anyway, let's stay on the safe side.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49873 | bpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49873</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()

Some helper functions will allocate memory. To avoid memory leaks, the
verifier requires the eBPF program to release these memories by calling
the corresponding helper functions.

When a resource is released, all pointer registers corresponding to the
resource should be invalidated. The verifier use release_references() to
do this job, by apply  __mark_reg_unknown() to each relevant register.

It will give these registers the type of SCALAR_VALUE. A register that
will contain a pointer value at runtime, but of type SCALAR_VALUE, which
may allow the unprivileged user to get a kernel pointer by storing this
register into a map.

Using __mark_reg_not_init() while NOT allow_ptr_leaks can mitigate this
problem.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49874 | HID: hyperv: fix possible memory leak in mousevsc_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49874</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix general-protection-fault in ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()

When device is running and the interface status is changed, the gpf issue
is triggered. The problem triggering process is as follows:
Thread A:                           Thread B
ieee80211_runtime_change_iftype()   process_one_work()
    ...                                 ...

        sdata-&gt;bss = NULL               ...
        ...                             ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()

                                      cause gpf issue

When the interface status is changed, the sending queue continues to send
packets. After the bss is set to NULL, the bss is accessed. As a result,
this causes a general-protection-fault issue.

The following is the stack information:

KVM: Reject attempts to consume or refresh inactive gfn_to_pfn_cache

Reject kvm_gpc_check() and kvm_gpc_refresh() if the cache is inactive.
Not checking the active flag during refresh is particularly egregious, as
KVM can end up with a valid, inactive cache, which can lead to a variety
of use-after-free bugs, e.g. consuming a NULL kernel pointer or missing
an mmu_notifier invalidation due to the cache not being on the list of
gfns to invalidate.

Note, "active" needs to be set if and only if the cache is on the list
of caches, i.e. is reachable via mmu_notifier events.  If a relevant
mmu_notifier event occurs while the cache is "active" but not on the
list, KVM will not acquire the cache's lock and so will not serailize
the mmu_notifier event with active users and/or kvm_gpc_refresh().

A race between KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO and KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND
can be exploited to trigger the bug.

1. Deactivate shinfo cache:

kvm_xen_hvm_set_attr
case KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO
 kvm_gpc_deactivate
  kvm_gpc_unmap
   gpc-&gt;valid = false
   gpc-&gt;khva = NULL
  gpc-&gt;active = false

Result: active = false, valid = false

2. Cause cache refresh:

kvm_arch_vm_ioctl
case KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND
 kvm_xen_hvm_evtchn_send
  kvm_xen_set_evtchn
   kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast
    kvm_gpc_check
    return -EWOULDBLOCK because !gpc-&gt;valid
   kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast
    return -EWOULDBLOCK
   kvm_gpc_refresh
    hva_to_pfn_retry
     gpc-&gt;valid = true
     gpc-&gt;khva = not NULL

Result: active = false, valid = true

3. Race ioctl KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND against ioctl
KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO:

kvm_arch_vm_ioctl
case KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND
 kvm_xen_hvm_evtchn_send
  kvm_xen_set_evtchn
   kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast

KVM: Initialize gfn_to_pfn_cache locks in dedicated helper

Move the gfn_to_pfn_cache lock initialization to another helper and
call the new helper during VM/vCPU creation.  There are race
conditions possible due to kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_init()'s
ability to re-initialize the cache's locks.

For example: a race between ioctl(KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND) and
kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_init() leads to a corrupted shinfo gpc lock.

                (thread 1)                |           (thread 2)

  read_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;amp;gpc-&gt;lock, ...) |

Rename "cache_init" and "cache_destroy" to activate+deactivate to
avoid implying that the cache really is destroyed/freed.

Note, there more races in the newly named kvm_gpc_activate() that will
be addressed separately.

x86/tdx: Panic on bad configs that #VE on "private" memory access

All normal kernel memory is "TDX private memory".  This includes
everything from kernel stacks to kernel text.  Handling
exceptions on arbitrary accesses to kernel memory is essentially
impossible because they can happen in horribly nasty places like
kernel entry/exit.  But, TDX hardware can theoretically _deliver_
a virtualization exception (#VE) on any access to private memory.

But, it's not as bad as it sounds.  TDX can be configured to never
deliver these exceptions on private memory with a "TD attribute"
called ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE.  The guest has no way to *set* this
attribute, but it can check it.

Ensure ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE is set in early boot.  panic() if it
is unset.  There is no sane way for Linux to run with this
attribute clear so a panic() is appropriate.

There's small window during boot before the check where kernel
has an early #VE handler. But the handler is only for port I/O
and will also panic() as soon as it sees any other #VE, such as
a one generated by a private memory access.

arm64: entry: avoid kprobe recursion

The cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() function is called when
handling debug exceptions (and synchronous exceptions from BRK
instructions), and so is called when a probed function executes. If the
compiler does not inline cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler(), it
can be probed.

If cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() is probed, any debug
exception or software breakpoint exception will result in recursive
exceptions leading to a stack overflow. This can be triggered with the
ftrace multiple_probes selftest, and as per the example splat below.

This is a regression caused by commit:

  6459b8469753e9fe ("arm64: entry: consolidate Cortex-A76 erratum 1463225 workaround")

... which removed the NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() annotation associated with the
function.

My intent was that cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() would be
inlined into its caller, el1_dbg(), which is marked noinstr and cannot
be probed. Mark cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() as
__always_inline to ensure this.

ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()

On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual
CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with
access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the
ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the
CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.

With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the
file, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the
buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to
wake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

While debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is
OK to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer-&gt;buffers (which is

capabilities: fix potential memleak on error path from vfs_getxattr_alloc()

In cap_inode_getsecurity(), we will use vfs_getxattr_alloc() to
complete the memory allocation of tmpbuf, if we have completed
the memory allocation of tmpbuf, but failed to call handler-&gt;get(...),
there will be a memleak in below logic:

  |-- ret = (int)vfs_getxattr_alloc(mnt_userns, ...)
    |           /* ^^^ alloc for tmpbuf */
    |-- value = krealloc(*xattr_value, error + 1, flags)
    |           /* ^^^ alloc memory */
    |-- error = handler-&gt;get(handler, ...)
    |           /* error! */
    |-- *xattr_value = value
    |           /* xattr_value is &amp;amp;tmpbuf (memory leak!) */

So we will try to free(tmpbuf) after vfs_getxattr_alloc() fails to fix it.

ftrace: Fix use-after-free for dynamic ftrace_ops

KASAN reported a use-after-free with ftrace ops [1]. It was found from
vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content
successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a
use-after-free occurred.

In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the
FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled
ops with the same content.  Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace
callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the
FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value
of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu
synchronization.

However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU
may be accessing the ops.  Add the missing synchronization to fix this
problem.

When an intermediate port's decoders have been exhausted by existing

port decoder (as would be expected), and drops into the failure / cleanup

However, during cleanup of the region reference, a sanity check attempts

causes a NULL pointer dereference BUG.

	switch (tm-&gt;op) {
        case BTRFS_MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
		BUG_ON(tm-&gt;slot &lt; n);

This occurs because we replay the nodes in order that they happened, and
when we do a REPLACE we will log a REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING for every slot,
starting at 0.  'n' here is the number of items in this block, which in
this case was 1, but we had 2 REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING operations.

The actual root cause of this was that we were replaying operations for
a block that shouldn't have been replayed.  Consider the following
sequence of events

1. We have an already modified root, and we do a btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq().
2. We begin removing items from this root, triggering KEY_REPLACE for
   it's child slots.
3. We remove one of the 2 children this root node points to, thus triggering
   the root node promotion of the remaining child, and freeing this node.
4. We modify a new root, and re-allocate the above node to the root node of
   this other root.

The tree mod log looks something like this

	logical 0	op KEY_REPLACE (slot 1)			seq 2
	logical 0	op KEY_REMOVE (slot 1)			seq 3
	logical 0	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)	seq 4
	logical 4096	op LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 0)	seq 5
	logical 8192	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 1)	seq 6
	logical 8192	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)	seq 7
	logical 0	op LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 8192)	seq 8

&gt;From here the bug is triggered by the following steps

1.  Call btrfs_get_old_root() on the new_root.
2.  We call tree_mod_log_oldest_root(btrfs_root_node(new_root)), which is
    currently logical 0.
3.  tree_mod_log_oldest_root() calls tree_mod_log_search_oldest(), which
    gives us the KEY_REPLACE seq 2, and since that's not a
    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE we incorrectly believe that we don't have an old
    root, because we expect that the most recent change should be a
    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE.
4.  Back in tree_mod_log_oldest_root() we don't have a LOG_ROOT_REPLACE,
    so we don't set old_root, we simply use our e

fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for fscrypt_master_key

The approach of fs/crypto/ internally managing the fscrypt_master_key
structs as the payloads of "struct key" objects contained in a
"struct key" keyring has outlived its usefulness.  The original idea was
to simplify the code by reusing code from the keyrings subsystem.
However, several issues have arisen that can't easily be resolved:

- When a master key struct is destroyed, blk_crypto_evict_key() must be
  called on any per-mode keys embedded in it.  (This started being the
  case when inline encryption support was added.)  Yet, the keyrings
  subsystem can arbitrarily delay the destruction of keys, even past the
  time the filesystem was unmounted.  Therefore, currently there is no
  easy way to call blk_crypto_evict_key() when a master key is
  destroyed.  Currently, this is worked around by holding an extra
  reference to the filesystem's request_queue(s).  But it was overlooked
  that the request_queue reference is *not* guaranteed to pin the
  corresponding blk_crypto_profile too; for device-mapper devices that
  support inline crypto, it doesn't.  This can cause a use-after-free.

- When the last inode that was using an incompletely-removed master key
  is evicted, the master key removal is completed by removing the key
  struct from the keyring.  Currently this is done via key_invalidate().
  Yet, key_invalidate() takes the key semaphore.  This can deadlock when
  called from the shrinker, since in fscrypt_ioctl_add_key(), memory is
  allocated with GFP_KERNEL under the same semaphore.

- More generally, the fact that the keyrings subsystem can arbitrarily
  delay the destruction of keys (via garbage collection delay, or via
  random processes getting temporary key references) is undesirable, as
  it means we can't strictly guarantee that all secrets are ever wiped.

- Doing the master key lookups via the keyrings subsystem results in the
  key_permission LSM hook being called.  fscrypt doesn't want this, as
  all access control for encrypted files is designed to happen via the
  files themselves, like any other files.  The workaround which SELinux
  users are using is to change their SELinux policy to grant key search
  access to all domains.  This works, but it is an odd extra step that
  shouldn't really have to be done.

The fix for all these issues is to change the implementation to what I
should have done originally: don't use the keyrings subsystem to keep
track of the filesystem's fscrypt_master_key structs.  Instead, just
store them in a regular kernel data structure, and rework the reference
counting, locking, and lifetime accordingly.  Retain support for
RCU-mode key lookups by using a hash table.  Replace fscrypt_sb_free()
with fscrypt_sb_delete(), which releases the keys synchronously and runs
a bit earlier during unmount, so that block devices are still available.

A side effect of this patch is that neither the master keys themselves
nor the filesystem keyrings will be listed in /proc/keys anymore.
("Master key users" and the master key users keyrings will still be
listed.)  However, this was mostly an implementation detail, and it was
intended just for debugging purposes.  I don't know of anyone using it.

This patch does *not* change how "master key users" (-&gt;mk_users) works;
that still uses the keyrings subsystem.  That is still needed for key
quotas, and changing that isn't necessary to solve the issues listed
above.  If we decide to change that too, it would be a separate patch.

I've marked this as fixing the original commit that added the fscrypt
keyring, but as noted above the most important issue that this patch
fixes wasn't introduced until the addition of inline encryption support.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49900 | i2c: piix4: Fix adapter not be removed in piix4_remove()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49900</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

For the former case, piix4_adapter_count is set as the number of adapters,
while for antoher case it is not set and kept default *zero*.

When piix4 is removed, piix4_remove() removes the adapters added in
piix4_probe(), basing on the piix4_adapter_count value.
Because the count is zero for the single adapter case, the adapter won't
be removed and makes the sources allocated for adapter leaked, such as
the i2c client and device.

These sources can still be accessed by i2c or bus and cause problems.
An easily reproduced case is that if a new adapter is registered, i2c
will get the leaked adapter and try to call smbus_algorithm, which was
already freed:

It is because the memory allocated in wbt_enable_default() is not
released in device_add_disk() error path.
Normally, these memory are freed in:

del_gendisk()
  rq_qos_exit()
    rqos-&gt;ops-&gt;exit(rqos);
      wbt_exit()

So rq_qos_exit() is called to free the rq_wb memory for wbt_init().
However in the error path of device_add_disk(), only
blk_unregister_queue() is called and make rq_wb memory leaked.

Add rq_qos_exit() to the error path to fix it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49903 | ipv6: fix WARNING in ip6_route_net_exit_late()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49903</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

====================================

HCI core will uses hci_rx_work() to process frame, which is queued to
the hdev-&gt;rx_q tail in hci_recv_frame() by HCI driver.

Yet the problem is that, HCI core may not free the skb after handling
ACL data packets. To be more specific, when start fragment does not
contain the L2CAP length, HCI core just copies skb into conn-&gt;rx_skb and
finishes frame process in l2cap_recv_acldata(), without freeing the skb,
which triggers the above memory leak.

This patch solves it by releasing the relative skb, after processing
the above case in l2cap_recv_acldata().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:21:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49909 | Bluetooth: L2CAP: fix use-after-free in l2cap_conn_del()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49909</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: L2CAP: fix use-after-free in l2cap_conn_del()

When l2cap_recv_frame() is invoked to receive data, and the cid is
L2CAP_CID_A2MP, if the channel does not exist, it will create a channel.
However, after a channel is created, the hold operation of the channel
is not performed. In this case, the value of channel reference counting
is 1. As a result, after hci_error_reset() is triggered, l2cap_conn_del()
invokes the close hook function of A2MP to release the channel. Then
 l2cap_chan_unlock(chan) will trigger UAF issue.

The process is as follows:
Receive data:
l2cap_data_channel()
    a2mp_channel_create()  ---&gt;channel ref is 2
    l2cap_chan_put()       ---&gt;channel ref is 1

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free caused by l2cap_reassemble_sdu

Fix the race condition between the following two flows that run in
parallel:

1. l2cap_reassemble_sdu -&gt; chan-&gt;ops-&gt;recv (l2cap_sock_recv_cb) -&gt;
   __sock_queue_rcv_skb.

2. bt_sock_recvmsg -&gt; skb_recv_datagram, skb_free_datagram.

An SKB can be queued by the first flow and immediately dequeued and
freed by the second flow, therefore the callers of l2cap_reassemble_sdu
can't use the SKB after that function returns. However, some places
continue accessing struct l2cap_ctrl that resides in the SKB's CB for a
short time after l2cap_reassemble_sdu returns, leading to a

netfilter: ipset: enforce documented limit to prevent allocating huge memory

Daniel Xu reported that the hash:net,iface type of the ipset subsystem does
not limit adding the same network with different interfaces to a set, which
can lead to huge memory usage or allocation failure.

The quick reproducer is

$ ipset create ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT hash:net,iface hashsize 1048576 timeout 0
$ for i in $(seq 0 100); do /sbin/ipset add ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT 0.0.0.0/0,kaf_$i timeout 0 -exist; done

The backtrace when vmalloc fails:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] ipset: vmalloc error: size 1073741848, exceeds total pages
        &lt;...&gt;

        &lt;...&gt;

The fix is to enforce the limit documented in the ipset(8) manpage:

&gt;  The internal restriction of the hash:net,iface set type is that the same
&gt;  network prefix cannot be stored with more than 64 different interfaces
&gt;  in a single set.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:22:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49912 | btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49912</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests

In the test_no_shared_qgroup() and test_multiple_refs() qgroup self tests,
if we fail to add the tree ref, remove the extent item or remove the
extent ref, we are returning from the test function without freeing the
"old_roots" ulist that was allocated by the previous calls to
btrfs_find_all_roots(). Fix that by calling ulist_free() before returning.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:22:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49913 | btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at find_parent_nodes()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49913</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at find_parent_nodes()

During backref walking, at find_parent_nodes(), if we are dealing with a
data extent and we get an error while resolving the indirect backrefs, at
resolve_indirect_refs(), or in the while loop that iterates over the refs
in the direct refs rbtree, we end up leaking the inode lists attached to
the direct refs we have in the direct refs rbtree that were not yet added
to the refs ulist passed as argument to find_parent_nodes(). Since they
were not yet added to the refs ulist and prelim_release() does not free
the lists, on error the caller can only free the lists attached to the
refs that were added to the refs ulist, all the remaining refs get their
inode lists never freed, therefore leaking their memory.

Fix this by having prelim_release() always free any attached inode list
to each ref found in the rbtree, and have find_parent_nodes() set the
ref's inode list to NULL once it transfers ownership of the inode list
to a ref added to the refs ulist passed to find_parent_nodes().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:22:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49914 | btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49914</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()

During backref walking, at resolve_indirect_refs(), if we get an error
we jump to the 'out' label and call ulist_free() on the 'parents' ulist,
which frees all the elements in the ulist - however that does not free
any inode lists that may be attached to elements, through the 'aux' field
of a ulist node, so we end up leaking lists if we have any attached to
the unodes.

Fix this by calling free_leaf_list() instead of ulist_free() when we exit
from resolve_indirect_refs(). The static function free_leaf_list() is
moved up for this to be possible and it's slightly simplified by removing
unnecessary code.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:22:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49915 | mISDN: fix possible memory leak in mISDN_register_device()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49915</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It triggers NULL pointer dereference when 'neigh-&gt;dev-&gt;dev_addr' is
called in the rose_send_frame(). It's the first occurrence of the
`neigh` is in rose_loopback_timer() as `rose_loopback_neigh', and
the 'dev' in 'rose_loopback_neigh' is initialized sa nullptr.

It had been fixed by commit 3b3fd068c56e3fbea30090859216a368398e39bf
("rose: Fix Null pointer dereference in rose_send_frame()") ever.
But it's introduced by commit 3c53cd65dece47dd1f9d3a809f32e59d1d87b2b8
("rose: check NULL rose_loopback_neigh-&gt;loopback") again.

We fix it by add NULL check in rose_transmit_clear_request(). When
the 'dev' in 'neigh' is NULL, we don't reply the request and just
clear it.

There are two reasons for memleak in dsa_loop_init().

First, fixed_phy_register() create and register phy_device:

fixed_phy_register()
  get_phy_device()
    phy_device_create() # freed by phy_device_free()
  phy_device_register() # freed by phy_device_remove()

But fixed_phy_unregister() only calls phy_device_remove().
So the memory allocated in phy_device_create() is leaked.

Second, when mdio_driver_register() fail in dsa_loop_init(),
it just returns and there is no cleanup for phydevs.

Fix the problems by catching the error of mdio_driver_register()
in dsa_loop_init(), then calling both fixed_phy_unregister() and
phy_device_free() to release phydevs.
Also add a function for phydevs cleanup to avoid duplacate.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:22:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-49927 | nfs4: Fix kmemleak when allocate slot failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-49927</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vma: add give_up_on_oom option on modify/merge, use in uffd release

Currently, if a VMA merge fails due to an OOM condition arising on commit
merge or a failure to duplicate anon_vma's, we report this so the caller
can handle it.

However there are cases where the caller is only ostensibly trying a
merge, and doesn't mind if it fails due to this condition.

Since we do not want to introduce an implicit assumption that we only
actually modify VMAs after OOM conditions might arise, add a 'give up on
oom' option and make an explicit contract that, should this flag be set, we
absolutely will not modify any VMAs should OOM arise and just bail out.

Since it'd be very unusual for a user to try to vma_modify() with this flag
set but be specifying a range within a VMA which ends up being split (which
can fail due to rlimit issues, not only OOM), we add a debug warning for
this condition.

The motivating reason for this is uffd release - syzkaller (and Pedro
Falcato's VERY astute analysis) found a way in which an injected fault on
allocation, triggering an OOM condition on commit merge, would result in
uffd code becoming confused and treating an error value as if it were a VMA
pointer.

To avoid this, we make use of this new VMG flag to ensure that this never
occurs, utilising the fact that, should we be clearing entire VMAs, we do
not wish an OOM event to be reported to us.

Many thanks to Pedro Falcato for his excellent analysis and Jann Horn for
his insightful and intelligent analysis of the situation, both of whom were
instrumental in this fix.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37761 | drm/xe: Fix an out-of-bounds shift when invalidating TLB</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37761</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix an out-of-bounds shift when invalidating TLB

When the size of the range invalidated is larger than
rounddown_pow_of_two(ULONG_MAX),
The function macro roundup_pow_of_two(length) will hit an out-of-bounds
shift [1].

Use a full TLB invalidation for such cases.
v2:
- Use a define for the range size limit over which we use a full
  TLB invalidation. (Lucas)
- Use a better calculation of the limit.

error happens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37763 | drm/imagination: take paired job reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37763</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: take paired job reference

For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until
the fragment job has finished with it.

The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being
prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the
geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.

Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:

The cause of this is:

- drm_prime_gem_destroy calls dma_buf_put(dma_buf) which releases the
  reference to the shared dma_buf. The reference count is 0, so the
  dma_buf is destroyed, which in turn decrements the corresponding
  amdgpu_bo reference count to 0, and the amdgpu_bo is destroyed -
  calling drm_gem_object_release then dma_resv_fini (which destroys the
  reservation object), then finally freeing the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_bo obj-&gt;bo.base.resv is now a dangling pointer to the memory
  formerly allocated to the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_gem_object_del calls ttm_bo_put(&amp;amp;nvbo-&gt;bo) which calls
  ttm_bo_release, which schedules ttm_bo_delayed_delete.

- ttm_bo_delayed_delete runs and dereferences the dangling resv pointer,
  resulting in a general protection fault.

Fix this by moving the drm_prime_gem_destroy call from
nouveau_gem_object_del to nouveau_bo_del_ttm. This ensures that it will
be run after ttm_bo_delayed_delete.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37766 | drm/amd/pm: Prevent division by zero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37766</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler

struct rdma_cm_id has member "struct work_struct net_work"
that is reused for enqueuing cma_netevent_work_handler()s
onto cma_wq.

Below crash[1] can occur if more than one call to
cma_netevent_callback() occurs in quick succession,
which further enqueues cma_netevent_work_handler()s for the
same rdma_cm_id, overwriting any previously queued work-item(s)
that was just scheduled to run i.e. there is no guarantee
the queued work item may run between two successive calls
to cma_netevent_callback() and the 2nd INIT_WORK would overwrite
the 1st work item (for the same rdma_cm_id), despite grabbing
id_table_lock during enqueue.

Also drgn analysis [2] indicates the work item was likely overwritten.

Fix this by moving the INIT_WORK() to __rdma_create_id(),
so that it doesn't race with any existing queue_work() or
its worker thread.

	},
	.func = (work_func_t)cma_netevent_work_handler+0x0 = 0xffffffffc2cec280,
}

Suspicion is that pwq is NULL:
&gt;&gt;&gt; trace[8]["pwq"]
(struct pool_workqueue *)

In process_one_work(), pwq is assigned from:
struct pool_workqueue *pwq = get_work_pwq(work);

and get_work_pwq() is:
static struct pool_workqueue *get_work_pwq(struct work_struct *work)
{
 	unsigned long data = atomic_long_read(&amp;amp;work-&gt;data);

 	if (data &amp; WORK_STRUCT_PWQ)
 		return work_struct_pwq(data);
 	else
 		return NULL;
}

WORK_STRUCT_PWQ is 0x4:
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(prog['WORK_STRUCT_PWQ']))
Object(prog, 'enum work_flags', value=4)

But work-&gt;data is 536870912 which is 0x20000000.
So, get_work_pwq() returns NULL and we crash in process_one_work():
3168	strscpy(worker-&gt;desc, pwq-&gt;wq-&gt;name, WORKER_DESC_LEN);

ktest recently reported crashes while running several buffered io tests

The signature indicates an invalid address dereference with low bits of
slab-&gt;obj_exts being set. The bits were outside of the range used by

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in __smb2_lease_break_noti()

Move tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is
referenced when ksmbd server thread terminates, It will not be freed,
but conn-&gt;tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed
asynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti
calls ksmbd_conn_write, which can cause use-after-free
when conn-&gt;ksmbd_transport is already freed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37778 | ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37778</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

to NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise
sess-&gt;user but that function may return without doing so. If
that happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate,
will be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess-&gt;user.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37779 | lib/iov_iter: fix to increase non slab folio refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37779</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/iov_iter: fix to increase non slab folio refcount

When testing EROFS file-backed mount over v9fs on qemu, I encountered a
folio UAF issue.  The page sanity check reports the following call trace. 
The root cause is that pages in bvec are coalesced across a folio bounary.
The refcount of all non-slab folios should be increased to ensure
p9_releas_pages can put them correctly.

isofs: Prevent the use of too small fid

syzbot reported a slab-out-of-bounds Read in isofs_fh_to_parent. [1]

The handle_bytes value passed in by the reproducing program is equal to 12.
In handle_to_path(), only 12 bytes of memory are allocated for the structure
file_handle-&gt;f_handle member, which causes an out-of-bounds access when
accessing the member parent_block of the structure isofs_fid in isofs,
because accessing parent_block requires at least 16 bytes of f_handle.
Here, fh_len is used to indirectly confirm that the value of handle_bytes
is greater than 3 before accessing parent_block.

i2c: cros-ec-tunnel: defer probe if parent EC is not present

When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent
device will not be found, leading to NULL pointer dereference.

That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then
loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device).

drm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check

The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers
returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This
could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.

This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is
valid before dereferencing them.

net: ti: icss-iep: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request

The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.
Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),
results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.

To fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw
function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when
disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request
structure, as its contents are irrelevant in this case.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37786 | net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37786</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure

If complete = true in dsa_tree_setup(), it means that we are the last
switch of the tree which is successfully probing, and we should be
setting up all switches from our probe path.

After "complete" becomes true, dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any
subsequent function may fail. If that happens, the entire tree setup is
in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing
(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's
dst-&gt;ports, and maybe dst-&gt;rtable), and switch N failed to probe, ending
the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.

If switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed
from dst-&gt;ports. However, the dst-&gt;rtable elements pointing to its ports,
as created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to
use-after-free if dereferenced.

If dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely
possible because that is where ds-&gt;ops-&gt;setup() is, we get a kasan
report like this:

The simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its
entirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating
it even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,
because dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already
exists in dst-&gt;rtable, allocating if not.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in
dsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be
called from the tree setup error path.

In my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added
dsa_link elements to dst-&gt;rtable. Prior to that, each switch had its own
ds-&gt;rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree
is potentially persistent memory.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37787 | net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37787</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond &amp;&amp; !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.

To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37788 | cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37788</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path

In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a
memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,
but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow
goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from
(i-1)th iteration are freed.

Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37789 | net: openvswitch: fix nested key length validation in the set() action</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37789</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Purge vif txq in ieee80211_do_stop()

After ieee80211_do_stop() SKB from vif's txq could still be processed.
Indeed another concurrent vif schedule_and_wake_txq call could cause
those packets to be dequeued (see ieee80211_handle_wake_tx_queue())
without checking the sdata current state.

Because vif.drv_priv is now cleared in this function, this could lead to
driver crash.

For example in ath12k, ahvif is store in vif.drv_priv. Thus if
ath12k_mac_op_tx() is called after ieee80211_do_stop(), ahvif-&gt;ah can be
NULL, leading the ath12k_warn(ahvif-&gt;ah,...) call in this function to
trigger the NULL deref below.

to uninitialized fields. To fix it let's set this bit after device was
registered (as before patch c411c62cc133) and to fix previous problem let's
add one more bit in addition to 'HCI_UART_PROTO_READY' which allows to
perform power up without original bit set (pls see commit c411c62cc133).

misc: pci_endpoint_test: Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error

After devm_request_irq() fails with error in pci_endpoint_test_request_irq(),
the pci_endpoint_test_free_irq_vectors() is called assuming that all IRQs
have been released.

However, some requested IRQs remain unreleased, so there are still
/proc/irq/* entries remaining, and this results in WARN() with the
following message:

  remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/30', leaking at least 'pci-endpoint-test.0'
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 202 at fs/proc/generic.c:719 remove_proc_entry +0x190/0x19c

To solve this issue, set the number of remaining IRQs to test-&gt;num_irqs,
and release IRQs in advance by calling pci_endpoint_test_release_irq().

KVM: x86: Acquire SRCU in KVM_GET_MP_STATE to protect guest memory accesses

Acquire a lock on kvm-&gt;srcu when userspace is getting MP state to handle a
rather extreme edge case where "accepting" APIC events, i.e. processing
pending INIT or SIPI, can trigger accesses to guest memory.  If the vCPU
is in L2 with INIT *and* a TRIPLE_FAULT request pending, then getting MP
state will trigger a nested VM-Exit by way of -&gt;check_nested_events(), and
emuating the nested VM-Exit can access guest memory.

The splat was originally hit by syzkaller on a Google-internal kernel, and
reproduced on an upstream kernel by hacking the triple_fault_event_test
selftest to stuff a pending INIT, store an MSR on VM-Exit (to generate a
memory access on VMX), and do vcpu_mp_state_get() to trigger the scenario.

sctp: detect and prevent references to a freed transport in sendmsg

sctp_sendmsg() re-uses associations and transports when possible by
doing a lookup based on the socket endpoint and the message destination
address, and then sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() sets the selected transport in
all the message chunks to be sent.

There's a possible race condition if another thread triggers the removal
of that selected transport, for instance, by explicitly unbinding an
address with setsockopt(SCTP_SOCKOPT_BINDX_REM), after the chunks have
been set up and before the message is sent. This can happen if the send
buffer is full, during the period when the sender thread temporarily
releases the socket lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf().

This causes the access to the transport data in
sctp_outq_select_transport(), when the association outqueue is flushed,
to result in a use-after-free read.

This change avoids this scenario by having sctp_transport_free() signal
the freeing of the transport, tagging it as "dead". In order to do this,
the patch restores the "dead" bit in struct sctp_transport, which was
removed in
commit 47faa1e4c50e ("sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport").

Then, in the scenario where the sender thread has released the socket
lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf(), the bit is checked again after
re-acquiring the socket lock to detect the deletion. This is done while
holding a reference to the transport to prevent it from being freed in
the process.

If the transport was deleted while the socket lock was relinquished,
sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() will return -EAGAIN to let userspace retry the
send.

The bug was found by a private syzbot instance (see the error report [1]
and the C reproducer that triggers it [2]).</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23143 | net: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.

When I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two
LOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]

Reproduction Steps:

  1) Mount CIFS
  2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS
  3) Unmount CIFS
  4) Unload the CIFS module
  5) Remove the iptables rule

At step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying
TCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in
FIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.

At this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still
alive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.

  # ss -tan
  State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port
  FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445

  # lsmod | grep cifs
  cifs                 1159168  0

This highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module
and the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release()
and it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to
close the connection gracefully.

While this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because
CIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk-&gt;sk_lock
using sock_lock_init_class_and_name().

Once an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires,
sk-&gt;sk_lock is acquired.

Then, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where
hlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since
the module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning
and returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.

If LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling
sock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded
while such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.

Let's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name()
and release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().

Note that sock_lock_init() clears sk-&gt;sk_owner for svc_create_socket()
that calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket,
which clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.

mptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow

When testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in
'mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow' because subflow_req-&gt;msk is NULL.

Call trace:

  mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:63 (discriminator 4)) (P)

According to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very
short time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due
to multiple reasons.

Even if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they
can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The
'subflow_req-&gt;msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,
and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req-&gt;msk' under the
`own_req == true` conditional.

Note that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because
the same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the
code has been moved to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23146 | mfd: ene-kb3930: Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()

The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not
been probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`
to queue an IBI work task, leading to "Unable to handle kernel read from
unreadable memory" and resulting in a kernel panic.

Typical IBI handling flow:
1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.
2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI
   and assigns `dev-&gt;ibi = ibi`.
3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls
   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driver’s IBI
   handler task.

However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe
sequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev-&gt;ibi` to be `NULL`,
leading to a kernel panic.

Add a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing
an uninitialized `dev-&gt;ibi`, ensuring stability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23148 | soc: samsung: exynos-chipid: Add NULL pointer check in exynos_chipid_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The following loop is located right above 'if' statement.

for (i = count-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
	/* is more than half of this entry in 2nd half of the block? */
	if (size + map[i].size/2 &gt; blocksize/2)
		break;
	size += map[i].size;
	move++;
}

'i' in this case could go down to -1, in which case sum of active entries
wouldn't exceed half the block size, but previous behaviour would also do
split in half if sum would exceed at the very last block, which in case of
having too many long name files in a single block could lead to
out-of-bounds access and following use-after-free.

bus: mhi: host: Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf

A client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce
incoming data during the client driver's tear down. The client driver
might also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to
mhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs
after mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic
will occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault.

This occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state
after locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel
state is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data.

PCI: vmd: Make vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type

The access to the PCI config space via pci_ops::read and pci_ops::write is
a low-level hardware access. The functions can be accessed with disabled
interrupts even on PREEMPT_RT. The pci_lock is a raw_spinlock_t for this
purpose.

A spinlock_t becomes a sleeping lock on PREEMPT_RT, so it cannot be
acquired with disabled interrupts. The vmd_dev::cfg_lock is accessed in
the same context as the pci_lock.

Make vmd_dev::cfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type so it can be used with
interrupts disabled.

Device setup:

     netdevsim0 (down)
     ^        ^
  bond        netdevsim1.100@netdevsim1 allmulticast=on (down)

When we enslave the lower device (netdevsim0) which has a vlan, we
propagate vlan's allmuti/promisc flags during ndo_open. This causes
(re)locking on of the real_dev.

Propagate allmulti/promisc on flags change, not on the open. There
is a slight semantics change that vlans that are down now propagate
the flags, but this seems unlikely to result in the real issues.

Reproducer:

  echo 0 1 &gt; /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device

  dev_path=$(ls -d /sys/bus/netdevsim/devices/netdevsim0/net/*)
  dev=$(echo $dev_path | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)

index 18446744073709550692 (decimal, unsigned long long)
= 0xfffffffffffffc64 (hexadecimal, unsigned long long)
= -924 (decimal, long long)

In f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), UBSAN detects that get_nid() tries to
access .i_nid[-924], it means both offset[0] and level should zero.

The possible case should be in f2fs_do_truncate_blocks(), we try to
truncate inode size to zero, however, dn.ofs_in_node is zero and
dn.node_page is not an inode page, so it fails to truncate inode page,
and then pass zeroed free_from to f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), result
in this issue.

	if (dn.ofs_in_node || IS_INODE(dn.node_page)) {
		f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range(&amp;amp;dn, count);
		free_from += count;
	}

I guess the reason why dn.node_page is not an inode page could be: there
are multiple nat entries share the same node block address, once the node
block address was reused, f2fs_get_node_page() may load a non-inode block.

Let's add a sanity check for such condition to avoid out-of-bounds access
issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37740 | jfs: add sanity check for agwidth in dbMount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37740</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: Prevent copying of nlink with value 0 from disk inode

syzbot report a deadlock in diFree. [1]

When calling "ioctl$LOOP_SET_STATUS64", the offset value passed in is 4,
which does not match the mounted loop device, causing the mapping of the
mounted loop device to be invalidated.

When creating the directory and creating the inode of iag in diReadSpecial(),
read the page of fixed disk inode (AIT) in raw mode in read_metapage(), the
metapage data it returns is corrupted, which causes the nlink value of 0 to be
assigned to the iag inode when executing copy_from_dinode(), which ultimately
causes a deadlock when entering diFree().

To avoid this, first check the nlink value of dinode before setting iag inode.

=====================================================

The reason is that imap is not properly initialized after memory
allocation. It will cause the snprintf() function to write uninitialized
data into linebuf within hex_dump_to_buffer().

Fix this by using kzalloc instead of kmalloc to clear its content at the
beginning in diMount().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37743 | wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics

Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and
standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from
the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the
ppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor
mode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is
captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.

When the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is
activated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,
the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter
configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and
kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a
memory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while
enabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while
enabling extended statistics mode in the driver.

Fix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in
the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone
monitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.
These TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor
mode in the future.

PM: hibernate: Avoid deadlock in hibernate_compressor_param_set()

syzbot reported a deadlock in lock_system_sleep() (see below).

The write operation to "/sys/module/hibernate/parameters/compressor"
conflicts with the registration of ieee80211 device, resulting in a deadlock
when attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex under param_lock.

To avoid this deadlock, change hibernate_compressor_param_set() to use
mutex_trylock() for attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex and
return -EBUSY when it fails.

Task flags need not be saved or adjusted before calling
mutex_trylock(&amp;amp;system_transition_mutex) because the caller is not going
to end up waiting for this mutex and if it runs concurrently with system
suspend in progress, it will be frozen properly when it returns to user
space.

syzbot report:

perf/dwc_pcie: fix duplicate pci_dev devices

During platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device
pci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse
still, accessing the duplicated device leads to list corruption as its
mutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same as the original.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37747 | perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event

Perf can hang while freeing a sigtrap event if a related deferred
signal hadn't managed to be sent before the file got closed:

perf_event_overflow()
   task_work_add(perf_pending_task)

fput()
   task_work_add(____fput())

task_work_run()
    ____fput()
        perf_release()
            perf_event_release_kernel()
                _free_event()
                    perf_pending_task_sync()
                        task_work_cancel() -&gt; FAILED
                        rcuwait_wait_event()

Once task_work_run() is running, the list of pending callbacks is
removed from the task_struct and from this point on task_work_cancel()
can't remove any pending and not yet started work items, hence the
task_work_cancel() failure and the hang on rcuwait_wait_event().

Task work could be changed to remove one work at a time, so a work
running on the current task can always cancel a pending one, however
the wait / wake design is still subject to inverted dependencies when
remote targets are involved, as pictured by Oleg:

T1                                                      T2

fd = perf_event_open(pid =&gt; T2-&gt;pid);                  fd = perf_event_open(pid =&gt; T1-&gt;pid);
close(fd)                                              close(fd)
                                                      
    perf_event_overflow()                                  perf_event_overflow()
       task_work_add(perf_pending_task)                        task_work_add(perf_pending_task)
                                                     
    fput()                                                 fput()
        task_work_add(____fput())                              task_work_add(____fput())

    task_work_run()                                        task_work_run()
        ____fput()                                             ____fput()
            perf_release()                                         perf_release()
                perf_event_release_kernel()                            perf_event_release_kernel()
                    _free_event()                                          _free_event()
                        perf_pending_task_sync()                               perf_pending_task_sync()
                            rcuwait_wait_event()                                   rcuwait_wait_event()

Therefore the only option left is to acquire the event reference count
upon queueing the perf task work and release it from the task work, just
like it was done before 3a5465418f5f ("perf: Fix event leak upon exec and file release")
but without the leaks it fixed.

Some adjustments are necessary to make it work:

* A child event might dereference its parent upon freeing. Care must be
  taken to release the parent last.

* Some places assuming the event doesn't have any reference held and
  therefore can be freed right away must instead put the reference and
  let the reference counting to its job.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37748 | iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37748</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group

Currently, mtk_iommu calls during probe iommu_device_register before
the hw_list from driver data is initialized. Since iommu probing issue
fix, it leads to NULL pointer dereference in mtk_iommu_device_group when
hw_list is accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe).

So, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register is called
after the driver data are initialized.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37749 | net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data on ppp_sync_txmung</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37749</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is not sufficient to directly validate the limit on the data that

Move the check at the end of the configuration update process to also
catch scenarios where the limit is indirectly updated, for example
with the following configurations:

tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1: root sfq limit 2 flows 1 divisor 1

s390/cpumf: Fix double free on error in cpumf_pmu_event_init()

In PMU event initialization functions
 - cpumsf_pmu_event_init()
 - cpumf_pmu_event_init()
 - cfdiag_event_init()
the partially created event had to be removed when an error was detected.
The event::event_init() member function had to release all resources
it allocated in case of error. event::destroy() had to be called
on freeing an event after it was successfully created and
event::event_init() returned success.

With

commit c70ca298036c ("perf/core: Simplify the perf_event_alloc() error path")

this is not necessary anymore. The performance subsystem common
code now always calls event::destroy() to clean up the allocated
resources created during event initialization.

Remove the event::destroy() invocation in PMU event initialization
or that function is called twice for each event that runs into an
error condition in event creation.

This is the kernel log entry which shows up without the fix:

drm/i915/huc: Fix fence not released on early probe errors

HuC delayed loading fence, introduced with commit 27536e03271da
("drm/i915/huc: track delayed HuC load with a fence"), is registered with
object tracker early on driver probe but unregistered only from driver
remove, which is not called on early probe errors.  Since its memory is
allocated under devres, then released anyway, it may happen to be
allocated again to the fence and reused on future driver probes, resulting
in kernel warnings that taint the kernel:

That scenario is most easily reproducible with
igt@i915_module_load@reload-with-fault-injection.

Fix the issue by moving the cleanup step to driver release path.

net: libwx: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

page_pool_dev_alloc_pages could return NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This is similar to commit 001ba0902046
("net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error").

This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37756 | net: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37756</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect

syzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and then
run into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vague
recollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.
Supporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offload
is enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.
Disconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.

The immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,
but that's just the easiest bug to trigger:

tipc: fix memory leak in tipc_link_xmit

In case the backlog transmit queue for system-importance messages is overloaded,
tipc_link_xmit() returns -ENOBUFS but the skb list is not purged. This leads to
memory leak and failure when a skb is allocated.

This commit fixes this issue by purging the skb list before tipc_link_xmit()
returns.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37758 | ata: pata_pxa: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in pxa_ata_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37758</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fixed in:

 

 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 


Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 01:02:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4143 | Missing validation of redirect_uri on authorize endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4143</link><description>The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 01:02:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4145 | Netgear EX6200 sub_3D0BC buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4145</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Netgear EX6200 1.0.3.94.

Prior to versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2, attacker compromise of either the Elastic service or the extender plugin can cause denial of service of the scheduler. This is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed. The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive amounts of memory.

Note that, by default, there is only one authenticator available (Standard XWiki Authenticator). So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).

In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46342 | Kyverno vulnerable to bypass of policy rules that use namespace selectors in match statements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46342</link><description>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4122 | Netgear JWNR2000v2 sub_435E04 command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4122</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Netgear JWNR2000v2 1.0.0.11.

In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 01:47:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32444 | vLLM Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Mooncake Integration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32444</link><description>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 01:47:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46560 | vLLM phi4mm: Quadratic Time Complexity in Input Token Processing​ leads to denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46560</link><description>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., &lt;|audio_|&gt;, &lt;|image_|&gt;) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 01:47:52 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
