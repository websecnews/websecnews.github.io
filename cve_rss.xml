Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers &amp; strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30353 | Directus&amp;#x27;s webhook trigger flows can leak sensitive data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30353</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.5.0, when a Flow with the "Webhook" trigger and the "Data of Last Operation" response body encounters a ValidationError thrown by a failed condition operation, the API response includes sensitive data. This includes environmental variables, sensitive API keys, user accountability information, and operational data. This issue poses a significant security risk, as any unintended exposure of this data could lead to potential misuse. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2499 | Client side access control bypass in the permission component in

Starting in version 10.10.0 and prior to version 11.5.0, a suspended user can use the token generated in session auth mode to access the API despite their status. This happens because there is a check missing in `verifySessionJWT` to verify that a user is actually still active and allowed to access the API. One can extract the session token obtained by, e.g. login in to the app while still active and then, after the user has been suspended continue to use that token until it expires. Version 11.5.0 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 17:29:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30350 | Directus&amp;#x27;s S3 assets become unavailable after a burst of HEAD requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30350</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content.

Some tools use Directus to sync content and assets, and some of those tools use the HEAD method to check the existence of files. When making many HEAD requests at once, at some point, all assets are eventually served as 403. This causes denial of assets for all policies of Directus, including Admin and Public. Version 12.0.1 of the `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package, corresponding to version 11.5.0 of Directus, fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:55:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30225 | Directus&amp;#x27;s S3 assets become unavailable after a burst of malformed transformations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30225</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content.

A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query; icingaweb2/directore/notification; icingaweb2/director/serviceset; and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it.  This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1. If upgrading is not feasible, disable the director module for the users other than admin role for the time being.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:53:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45351 | Game center application has code execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45351</link><description>A code execution vulnerability exists in the Xiaomi Game center application product.

Versions prior to 4.0.3 are vulnerable to a sophisticated attack that could modify virtual host name on disk and then make it unrecoverable (with other on disk file modifications) can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the browsers of management UI users. When a virtual host on a RabbitMQ node fails to start, recent versions
will display an error message (a notification) in the management UI. The error message includes virtual host name, which was not escaped prior to open source RabbitMQ 4.0.3 and Tanzu RabbitMQ 4.0.3, 3.13.8. An attack that both makes a virtual host fail to start and creates a new virtual host name with an XSS code snippet or changes the name of an existing virtual host on disk could trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the management UI (the user's browser). Open source RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and Tanzu RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and `3.13.8` patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 23:13:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27837 | An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 10.05.0.

In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:25:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31896 | IBM SPSS Statistics information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31896</link><description>IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0, 27.0.1, 28.0.1, and 29.0.2 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:15:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28904 | WordPress Web Directory Free plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.6 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28904</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Shamalli Web Directory Free allows Blind SQL Injection.

Adding `?raw??` or `?import&amp;amp;raw??` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This bypass exists because trailing separators such as `?` are removed in several places, but are not accounted for in query string regexes. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option) are affected.
