The attacker must have permissions to access the jobs but then they were saved into the catalog service using the wrong owner permissions. Therefore it may have been possible to save into spaces where the attacker does not have write permissions.

There is no workaround.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:45:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66461 | FULLBACK Manager Pro provided by GS Yuasa International Ltd. registers  two Windows services with unquoted file paths.

md/raid0, raid10: Don't set discard sectors for request queue

It should use disk_stack_limits to get a proper max_discard_sectors
rather than setting a value by stack drivers.

And there is a bug. If all member disks are rotational devices,
raid0/raid10 set max_discard_sectors. So the member devices are
not ssd/nvme, but raid0/raid10 export the wrong value. It reports
warning messages in function __blkdev_issue_discard when mkfs.xfs
like this:

regulator: core: Use different devices for resource allocation and DT lookup

Following by the below discussion, there's the potential UAF issue
between regulator and mfd.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221128143601.1698148-1-yangyingliang@huawei.com/

From the analysis of Yingliang

CPU A				|CPU B
mt6370_probe()			|
  devm_mfd_add_devices()	|
				|mt6370_regulator_probe()
				|  regulator_register()
				|    //allocate init_data and add it to devres
				|    regulator_of_get_init_data()
i2c_unregister_device()		|
  device_del()			|
    devres_release_all()	|
      // init_data is freed	|
      release_nodes()		|
				|  // using init_data causes UAF
				|  regulator_register()

It's common to use mfd core to create child device for the regulator.
In order to do the DT lookup for init data, the child that registered
the regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes
init data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen
when parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing
some operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.

To fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the
different devices for init data allocation and DT lookup.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50617 | drm/amdgpu/powerplay/psm: Fix memory leak in power state init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register

Chapter "B Generic UART" in "ARM Server Base System Architecture" [1]
documentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART
does not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and
amba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke
pl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This
commit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the
access to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.

When the kernel enables DMA engine with "CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y", Linux
SBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.
For most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write
behaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause
obvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen
virtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.
Xen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is
accessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA
compatible, it will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA
PL011 driver access DMACR register, it will get an unhandled data abort
fault and the application will get a segmentation fault:

media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()

Syzbot reports a memory leak in "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".
The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's
adapter-&gt;priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,
it will exit before incrementing "num_adapters_initalized",
which is used as a reference counter to free all adap-&gt;priv
in "dvb_usb_adapter_exit()". There are multiple error paths that
can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the
error handling paths for "dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()",
"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()" and "dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()"
within "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".

This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the
current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's
adap-&gt;priv is not freed.

Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap-&gt;priv in the
"stream_init_err:" label in the error path. The rest of the
(accounted for) adap-&gt;priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()
as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.

wifi: ath11k: fix monitor mode bringup crash

When the interface is brought up in monitor mode, it leads
to NULL pointer dereference crash. This crash happens when
the packet type is extracted for a SKB. This extraction
which is present in the received msdu delivery path,is
not needed for the monitor ring packets since they are
all RAW packets. Hence appending the flags with
"RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR" to skip that extraction.

Observed calltrace:

The source of this warning is in iosys_map_clear() called from
dma_buf_vmap(). It conditionally sets values based on map-&gt;is_iomem. The
iosys_map variables are allocated uninitialized on the stack leading to
-&gt;is_iomem having all kinds of values and not only 0/1.

Fix this by zeroing the iosys_map variables.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50629 | wifi: rsi: Fix memory leak in rsi_coex_attach()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50629</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault

The vma_lock and hugetlb_fault_mutex are dropped before handling userfault
and reacquire them again after handle_userfault(), but reacquire the
vma_lock could lead to UAF[1,2] due to the following race,

hugetlb_fault
  hugetlb_no_page
    /*unlock vma_lock */
    hugetlb_handle_userfault
      handle_userfault
        /* unlock mm-&gt;mmap_lock*/
                                           vm_mmap_pgoff

        /* lock vma_lock again  &lt;--- UAF */
    /* unlock vma_lock */

Since the vma_lock will unlock immediately after
hugetlb_handle_userfault(), let's drop the unneeded lock and unlock in
hugetlb_handle_userfault() to fix the issue.

The reason for this is that on certain arm64 configuration since
e35123d83ee3 ("arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when
CONFIG_LTO=y"), READ_ONCE() may be promoted to a full atomic acquire
instruction which cannot be used on unaligned addresses.

Fix it by avoiding READ_ONCE() in read_instrumented_memory(), and simply
forcing the compiler to do the required access by casting to the
appropriate volatile type. In terms of generated code this currently
only affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()
implementation.

The only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the access
itself, although on most architectures a plain load up to machine word
size should still be atomic (a fact the default READ_ONCE() still relies
on itself).</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53743 | PCI: Free released resource after coalescing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver

The device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device
uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the
pointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The
problem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the
kfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the
vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.

Since the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev
object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53747 | vc_screen: reload load of struct vc_data pointer in vcs_write() to avoid UAF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup

variable *nplanes is provided by user via system call argument. The
possible value of q_data-&gt;fmt-&gt;num_planes is 1-3, while the value
of *nplanes can be 1-8. The array access by index i can cause array
out-of-bounds.

Fix this bug by checking *nplanes against the array size.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53749 | x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53749</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 ("x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000020081000

which then looks like a filesystem bug rather than the incorrect
exception annotation that it is.

net: deal with integer overflows in kmalloc_reserve()

Blamed commit changed:
    ptr = kmalloc(size);
    if (ptr)
      size = ksize(ptr);

    size = kmalloc_size_roundup(size);
    ptr = kmalloc(size);

This allowed various crash as reported by syzbot [1]
and Kyle Zeng.

Problem is that if @size is bigger than 0x80000001,
kmalloc_size_roundup(size) returns 2^32.

kmalloc_reserve() uses a 32bit variable (obj_size),
so 2^32 is truncated to 0.

kmalloc(0) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is not handled by
skb allocations.

Following trace can be triggered if a netdev-&gt;mtu is set
close to 0x7fffffff

We might in the future limit netdev-&gt;mtu to more sensible
limit (like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE).

This patch is based on a syzbot report, and also a report
and tentative fix from Kyle Zeng.

scsi: lpfc: Fix ioremap issues in lpfc_sli4_pci_mem_setup()

When if_type equals zero and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)
returns false, drbl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This passes a NULL
pointer to iounmap(), which can trigger a WARN() on certain arches.

When if_type equals six and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)
returns true, drbl_regs_memmap_p may has been remapped and
ctrl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This is a resource leak and passes a
NULL pointer to iounmap().

To fix these issues, we need to add null checks before iounmap(), and
change some goto labels.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53755 | dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53755</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback

Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host

the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function
is called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued
queues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being
mistakenly called with a NULL pointer.

KVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs

KVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as
a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,
evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark
that the msr bitmap was changed.

vmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr
-&gt; vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The
function checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is
insufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the
code might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value
left by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be
preempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple
times from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.

The manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the
solution is to use vmx-&gt;vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.

spi: atmel-quadspi: Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()

An early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove() doesn't prevent the device
unbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent
and unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).
So using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.

Instead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware
access and clk disable.

Also add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.
The latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by
the spi core.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53759 | HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 ("HID:

minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead
acquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF in hci_disconnect_all_sync

Use-after-free can occur in hci_disconnect_all_sync if a connection is
deleted by concurrent processing of a controller event.

To prevent this the code now tries to iterate over the list backwards
to ensure the links are cleanup before its parents, also it no longer
relies on a cursor, instead it always uses the last element since
hci_abort_conn_sync is guaranteed to call hci_conn_del.

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly

The root cause is we applied both v1 and v2 of the patch, v2 is the right
fix, so it needs to revert v1 in order to fix reported issue.

v1:
commit d48a7b3a72f1 ("f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly")
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230109034920.492914-1-chao@kernel.org/

regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers

When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.

This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
allocation num_config_regs number of times.

This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.

Amit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device
due to memory corruption (see "Closes" tag for Amit's report). The KASAN

virtio-net: fix received length check in big packets

Since commit 4959aebba8c0 ("virtio-net: use mtu size as buffer length
for big packets"), when guest gso is off, the allocated size for big
packets is not MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE anymore but depends on
negotiated MTU. The number of allocated frags for big packets is stored
in vi-&gt;big_packets_num_skbfrags.

Because the host announced buffer length can be malicious (e.g. the host
vhost_net driver's get_rx_bufs is modified to announce incorrect
length), we need a check in virtio_net receive path. Currently, the
check is not adapted to the new change which can lead to NULL page
pointer dereference in the below while loop when receiving length that
is larger than the allocated one.

This commit fixes the received length check corresponding to the new
change.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40293 | iommufd: Don&amp;#x27;t overflow during division for dirty tracking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40293</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The size of the 'value' array in the mgmt_adv_pattern structure is 31.

This situation can happen for block devices because when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, the maximum logical_block_size
is 64 KiB. set_init_blocksize() then sets the block device
inode-&gt;i_blkbits to 13, which is within this limit.

File I/O does not trigger this problem because for filesystems that do
not support the FS_LBS feature, sb_set_blocksize() prevents
sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits from being larger than PAGE_SHIFT. During inode
allocation, alloc_inode()-&gt;inode_init_always() assigns inode-&gt;i_blkbits
from sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits. Currently, only xfs_fs_type has the FS_LBS
flag, and since xfs I/O paths do not reach submit_bh_wbc(), it does not
hit the left-shift underflow issue.

platform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister

regulator_unregister() already frees the associated GPIO device. On
ThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue that leads to
random failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to
allocate interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the
pinctrl_intel_platform module unexpectedly drops to zero when this
driver defers its probe.

This behavior can also be reproduced by unloading the module directly.

Fix the issue by removing the redundant release of the GPIO device

net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass

syzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is
due to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being
deleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been
toggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we
have MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN
filtering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't
happen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled
because we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop
learning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is
initialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port
state bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead
in the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.

btrfs: ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors

[BUG]
During development of a minor feature (make sure all btrfs_bio::end_io()
is called in task context), I noticed a crash in generic/388, where
metadata writes triggered new works after btrfs_stop_all_workers().

It turns out that it can even happen without any code modification, just
using RAID5 for metadata and the same workload from generic/388 is going
to trigger the use-after-free.

[CAUSE]
If btrfs hits an error, the fs is marked as error, no new
transaction is allowed thus metadata is in a frozen state.

But there are some metadata modifications before that error, and they are
still in the btree inode page cache.

Since there will be no real transaction commit, all those dirty folios
are just kept as is in the page cache, and they can not be invalidated
by invalidate_inode_pages2() call inside close_ctree(), because they are
dirty.

And finally after btrfs_stop_all_workers(), we call iput() on btree
inode, which triggers writeback of those dirty metadata.

And if the fs is using RAID56 metadata, this will trigger RMW and queue
new works into rmw_workers, which is already stopped, causing warning
from queue_work() and use-after-free.

[FIX]
Add a special handling for write_one_eb(), that if the fs is already in
an error state, immediately mark the bbio as failure, instead of really
submitting them.

Then during close_ctree(), iput() will just discard all those dirty
tree blocks without really writing them back, thus no more new jobs for
already stopped-and-freed workqueues.

The extra discard in write_one_eb() also acts as an extra safenet.
E.g. the transaction abort is triggered by some extent/free space
tree corruptions, and since extent/free space tree is already corrupted
some tree blocks may be allocated where they shouldn't be (overwriting
existing tree blocks). In that case writing them back will further
corrupting the fs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40304 | fbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40304</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

However, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to

p9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -&gt; ... -&gt; anon_pipe_read() which (before

orangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...

Willy Tarreau  forwarded me a message from
Disclosure  with the following
warning:

&gt; The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition
&gt; rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL
&gt; (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on
&gt; valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging
&gt; the thread.

I easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel
oops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure
sent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based
this patch on.

After xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an
xattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns
a hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs
used hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using
hash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong
hash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a
getattr for the xattr "security.capability" every time. Orangefs
negative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the
xattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for
"security.capability" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were
ever freed.

I changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead
and the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40307 | exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40307</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing

accel/habanalabs: support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory

When IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return
addresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without
VM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the
VM_PFNMAP restriction.

Fix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP
in the VMA before mapping. This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel
crashes. The memory is still driver-allocated and cannot be accessed
directly by userspace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40312 | jfs: Verify inode mode when loading from disk</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40312</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget

In the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget
structure (pdev-&gt;gadget) was freed before its endpoints.
The endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.
Freeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.
When the endpoints are subsequently freed, this results in a use-after-free.

Fix:
By separating the usb_del_gadget_udc() operation into distinct "del" and
"put" steps, cdnsp_gadget_free_endpoints() can be executed prior to the
final release of the gadget structure with usb_put_gadget().

A patch similar to bb9c74a5bd14("usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure
 only after freeing endpoints").</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40315 | usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40315</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.

A race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently
with ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()
sets ffs-&gt;epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs-&gt;eps_count to 0, leading
to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile-&gt;ep in
ffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().

The ffs-&gt;epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and
ffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the
spinlock ffs-&gt;eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function
is also protected by ffs-&gt;eps_lock.

Thus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs-&gt;epfiles in the
ffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix issues</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40316 | drm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40316</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind

A recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking up drm
platform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial
fix which had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b ("drm/mediatek: Fix
kobject put for component sub-drivers").

This results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and
on unbind() which could lead to a user-after-free.

Make sure to only drop the references after retrieving the driver data
by effectively reverting the previous partial fix.

Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40317 | regmap: slimbus: fix bus_context pointer in regmap init calls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40317</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The __devm_regmap_init_slimbus() started to be used instead of
__regmap_init_slimbus() after the commit mentioned above and turns out
the incorrect bus_context pointer (3rd argument) was used in
__devm_regmap_init_slimbus(). It should be just "slimbus" (which is equal
to &amp;amp;slimbus-&gt;dev). Correct it. The wcd934x codec seems to be the only or
the first user of devm_regmap_init_slimbus() but we should fix it till
the point where __devm_regmap_init_slimbus() was introduced therefore
two "Fixes" tags.

While at this, also correct the same argument in __regmap_init_slimbus().</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40318 | Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40318</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: fix crash while sending Action Frames in standalone AP Mode

Currently, whenever there is a need to transmit an Action frame,
the brcmfmac driver always uses the P2P vif to send the "actframe" IOVAR to
firmware. The P2P interfaces were available when wpa_supplicant is managing
the wlan interface.

However, the P2P interfaces are not created/initialized when only hostapd
is managing the wlan interface. And if hostapd receives an ANQP Query REQ
Action frame even from an un-associated STA, the brcmfmac driver tries
to use an uninitialized P2P vif pointer for sending the IOVAR to firmware.
This NULL pointer dereferencing triggers a driver crash.

Fix this, by always using the vif corresponding to the wdev on which the
Action frame Transmission request was initiated by the userspace. This way,
even if P2P vif is not available, the IOVAR is sent to firmware on AP vif
and the ANQP Query RESP Action frame is transmitted without crashing the
driver.

Move init_completion() for "send_af_done" from brcmf_p2p_create_p2pdev()
to brcmf_p2p_attach(). Because the former function would not get executed
when only hostapd is managing wlan interface, and it is not safe to do
reinit_completion() later in brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame(), without any prior
init_completion().

And in the brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame() function, the condition check for
P2P Presence response frame is not needed, since the wpa_supplicant is
properly sending the P2P Presense Response frame on the P2P-GO vif instead
of the P2P-Device vif.

fbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*

bit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer from the
character value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font's
glyph count and read past the end of the built-in font array.
Clamp the index to the actual glyph count before computing the address.

This fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40323 | fbcon: Set fb_display[i]-&amp;gt;mode to NULL when the mode is released</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40323</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Recently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:

Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
only the memory of fb_info-&gt;modelist is freed, without setting the
corresponding fb_display[i]-&gt;mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
steps:
1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
   to register a new device /dev/fb1;
2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
   a wild pointer in fb_display[];
5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
   from fb0.

Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40324 | NFSD: Fix crash in nfsd4_read_release()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40324</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes

NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new
attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it
ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.

RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:

&gt; The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client
&gt; requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the
&gt; target file system. If the server does not support a particular
&gt; attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the
&gt; attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result
&gt; bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
&gt; attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,
&gt; no attribute values will be returned.

Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:

&gt; These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,
&gt; and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR
&gt; by a client holding an appropriate delegation.

Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated
by specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes
via GETATTR is "invalid", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the
request entirely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14207 | tushar-2223 Hotel-Management-System invoiceprint.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14207</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in tushar-2223 Hotel-Management-System up to bb1f3b3666124b888f1e4bcf51b6fba9fbb01d15.

xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number

Since commit 30f241fcf52a ("xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor

xsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto

skb control block shouldn't be used for this purpose as after transmit
xsk doesn't have control over it and other subsystems could use it. This
leads to the following kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.

The user calls fsconfig twice, but when the program exits, free() only

Regarding fc-&gt;source, there is no code in the fs context related to its
memory reclamation.

To fix this memory leak, release the source memory corresponding to ctx

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer

The PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is transferred over USB URB
packet buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The
packet sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB
descriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes
are determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than
the size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported
by syzbot.

Basically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,
it implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB
descriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at
the parameter setup time before doing any further operations.

This patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when
the packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with
ep-&gt;packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or
greater than ep-&gt;packsize[0].</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:58:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40270 | mm, swap: fix potential UAF issue for VMA readahead</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40270</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, swap: fix potential UAF issue for VMA readahead

Since commit 78524b05f1a3 ("mm, swap: avoid redundant swap device
pinning"), the common helper for allocating and preparing a folio in the
swap cache layer no longer tries to get a swap device reference
internally, because all callers of __read_swap_cache_async are already
holding a swap entry reference.  The repeated swap device pinning isn't
needed on the same swap device.

Caller of VMA readahead is also holding a reference to the target entry's
swap device, but VMA readahead walks the page table, so it might encounter
swap entries from other devices, and call __read_swap_cache_async on
another device without holding a reference to it.

So it is possible to cause a UAF when swapoff of device A raced with
swapin on device B, and VMA readahead tries to read swap entries from
device A.  It's not easy to trigger, but in theory, it could cause real
issues.

Make VMA readahead try to get the device reference first if the swap
device is a different one from the target entry.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:58:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40271 | fs/proc: fix uaf in proc_readdir_de()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40271</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc: fix uaf in proc_readdir_de()

Pde is erased from subdir rbtree through rb_erase(), but not set the node
to EMPTY, which may result in uaf access.  We should use RB_CLEAR_NODE()
set the erased node to EMPTY, then pde_subdir_next() will return NULL to
avoid uaf access.

We found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase
getdent and tun in the same time.  The steps of the issue is as follows:

1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current
   pde is tun3;

2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase
   them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the
   pde(tun2) will be released to slab;

3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return
   pde(tun2) which is released, it will case uaf access.

mm/secretmem: fix use-after-free race in fault handler

When a page fault occurs in a secret memory file created with
`memfd_secret(2)`, the kernel will allocate a new folio for it, mark the
underlying page as not-present in the direct map, and add it to the file
mapping.

If two tasks cause a fault in the same page concurrently, both could end
up allocating a folio and removing the page from the direct map, but only
one would succeed in adding the folio to the file mapping.  The task that
failed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again
and (b) putting the page back into the direct map.  However, by doing
these two operations in this order, the page becomes available to the
allocator again before it is placed back in the direct mapping.

If another task attempts to allocate the page between (a) and (b), and the
kernel tries to access it via the direct map, it would result in a
supervisor not-present page fault.

Fix the ordering to restore the direct map before the folio is freed.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:58:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40273 | NFSD: free copynotify stateid in nfs4_free_ol_stateid()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40273</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: free copynotify stateid in nfs4_free_ol_stateid()

Typically copynotify stateid is freed either when parent's stateid
is being close/freed or in nfsd4_laundromat if the stateid hasn't
been used in a lease period.

However, in case when the server got an OPEN (which created
a parent stateid), followed by a COPY_NOTIFY using that stateid,
followed by a client reboot. New client instance while doing
CREATE_SESSION would force expire previous state of this client.
It leads to the open state being freed thru release_openowner-&gt;
nfs4_free_ol_stateid() and it finds that it still has copynotify
stateid associated with it. We currently print a warning and is
triggerred

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 8858 at fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:1550 nfs4_free_ol_stateid+0xb0/0x100 [nfsd]

This patch, instead, frees the associated copynotify stateid here.

If the parent stateid is freed (without freeing the copynotify
stateids associated with it), it leads to the list corruption
when laundromat ends up freeing the copynotify state later.

Deliberately don't acquire filemap invalid lock when the file is dying as
the lifecycle of f_mapping is outside the purview of KVM.  Dereferencing

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd

In snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface
Association Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this
call fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next
interface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()
assumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,
without performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.

This patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in
snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.

This issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending
a crafted USB device descriptor.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:58:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40276 | drm/panthor: Flush shmem writes before mapping buffers CPU-uncached</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40276</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size

We found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a
Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is
malformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and
SYS_pwrite64 — can cause the kernel to hang.

Root cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()
does not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,
the system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS
issue.

This patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent

drm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices

Previously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)
triggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root
cause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,
but that `man-&gt;bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains
uninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully
set up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to
acquire `man-&gt;bdev-&gt;lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man-&gt;bdev`, leading to
a kernel OOPS.

1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in
   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for
   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized
   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific
   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.

2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info
   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM
   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man-&gt;bdev` when it is
   NULL.

3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)
   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the
   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set
   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).

This approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:
- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),
- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,
- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized
  `man-&gt;bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).

v4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&amp;amp;adev-&gt;mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev-&gt;gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian)</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:58:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40289 | drm/amdgpu: hide VRAM sysfs attributes on GPUs without VRAM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40289</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
