In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:45:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32969 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rest-server allows SQL injection in query endpoint of REST API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32969</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform.

However, this host should not be accessible to the public network as it does not serve the general traffic.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:17:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1054 | UiCore Elements – Free Elementor widgets and templates &amp;lt;= 1.0.16 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Multiple Widgets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1054</link><description>The UiCore Elements – Free Elementor widgets and templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the UI Counter, UI Icon Box, UI Testimonial Slider, UI Testimonial Grid, and UI Testimonial Carousel widgets in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys.
