Prior to 
5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16.

Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29640 | Phpgurukul Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) – Testing Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /patient-report.php via the param...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29640</link><description>Phpgurukul Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) – Testing Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /patient-report.php via the parameter searchdata..</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30157 | Envoy crashes when HTTP ext_proc processes local replies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30157</link><description>Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy.

Prior to 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3, go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO` times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to transmit its identity, there are network connectivity issues, or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections, you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3. You can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the client instance.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:30:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2555 | Audi Universal Traffic Recorder App FTP Credentials hard-coded password</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2555</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Audi Universal Traffic Recorder App 2.0.

Prior to 0.26.3, the identified vulnerability allows creating or deleting an object via the APIExport VirtualWorkspace in any arbitrary target workspace for pre-existing resources. By design, this should only be allowed when the workspace owner decides to give access to an API provider by creating an APIBinding. With this vulnerability, it is possible for an attacker to create and delete objects even if none of these requirements are satisfied, i.e. even if there is no APIBinding in that workspace at all or the workspace owner has created an APIBinding, but rejected a permission claim. A fix for this issue has been identified and has been published with kcp 0.26.3 and 0.27.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:54:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29914 | OWASP Coraza WAF has parser confusion which leads to wrong URI in `REQUEST_FILENAME`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29914</link><description>OWASP Coraza WAF is a golang modsecurity compatible web application firewall library.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in Apache Druid.

This issue affects all previous Druid versions.


When using the Druid management proxy, a request that has a specially crafted URL could be used to redirect the request to an arbitrary server instead. This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druid's out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work properly, but core functionality is unaffected.


Users are recommended to upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13558 | NP Quote Request for WooCommerce &amp;lt;= 1.9.179 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13558</link><description>The NP Quote Request for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.179 due to missing validation on a user controlled key.
