The HtmlGenerator class is subject to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through a parsed malformed Minecraft server MOTD. The HtmlGenerator iterates through objects of MotdItem that are contained in an object of MotdItemCollection to generate a HTML string. An attacker can make malicious inputs to the color and text properties of MotdItem to inject own HTML into a web page during web page generation. For example by sending a malicious MOTD from a Minecraft server under their control that was queried and passed to the HtmlGenerator. This XSS vulnerability exists because the values of these properties are neither filtered nor escaped. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 14:31:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9515 | D-Link DIR-605L formSetQoS buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9515</link><description>A vulnerability was found in D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01 BETA.

Configuration supplied through APP_CONFIG_* environment variables, for example APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port=7007, where unexpectedly ignoring the visibility defined in configuration schema. This occurred even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration, but now clearly goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend package. As a temporary measure, avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration pattern. Consider alternative methods for setting secrets, such as the environment substitution available for Backstage configuration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7824 | Type-confusion vulnerability that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7824</link><description>Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrUrl.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7825 | Type confusion that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7825</link><description>Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrUrl.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7826 | Unhandled exception vulnerability that can cause the WRSA.exe service to crash and generate a crash dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7826</link><description>Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Webroot SecureAnywhere - Web Shield on Windows, ARM, 64 bit, 32 bit (wrURL.Dll modules) allows Functionality Misuse.This issue affects SecureAnywhere - Web Shield: before 2.1.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 17:30:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0125 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the nvdisam command line tool, where a user can cause a NULL pointer d...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0125</link><description>NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the nvdisam command line tool, where a user can cause a NULL pointer dereference by running nvdisasm on a malformed ELF file.

Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 16:40:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45870 | Bandisoft BandiView 7.05 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control in sub_0x3d80fc via a crafted POC file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45870</link><description>Bandisoft BandiView 7.05 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control in sub_0x3d80fc via a crafted POC file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 16:16:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25590 | Crafted responses can lead to a denial of service due to cache inefficiencies in the Recursor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25590</link><description>An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record Sets.
