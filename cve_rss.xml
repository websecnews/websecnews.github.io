This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.

For some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Environment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.
- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.
- Running with debug artifacts enabled.
- Using CodeQL Action versions &lt;= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions &gt;= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and &lt;= 2.20.2.
- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.
- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:
- Using CodeQL Action versions &gt;= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and &lt;= 3.28.2, or &gt;= 2.26.11 and &lt; 3.
- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).

In rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.

In CodeQL CLI versions &gt;= 2.9.2 and &lt;= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. 

On Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.
The intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.

Therefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.

The impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:
- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions &gt;= 3.26.11 and &lt;= 3.28.2, or &gt;= 2.26.11 and &lt; 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.
- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:34:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0702 | JoeyBling bootplus SysFileController.java unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0702</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d.

Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24355 | Updatecli may expose Maven credentials in console output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24355</link><description>Updatecli is a tool used to apply file update strategies. Prior to version 0.93.0, private maven repository credentials may be leaked in application logs in case of unsuccessful retrieval operation.

Credentials are properly sanitized when the operation is successful but not when for whatever reason there is a failure in the maven repository, e.g. wrong coordinates provided, not existing artifact or version. Version 0.93.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 16:54:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24359 | ASTEVAL Vulnerable to Maliciously Crafted Format Strings Leading to Sandbox Escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24359</link><description>ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 16:54:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22612 | Coolify Vulnerable to Private Key Enumeration on Onboarding resulting in Remote Command Execution (RCE)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22612</link><description>Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases.

In version 4.0.0-beta.358 and possibly earlier versions, when creating or updating a "project," it is possible to inject arbitrary shell commands by altering the project name. If a name includes unescaped characters, such as single quotes (`'`), it breaks out of the intended command structure, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host server, which could result in full system compromise; create, modify, or delete sensitive system files; and escalate privileges depending on the permissions of the executed process. Attackers with access to project management features could exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized control over the host environment.

Starting in version 4.0.0-beta.18 and prior to 4.0.0-beta.253, a vulnerability in the execution of commands on remote servers allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the local Coolify container, gaining access to data and private keys or tokens of other users/teams. The ability to inject malicious commands into the Coolify container gives authenticated attackers the ability to fully retrieve and control the data and availability of the software. Centrally hosted Coolify instances (open registration and/or multiple teams with potentially untrustworthy users) are especially at risk, as sensitive data of all users and connected servers can be leaked by any user. Additionally, attackers are able to modify the running software, potentially deploying malicious images to remote nodes or generally changing its behavior. Version 4.0.0-beta.253 patches this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 15:17:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9494 | Uncontrolled search path can lead to DLL hijacking in CP210 VCP Win 2k installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9494</link><description>DLL hijacking vulnerabilities, caused by an uncontrolled search path in the

This CVE was originally reserved in 2021 and later publicly disclosed by Replicated on their website on 21 October 2021. However, it mistakenly remained in the Reserved But Public (RBP) status with the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). Please note that this product reached its end of life on 31 December 2024. Publishing this CVE with the CNA was required to comply with CNA rules, despite the fact that the issue was disclosed and fixed four years ago, and the affected product is no longer supported as of 2024.

Summary of VulnerabilityThis advisory discloses a low severity security vulnerability in the versions of Replicated Classic listed above (“Affected Replicated Classic Versions”)

DescriptionReplicated Classic versions prior to 2.53.1 have an authenticated API from the Replicated Admin Console that may expose sensitive data including application secrets, depending on how the application manifests are written. A user with valid credentials and access to the Admin Console port (8800) on the Replicated Classic server can retrieve container definitions including environment variables which may contain passwords and other secrets depending on how the application is configured.

This data is shared over authenticated sessions to the Admin Console only, and was never displayed or used in the application processing. To remediate this issue, we removed the sensitive data from the API, sending only the data to the Admin Console that was needed.

TimelineThis issue was discovered during a security review on 16 September 2021.
Patched versions were released on 23 September 2021.
This advisory was published on 21 October 2021.

Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs. When debug logging is enabled, user access tokens are inadvertently logged, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data. Similarly, Kerberos Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs) are logged when debug logging is enabled. Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the **logon compliance script issue**, disable the `logon_script` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf`, and avoid using the `-d` flag when starting the `himmelblaud` daemon. For the Kerberos CCache issue, one may disable debug logging globally by setting the `debug` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf` to `false` and avoiding the `-d` parameter when starting `himmelblaud`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:44:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45672 | IBM Security Verify Bridge data manipulation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45672</link><description>IBM Security Verify Bridge 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 could allow a local privileged user to overwrite files due to excessive privileges granted to the agent. which could also cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:38:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55929 | Mail spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55929</link><description>Mail spoofing</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:38:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22153 | try/except* clauses could allow bypass RestrictedPython via type confusion bug in the CPython interpreter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22153</link><description>RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment.

netfilter: nf_set_pipapo: fix initial map fill

The initial buffer has to be inited to all-ones, but it must restrict
it to the size of the first field, not the total field size.

After each round in the map search step, the result and the fill map
are swapped, so if we have a set where f-&gt;bsize of the first element
is smaller than m-&gt;bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future
rounds result map.

This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where
first field size is not the largest.

Followup patch adds a test case to nft_concat_range.sh selftest script.

Thanks to Stefano Brivio for pointing out that we need to zero out
the remainder explicitly, only correcting memset() argument isn't enough.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 14:13:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10539 | Reflected XSS in Uyumsoft&amp;#x27;s ERP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10539</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Uyumsoft Informatin Systems Uyumsoft ERP allows XSS Using Invalid Characters, Reflected XSS.This issue affects Uyumsoft ERP: before Erp4.2109.166p45.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 13:36:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23006 | Pre-authentication deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability has been identified in the SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) and...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23006</link><description>Pre-authentication deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability has been identified in the SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) and Central Management Console (CMC), which in specific conditions could potentially enable a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 11:45:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12118 | The Events Calendar &amp;lt;= 6.9.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12118</link><description>The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Event Calendar Link Widget through the html_tag attribute in all versions up to, and including, 6.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

A user with access to the Kubernetes cluster can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies managed by any version of Envoy Gateway prior to 1.2.6. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data). Version 1.2.6 fixes the issue. As a workaround, the `EnvoyProxy` API can be used to apply a bootstrap config patch that restricts access strictly to the prometheus stats endpoint. Find below an example of such a bootstrap patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 03:29:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42186 | HCL BigFix Patch Download Plug-ins are affected by an insecure protocol support</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42186</link><description>BigFix Patch Download Plug-ins are affected by an insecure protocol support.
