Versions prior to 3.9.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 has been released and fully mitigates both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 20:24:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51154 | Jizhicms v2.5 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file download vulnerability via the component /admin/c/PluginsController.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51154</link><description>Jizhicms v2.5 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file download vulnerability via the component /admin/c/PluginsController.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:37:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51812 | Tenda AX3 v16.03.12.11 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the list parameter at /goform/SetNetControl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51812</link><description>Tenda AX3 v16.03.12.11 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the list parameter at /goform/SetNetControlList.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:37:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6270 | Kernel: aoe: improper reference count leads to use-after-free vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6270</link><description>A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 17:12:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6551 | Stored XSS in class.upload.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6551</link><description>As a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform an in-depth check on uploaded files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration is used.

The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:53:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-3726 | OCSInventory-ocsreports 2.12.0 - Stored cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3726</link><description>OCSInventory allow stored email template with special characters that lead to a Stored cross-site Scripting.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:42:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50862 | Travel Website v1.0 - Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections (SQLi)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50862</link><description>Travel Website v1.0 is vulnerable to multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

Prior to version 4.90.0, Vapor's `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when parsing a URI's components, which may cause integer overflows when parsing untrusted inputs. This vulnerability does not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating user input. The URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behavior to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted destination. By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result, spoof the host. Version 4.90.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, validate user input before parsing as a URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents` utilities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 17:07:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21622 | Craft CMS Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21622</link><description>Craft is a content management system.

Prior to version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the "accesKey", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46741 | CubeFS leaks magic secret key when starting Blobstore access service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46741</link><description>CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A vulnerability was found in CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 that could allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could allow them escalate privileges. CubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext format in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out operations on blobs that they otherwise do not have permissions for. For example, an attacker that has succesfully retrieved a secret key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store. The attacker can either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or they can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. The vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1.

The UserService gets instantiated when starting the server of the master component. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. For impacted users, there is no other way to mitigate the issue besides upgrading.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21910 | Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE plugins</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21910</link><description>TinyMCE versions before 5.10.0 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

A security vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available, and the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As such, the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 15:42:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-30617 | Leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30617</link><description>Kruise provides automated management of large-scale applications on Kubernetes. Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can leverage the "captured" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification. Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 15:42:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21907 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in Newtonsoft.Json</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21907</link><description>Newtonsoft.Json before version 13.0.1 is affected by a mishandling of exceptional conditions vulnerability.
