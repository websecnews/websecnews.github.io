Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29186 | Slow String Operations via MultiPart Requests in Event-Driven Functions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29186</link><description>Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime &lt;= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total maximum size of ~10KB.

Version 2.1.17 contains a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29184 | FreeScout Stored XSS to Privilege Escalation After CSP Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29184</link><description>FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to defacement of the Application.

Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29385 | DIR-845L router &lt;= v1.01KRb03 has an Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the cgibin binary via soapcgi_main function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29385</link><description>DIR-845L router &lt;= v1.01KRb03 has an Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the cgibin binary via soapcgi_main function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 17:13:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2822 | DedeCMS vote_edit.php cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2822</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in DedeCMS 5.7.

If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served.
