The verification is unconditionally skipped when the POST body includes verification_override=1. Because this value is attacker-supplied, an unauthenticated actor can submit a forged IPN and have it treated as verified, even on production sites and with verification otherwise enabled. A valid PayPal transaction id is needed, restricting order manipulation to orders placed by the attacker.  This, in turn, requires them to have a customer account.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 04:51:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12563 | Blog2Social: Social Media Auto Post &amp;amp; Scheduler &amp;lt;= 8.6.0 - Incorrect Authorization to Video File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12563</link><description>The Blog2Social: Social Media Auto Post &amp; Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited file upload due to an incorrect capability check on theuploadVideo() function in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.0.

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the show_editsub_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary subscribers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 04:01:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10683 | Easy Email Subscription &amp;lt;= 1.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) SQL Injection via uid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10683</link><description>The Easy Email Subscription plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'uid' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 03:34:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64164 | DataEase is vulnerable to Oracle JNDI Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64164</link><description>Dataease is an open source data visualization analysis tool.

In versions 0.5.6 and below, youki’s apparmor handling performs insufficiently strict write-target validation, and when combined with path substitution during pathname resolution, can allow writes to unintended procfs locations. While resolving a path component-by-component, a shared-mount race can substitute intermediate components and redirect the final target. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 23:19:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55278 | HCL DevOps Loop is susceptible to an improper authentication vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55278</link><description>Improper authentication in the API authentication middleware of HCL DevOps Loop allows authentication tokens to be accepted without proper validation of their expiration and cryptographic signature.

Under certain circumstances, a local user may be able to extract another local user's authentication token from the shared client machine and access their WorkSpace.

To mitigate this issue, users should upgrade to the Amazon WorkSpaces client for Linux version 2025.0 or later.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 21:33:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60784 | A vulnerability in the XiaozhangBang Voluntary Like System V8.8 allows remote attackers to manipulate the zhekou parameter in the /topfirst....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60784</link><description>A vulnerability in the XiaozhangBang Voluntary Like System V8.8 allows remote attackers to manipulate the zhekou parameter in the /topfirst.php Pay module, enabling unauthorized discounts. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with zhekou set to an abnormally low value, an attacker can purchase votes at a reduced cost. Furthermore, by modifying the zid parameter, attackers can influence purchases made by other users, amplifying the impact. This issue stems from insufficient server-side validation of these parameters, potentially leading to economic loss and unfair manipulation of vote counts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 20:50:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63585 | OSSN (Open Source Social Network) 8.6 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /action/rtcomments/status via the timestamp parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-63585</link><description>OSSN (Open Source Social Network) 8.6 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /action/rtcomments/status via the timestamp parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 20:38:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63334 | PocketVJ CP PocketVJ-CP-v3 pvj version 3.9.1 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the submit_opacity.php compo...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-63334</link><description>PocketVJ CP PocketVJ-CP-v3 pvj version 3.9.1 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the submit_opacity.php component.

In versions 2.3.0 and below, the htmlKeywordsFromUrl function in the FetchController class accepts user-provided URLs and makes HTTP requests to them without validating that the destination is not an internal or private network resource. This Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to use the application server to perform port scanning and service discovery on internal networks. Practical impact is very limited because the function only extracts content from HTML meta keywords tags, which prevents meaningful data exfiltration from databases, APIs, or cloud metadata endpoints. This issue is fixed in version 2.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 22:09:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54496 | Fuji Electric Monitouch V-SFT-6 Heap-based Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54496</link><description>A maliciously crafted project file may cause a heap-based buffer

Versions 2.27.1 and below allow attackers to permanently corrupt issue activity logs by submitting extremely long notes (tested with 4,788,761 characters) due to a lack of server-side validation of note length. Once such a note is added, the activity stream UI fails to render; therefore, new notes cannot be displayed, effectively breaking all future collaboration on the issue. This issue is fixed in version 2.27.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 01:58:40 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
