Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the `context` variable is injected into almost any Twig Template and allows to access to current language, currency information. The context object allows also to switch for a short time the scope of the Context as a helper with a callable function. The function can be called also from Twig and as the second parameter allows any callable, it's possible to call from Twig any statically callable PHP function/method. It's not possible as customer to provide any Twig code, the attacker would require access to Administration to exploit it using Mail templates or using App Scripts.

The store-API works with regular entities and not expose all fields for the public API; fields need to be marked as ApiAware in the EntityDefinition. So only ApiAware fields of the EntityDefinition will be encoded to the final JSON. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the processing of the Criteria did not considered ManyToMany associations and so they were not considered properly and the protections didn't get used. This issue cannot be reproduced with the default entities by Shopware, but can be triggered with extensions. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch.

Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.
In effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 14:39:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7348 | PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg_dump executes arbitrary SQL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7348</link><description>Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg_dump, which is often a superuser.

gpio: pca953x: fix pca953x_irq_bus_sync_unlock race

Ensure that `i2c_lock' is held when setting interrupt latch and mask in
pca953x_irq_bus_sync_unlock() in order to avoid races.

The other (non-probe) call site pca953x_gpio_set_multiple() ensures the
lock is held before calling pca953x_write_regs().

The problem occurred when a request raced against irq_bus_sync_unlock()
approximately once per thousand reboots on an i.MX8MP based system.

cifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retry

When a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will call
cifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the op
before renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() which
invokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.

If a different server is then selected, this causes the increment of
server-&gt;in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happen
against another, leading to misaccounting.

Fix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As this
is only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() should
always have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and the
preparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.

The problem manifests as a warning looking something like:

 WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 72896 at fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c:97 smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs]

Which may be triggered by a number of different xfstests running against an
Azure server in multichannel mode.  generic/249 seems the most repeatable,
but generic/215, generic/249 and generic/308 may also show it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 08:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42257 | ext4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42257</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When a role-based access control (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 16:54:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20450 | Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA5...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20450</link><description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.

libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()

The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to
races with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of
these can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of
the following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()
runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order
to avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was
missed in commit b5d91704f53e ("libceph: behave in mon_fault() if
cur_mon &lt; 0") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objects
that hang off of it, with monc-&gt;auth and monc-&gt;monmap being
particularly susceptible to quickly being reused.

To fix this:

- clear monc-&gt;cur_mon and monc-&gt;hunting as part of closing the session
  in ceph_monc_stop()
- bail from delayed_work() if monc-&gt;cur_mon is cleared, similar to how
  it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc-&gt;hunting)
- call cancel_delayed_work_sync() after the session is closed</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42233 | filemap: replace pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42233</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The vmf-&gt;ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set from
handle_pte_fault().  But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf-&gt;pte). 
After a pte_unmap(vmf-&gt;pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table
may be racily changed and vmf-&gt;ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page
table.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with
pte_offset_map_nolock().

As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use
it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, if
the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 ("filemap: avoid

mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration

Even on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive "Bad page state"s (often on
flags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been
set and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from
deferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN
symptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.

6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 ("mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large
folio migration") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in
85ce2c517ade ("memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration"),
but missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own
local list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time
folio-&gt;_deferred_list is not empty, but even the "right" lock does nothing
to secure the folio and the list it is on.

Fortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so
folio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()
while the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding
such a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and
unmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing
was needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42235 | s390/mm: Add NULL pointer check to crst_table_free() base_crst_free()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42235</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled

Given a schedule:

timer1 cb			timer2 cb

bpf_timer_cancel(timer2);	bpf_timer_cancel(timer1);

Both bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish
executing, introducing a lockup.

Add an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps
track of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.
Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding
cancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an
error (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the
callback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock
situation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel
and attempting to cancel one another.

Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target
timer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from
a callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting
cur-&gt;cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop
(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the
caller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to
cancel as it sees fit without running into errors.

Background on prior attempts:

Earlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the
following pattern under timer-&gt;lock to publish cancellation status.

lock(t-&gt;lock);
t-&gt;cancelling = true;
mb();
if (cur-&gt;cancelling)
	return -EDEADLK;
unlock(t-&gt;lock);
hrtimer_cancel(t-&gt;timer);
t-&gt;cancelling = false;

The store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel
requests t-&gt;cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely
executing callback observes its cancellation status.

It would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel
is done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was
explored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the
timer under timer-&gt;lock. This would ensure serialized access to the
cancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight
hrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur
again.

Thus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding
cancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks
attempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42240 | x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42240</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation

When BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set
then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the
clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler
(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the
entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.

To address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY
after making sure the TF flag is cleared.

The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:

  $ cat sysenter_step.c
  int main()
  { asm("pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter"); }

  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c

  $ ./sysenter_step
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

The program is expected to crash, and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

Fix it by disabling PMD-sized page cache when HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is larger
than MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.  As Matthew Wilcox pointed, the page cache in a
shmem file isn't represented by a multi-index entry and doesn't have this
limitation when the xarry entry is split until commit 6b24ca4a1a8d ("mm:

mm/filemap: make MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER acceptable to xarray

Patch series "mm/filemap: Limit page cache size to that supported by
xarray", v2.

Currently, xarray can't support arbitrary page cache size.  More details
can be found from the WARN_ON() statement in xas_split_alloc().  In our
test whose code is attached below, we hit the WARN_ON() on ARM64 system
where the base page size is 64KB and huge page size is 512MB.  The issue
was reported long time ago and some discussions on it can be found here
[1].

[1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg75404.html

In order to fix the issue, we need to adjust MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER to one
supported by xarray and avoid PMD-sized page cache if needed.  The code
changes are suggested by David Hildenbrand.

PATCH[1] adjusts MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER to that supported by xarray
PATCH[2-3] avoids PMD-sized page cache in the synchronous readahead path
PATCH[4] avoids PMD-sized page cache for shmem files if needed

USB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resume

Since commit c49cfa917025 ("USB: serial: use generic method if no
alternative is provided in usb serial layer"), USB serial core calls the
generic resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.

This can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for
multiple read URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port read
URBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer
of the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port
structure.

Fix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for
mos7840.

Tested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.

Revert "sched/fair: Make sure to try to detach at least one movable task"

This reverts commit b0defa7ae03ecf91b8bfd10ede430cff12fcbd06.

b0defa7ae03ec changed the load balancing logic to ignore env.max_loop if
all tasks examined to that point were pinned. The goal of the patch was
to make it more likely to be able to detach a task buried in a long list
of pinned tasks. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of
creating an O(n) iteration in detach_tasks(), as we now must fully
iterate every task on a cpu if all or most are pinned. Since this load
balance code is done with rq lock held, and often in softirq context, it
is very easy to trigger hard lockups. We observed such hard lockups with
a user who affined O(10k) threads to a single cpu.

When I discussed this with Vincent he initially suggested that we keep
the limit on the number of tasks to detach, but increase the number of
tasks we can search. However, after some back and forth on the mailing
list, he recommended we instead revert the original patch, as it seems
likely no one was actually getting hit by the original issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42246 | net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42246</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket

When using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This
causes xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing
the kernel to potentially freeze up.

Neil suggested:

  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready
  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more
  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.

ECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error
can be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels
which do not have f10d05966196 ("bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err
instead of allow boolean"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for
consistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request().</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42247 | wireguard: allowedips: avoid unaligned 64-bit memory accesses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42247</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: allowedips: avoid unaligned 64-bit memory accesses

On the parisc platform, the kernel issues kernel warnings because
swap_endian() tries to load a 128-bit IPv6 address from an unaligned
memory location:

 Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f4688c in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x2c/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf3010df)
 Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f46884 in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x38/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf2010dc)

Avoid such unaligned memory accesses by instead using the
get_unaligned_be64() helper macro.

spi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async()

Calling spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() in spi_async() is wrong because
the message is likely to be in the queue and not transferred yet. This
can corrupt the message while it is being used by the controller driver.

spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() is already called in the correct place
in spi_finalize_current_message() to balance the call to
spi_maybe_optimize_message() in spi_async().</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42250 | cachefiles: add missing lock protection when polling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42250</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: add missing lock protection when polling

Add missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray,
otherwise:

Even with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree is
ensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. struct
cachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee.  The poll
routine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_req
accordingly.  Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case and
spinlock is needed here.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 15:29:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7581 | Tenda A301 WifiBasicSet formWifiBasicSet stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7581</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Tenda A301 15.13.08.12.
