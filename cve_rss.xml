The vulnerability resides in POSTed editor parameters submitted to the /posts/edit/{id} endpoint (and similarly in Notice and Pages editors). Due to insufficient input sanitization and output encoding, attackers can inject HTML/JS payloads. The payload is saved and later rendered unsanitized, resulting in JavaScript execution in other users' browsers when they access the affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not enforce a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate filtering to prevent such attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:35:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59532 | Codex has sandbox bypass due to bug in path configuration logic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59532</link><description>Codex CLI is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally. In versions 0.2.0 to 0.38.0, due to a bug in the sandbox configuration logic, Codex CLI could treat a model-generated cwd as the sandbox’s writable root, including paths outside of the folder where the user started their session. This logic bypassed the intended workspace boundary and enables arbitrary file writes and command execution where the Codex process has permissions - this did not impact the network-disabled sandbox restriction. This issue has been patched in Codex CLI 0.39.0 that canonicalizes and validates that the boundary used for sandbox policy is based on where the user started the session, and not the one generated by the model. Users running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced. If using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to 0.4.12 for a fix of the sandbox issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10813 | code-projects Hostel Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10813</link><description>A vulnerability was found in code-projects Hostel Management System 1.0.

In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59527 | FlowiseAI/Flowise has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59527</link><description>Flowise is a drag &amp; drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow.

Prior to version 3.2, a timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client proofs and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1 by replacing Arrays.equals with MessageDigest.isEqual, which ensures constant-time comparison.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:28:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57203 | MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to aut...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57203</link><description>MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to authenticated admin users.

Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10811 | code-projects Hostel Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10811</link><description>A flaw has been found in code-projects Hostel Management System 1.0.

This interface, referred to as the "ATEM Ethernet Protocol 1.0", provides complete device control without requiring credentials or encryption. An attacker on the same network (or with remote access to the exposed port) can exploit this interface to execute arbitrary streaming commands, erase disks, or shut down the device - effectively gaining full remote control.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:42:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57438 | The 2wcom IP-4c 2.15.5 device suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability.

Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker’s access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59411 | CubeCart Stored/Reflected HTML Injection Vulnerability in Contact Enquiry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59411</link><description>CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution.

When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:32:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57602 | Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH priv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57602</link><description>Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH private key, allows remote attackers to authenticate to the cloud controller, gain interactive shell access, and pivot into other connected IoT devices.
