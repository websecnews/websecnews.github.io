This occurs despite the presence of proper page table entries and valid memory access modes. The fault is reproducible when transitioning into virtual memory and attempting store operations in mapped kernel memory, indicating a potential flaw in the MMU, PMP, or memory access enforcement logic. This may cause unexpected kernel panics or denial of service in systems using BOOMv1.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50579 | A CORS misconfiguration in Nginx Proxy Manager v2.12.3 allows unauthorized domains to access sensitive data, particularly JWT tokens, due to...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50579</link><description>A CORS misconfiguration in Nginx Proxy Manager v2.12.3 allows unauthorized domains to access sensitive data, particularly JWT tokens, due to improper validation of the Origin header.

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

This issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.



When using the API Ognl.getValue​, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods,
 etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. 
Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.


NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:14:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8098 | An improper permission vulnerability was reported in Lenovo PC Manager that could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8098</link><description>An improper permission vulnerability was reported in Lenovo PC Manager that could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:14:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32992 | Thermo Fisher Scientific ePort through 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32992</link><description>Thermo Fisher Scientific ePort through 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:14:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55213 | OpenFGA Authorization Bypass (Check)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55213</link><description>OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar.

From 7.1.0 to before 9.9.1, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the --UNSAFE,--trust flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination path where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering a generated directory structure whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path. Constructing such paths is possible using Copier's builtin pathjoin Jinja filter and its builtin _copier_conf.sep variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55201 | Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read/write access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55201</link><description>Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to 9.9.1, a safe template can currently read and write arbitrary files because Copier exposes a few pathlib.Path objects in the Jinja context which have unconstrained I/O methods. This effectively renders the security model w.r.t. filesystem access useless. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55205 | Capsule tenant owners with &amp;quot;patch namespace&amp;quot; permission can hijack system namespaces label</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55205</link><description>Capsule is a multi-tenancy and policy-based framework for Kubernetes. A namespace label injection vulnerability in Capsule v0.10.3 and earlier allows authenticated tenant users to inject arbitrary labels into system namespaces (kube-system, default, capsule-system), bypassing multi-tenant isolation and potentially accessing cross-tenant resources through TenantResource selectors. This vulnerability enables privilege escalation and violates the fundamental security boundaries that Capsule is designed to enforce. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.10.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54117 | NamelessMC allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in dashboard text editor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54117</link><description>NamelessMC is a free, easy to use &amp; powerful website software for Minecraft servers.

An application can be vulnerable when all the following are true:

  *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded Servlet container
  *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization 
  *  the application  serves static resources https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title  with Spring resource handling


We have verified that applications deployed on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not disabled in the configuration. Because we cannot check exploits against all Servlet containers and configuration variants, we strongly recommend upgrading your application.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47206 | File Station 5</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47206</link><description>An out-of-bounds write vulnerability has been reported to affect File Station 5.
