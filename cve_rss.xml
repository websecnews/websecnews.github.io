This issue affects Apache Lucene's replicator module: from 4.4.0 before 9.12.0.
The deprecated org.apache.lucene.replicator.http package is affected.
The org.apache.lucene.replicator.nrt package is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.12.0, which fixes the issue.

Java serialization filters (such as -Djdk.serialFilter='!*' on the commandline) can mitigate the issue on vulnerable versions without impacting functionality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 09:13:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6394 | Local File Inclusion in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6394</link><description>A Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in parisneo/lollms-webui versions below v9.8.

The victim is not required to join a game session with an attacker. The victim must open the "Wireless Play" (or "LAN Play") menu from the game's title screen, and an attacker nearby (LDN) or on the same LAN network as the victim can send a crafted reply packet to the victim's console. This enables a remote attacker to obtain complete denial-of-service on the game's process, or potentially, remote code execution on the victim's console. The issue is caused by incorrect use of the Nintendo Pia library,</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 07:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8458 | PLANET Technology switch devices - Cross-site Request Forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8458</link><description>Certain switch models from PLANET Technology have a web application that is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
