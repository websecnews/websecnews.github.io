drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation

Calculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value
between the requested size and the actual size does not consider
the partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.

Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the
total size is now deduced from the difference between the end and
start addresses.

Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer
and more understandable form.

The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant time string comparison of the received &amp; configured bearer tokens. This impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. The observable timing vulnerability was fixed by using constant-time comparison in  0.107.0</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 19:38:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7738 | yzane vscode-markdown-pdf Markdown File pathname traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7738</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in yzane vscode-markdown-pdf 1.5.0.

The mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented in Apache MINA SSHD 2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade to at least this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:27:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42489 | Pro Macros Remote Code Execution via Viewpdf and similar macros</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42489</link><description>Pro Macros provides XWiki rendering macros.

mm: huge_memory: use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines

Yves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 ("mm: huge_memory: don't
force huge page alignment on 32 bit") didn't work for x86_32 [1].  It is
because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.

!CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.
