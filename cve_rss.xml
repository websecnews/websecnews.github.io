When the default authentication method is used, a random password is generated for the "admin" user and is persisted in either a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume in a plaintext file. This authentication method can be manipulated by an attacker, leading to the reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem, directly impacting data confidentiality. Additionally, the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 03:38:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47515 | Pagure: generate_archive() follows symbolic links in temporary clones</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47515</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Pagure.

In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application's handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template. If the input is rendered without sufficient sanitization, it results in the execution of malicious Jinja2 code on the server.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:33:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53275 | GHSL-2024-091: DNS rebinding attack in home-gallery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53275</link><description>Home-Gallery.org is a self-hosted open-source web gallery to browse personal photos and videos. In 1.15.0 and earlier, the default setup of home-gallery is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Home-gallery is set up without TLS and user authentication by default, leaving it vulnerable to DNS rebinding. In this attack, an attacker will ask a user to visit their website. The attacker website will then change the DNS records of their domain from their IP address to the internal IP address of the home-gallery instance. To tell which IP addresses are valid, we can rebind a subdomain to each IP address we want to check, and see if there is a response. Once potential candidates have been found, the attacker can launch the attack by reading the response of the web server after the IP address has changed. When the attacker domain is fetched, the response will be from the home-gallery instance, not the attacker website, because the IP address has been changed. Due to a lack of authentication, home-gallery photos can then be extracted by the attacker website.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:22:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53276 | GHSL-2024-092: Open CORS policy in home-gallery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53276</link><description>Home-Gallery.org is a self-hosted open-source web gallery to browse personal photos and videos. In 1.15.0 and earlier, an open CORS policy in app.js may allow an attacker to view the images of home-gallery when it is using the default settings. The following express middleware allows any website to make a cross site request to home-gallery, thus allowing them to read any endpoint on home-gallery. Home-gallery is mostly safe from cross-site requests due to most of its pages requiring JavaScript, and cross-site requests such as fetch() do not render javascript. If an attacker is able to get the path of the preview images which are randomized, an attacker will be able to view such a photo. If any static files or endpoints are introduced in the future that contain sensitive information, they will be accessible to an attacker website.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:22:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40896 | In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce events for external entities even if c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40896</link><description>In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce events for external entities even if custom SAX handlers try to override entity content (by setting "checked").

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:52:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56201 | Jinja has a sandbox breakout through malicious filenames</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56201</link><description>Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename.

Apache Hive’s service component accidentally exposes the signed cookie to the end user when there is a mismatch in signature between the current and expected cookie. Exposing the correct cookie signature can lead to further exploitation.

The vulnerable CookieSigner logic was introduced in Apache Hive by HIVE-9710 (1.2.0) and in Apache Spark by SPARK-14987 (2.0.0). The affected components are the following:

A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:28:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55539 | Weak algorithm used to sign RPM package.

A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a Manifest RPKI object containing an empty fileList. Fort dereferences (and, shortly afterwards, writes to) this array during a shuffle attempt, before the validation that would normally reject it when empty. This out-of-bounds access is caused by an integer underflow that causes the surrounding loop to iterate infinitely. Because the product is permanently stuck attempting to overshuffle an array that doesn't actually exist, a crash is nearly guaranteed.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 22:30:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56312 | A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Project Dashboard name of REDCap through 15.0.0 allows authenticated users to injec...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56312</link><description>A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Project Dashboard name of REDCap through 15.0.0 allows authenticated users to inject malicious scripts into the name field of a Project Dashboard.
