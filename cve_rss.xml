A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48958 | Froxlor has an HTML Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48958</link><description>Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to version 2.2.6, an HTML Injection vulnerability in the customer account portal allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML payloads in the email section. This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, and reputational damage by redirecting users to malicious external websites. The vulnerability has a medium severity, as it can be exploited through user input without authentication. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48990 | NeKernel has Heap Overflow in `rt_copy_memory`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48990</link><description>NeKernal is a free and open-source operating system stack. Version 0.0.2 has a 1-byte heap overflow in `rt_copy_memory`, which unconditionally wrote a null terminator at `dst[len]`. When `len` equals the size of the destination buffer (256 bytes), that extra `'\0'` write overruns the buffer by one byte. To avoid breaking existing callers or changing the public API, the patch in commit fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee takes a minimal approach: it simply removes the overflow-causing line without adding bounds checks or altering the function signature.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48495 | Gokapi has stored XSS vulnerability in friendly name for API keys</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48495</link><description>Gokapi is a self-hosted file sharing server with automatic expiration and encryption support. By renaming the friendly name of an API key, an authenticated user could inject JS into the API key overview, which would also be executed when another user clicks on his API tab. Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users of versions prior to 2.0.0. If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0. A workaround would be to not open the API page if it is possible that another user might have injected code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:29:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48955 | Para Server Logs Sensitive Information</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48955</link><description>Para is a multitenant backend server/framework for object persistence and retrieval.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in CE Phoenix versions 1.0.9.9 through 1.1.0.2 where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the testimonial description field. Once submitted, if the shop owner (admin) approves the testimonial, the script executes in the context of any user visiting the testimonial page. Because the session cookies are not marked with the `HttpOnly` flag, they can be exfiltrated by the attacker — potentially leading to account takeover. Version 1.1.0.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48494 | Gokapi vulnerable to stored XSS via uploading file with malicious file name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48494</link><description>Gokapi is a self-hosted file sharing server with automatic expiration and encryption support. When using end-to-end encryption, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed. Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users using a version prior to 2.0.0. If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0. A possible workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5442 | Linksys RE6500/RE6250/RE6300/RE6350/RE7000/RE9000 RP_pingGatewayByBBS os command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5442</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linksys RE6500, RE6250, RE6300, RE6350, RE7000 and RE9000 1.0.013.001/1.0.04.001/1.0.04.002/1.1.05.003/1.2.07.001.

An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g., on a shared/public machine) could permanently delete the user’s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:58:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29785 | quic-go Has Panic in Path Probe Loss Recovery Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29785</link><description>quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:51:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3454 | This vulnerability in Grafana's datasource proxy API allows authorization checks to be bypassed by adding an extra slash character in the UR...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3454</link><description>This vulnerability in Grafana's datasource proxy API allows authorization checks to be bypassed by adding an extra slash character in the URL path.

If the function was called with malformed data, for example, an URL that
contained a "charset" parameter that lacked a value (such as
"data:charset,"), and Qt was built with assertions enabled, then it would hit an assertion, resulting in a denial of service
(abort).

This impacts Qt up to 5.15.18, 6.0.0-&gt;6.5.8, 6.6.0-&gt;6.8.3 and 6.9.0. This has been fixed in 5.15.19, 6.5.9, 6.8.4 and 6.9.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:50:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5437 | Multilaser Sirius RE016 Password Change cstecgi.cgi improper authentication</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5437</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Multilaser Sirius RE016 MLT1.0.
