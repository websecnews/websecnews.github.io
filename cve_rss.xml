HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync` extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 23:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51998 | Path traversal using file URI scheme without supplying hostname in changedetection.io</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51998</link><description>changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. The validation for the file URI scheme falls short, and results in an attacker being able to read any file on the system. This issue only affects instances with a webdriver enabled, and `ALLOW_FILE_URI` false or not defined. The check used for URL protocol, `is_safe_url`, allows `file:` as a URL scheme. It later checks if local files are permitted, but one of the preconditions for the check is that the URL starts with `file://`. The issue comes with the fact that the file URI scheme is not required to have double slashes. This issue has been addressed in version 0.47.06 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 23:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8424 | WatchGuard Endpoint Protection Privilege Escalation in PSANHost Enables Arbitrary File Delete as SYSTEM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8424</link><description>Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in WatchGuard EPDR, Panda AD360 and Panda Dome on Windows (PSANHost.exe module) allows arbitrary file delete with SYSTEM permissions.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the PasswordPusher application, affecting versions `v1.41.1` through and including `v.1.48.0`. The issue arises from an un-sanitized parameter which could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. Users who self-host and have the login system enabled are affected.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could expose user data, access to user sessions or take unintended actions on behalf of users. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to click a malicious account confirmation link. It is highly recommended to update to version `v1.48.1` or later to mitigate this risk. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Solution

Update to version `v1.48.1` or later where input sanitization has been applied to the account confirmation process.

All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some. The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support. However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself. As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by setting the export disk deliberately. This change has been included in the 3.2.123 release and all users who use the `public` disk are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 17:52:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-11916 | An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.

Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider, which uses HTTP request headers, is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands, such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues.

sched/core: Disable page allocation in task_tick_mm_cid()

With KASAN and PREEMPT_RT enabled, calling task_work_add() in
task_tick_mm_cid() may cause the following splat.

[   63.696416] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48

This problem is caused by the following call trace.

  sched_tick() [ acquire rq-&gt;__lock ]
   -&gt; task_tick_mm_cid()
    -&gt; task_work_add()
     -&gt; __kasan_record_aux_stack()

	     -&gt; __rmqueue_pcplist()
	      -&gt; rmqueue_bulk()

The rq lock is a raw_spinlock_t. We can't sleep while holding
it. IOW, we can't call alloc_pages() in stack_depot_save_flags().

The task_tick_mm_cid() function with its task_work_add() call was
introduced by commit 223baf9d17f2 ("sched: Fix performance regression
introduced by mm_cid") in v6.4 kernel.

Fortunately, there is a kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() variant that
calls stack_depot_save_flags() while not allowing it to allocate
new pages.  To allow task_tick_mm_cid() to use task_work without
page allocation, a new TWAF_NO_ALLOC flag is added to enable calling
kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() instead of kasan_record_aux_stack()
if set. The task_tick_mm_cid() function is modified to add this new flag.

The possible downside is the missing stack trace in a KASAN report due
to new page allocation required when task_work_add_noallloc() is called
which should be rare.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50141 | ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50141</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service
    WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341
        __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170
    Call trace:

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime

xfrm: validate new SA's prefixlen using SA family when sel.family is unset

This expands the validation introduced in commit 07bf7908950a ("xfrm:
Validate address prefix lengths in the xfrm selector.")

syzbot created an SA with
    usersa.sel.family = AF_UNSPEC
    usersa.sel.prefixlen_s = 128
    usersa.family = AF_INET

Because of the AF_UNSPEC selector, verify_newsa_info doesn't put
limits on prefixlen_{s,d}. But then copy_from_user_state sets
x-&gt;sel.family to usersa.family (AF_INET). Do the same conversion in
verify_newsa_info before validating prefixlen_{s,d}, since that's how
prefixlen is going to be used later on.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50143 | udf: fix uninit-value use in udf_get_fileshortad</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: fix unbalanced rpm put() with fence_fini()

Currently we can call fence_fini() twice if something goes wrong when
sending the GuC CT for the tlb request, since we signal the fence and
return an error, leading to the caller also calling fini() on the error
path in the case of stack version of the flow, which leads to an extra
rpm put() which might later cause device to enter suspend when it
shouldn't. It looks like we can just drop the fini() call since the
fence signaller side will already call this for us.

There are known mysterious splats with device going to sleep even with
an rpm ref, and this could be one candidate.

v2 (Matt B):
  - Prefer warning if we detect double fini()

octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()

build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle
it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

__octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If
skb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we
shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the
octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no
associated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them
up the network stack - they are skipped.

Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers
used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to
mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

net/mlx5e: Don't call cleanup on profile rollback failure

When profile rollback fails in mlx5e_netdev_change_profile, the netdev
profile var is left set to NULL. Avoid a crash when unloading the driver
by not calling profile-&gt;cleanup in such a case.

This was encountered while testing, with the original trigger that
the wq rescuer thread creation got interrupted (presumably due to
Ctrl+C-ing modprobe), which gets converted to ENOMEM (-12) by
mlx5e_priv_init, the profile rollback also fails for the same reason
(signal still active) so the profile is left as NULL, leading to a crash
later in _mlx5e_remove.

net/mlx5: Fix command bitmask initialization

Command bitmask have a dedicated bit for MANAGE_PAGES command, this bit
isn't Initialize during command bitmask Initialization, only during
MANAGE_PAGES.

In addition, mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() is trying to trigger
completion for MANAGE_PAGES command as well.

Hence, in case health error occurred before any MANAGE_PAGES command
have been invoke (for example, during mlx5_enable_hca()),
mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() will try to trigger completion for
MANAGE_PAGES command, which will result in null-ptr-deref error.[1]

Fix it by Initialize command bitmask correctly.

While at it, re-write the code for better understanding.

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using
'seal' mount option, the client will squash all compound request buffers
down for encryption into a single iov in smb2_set_next_command().

SMB2_ioctl_init() allocates a small buffer (448 bytes) to hold the
SMB2_IOCTL request in the first iov, and if the user passes an input
buffer that is greater than 328 bytes, smb2_set_next_command() will
end up writing off the end of @rqst-&gt;iov[0].iov_base as shown below:

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req-&gt;sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """

The commit 83fccfc3940c ("inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer-&gt;entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req-&gt;sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req-&gt;sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req-&gt;sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req-&gt;sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block-&gt;state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since "dump_addr" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print "Registers not stored" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

RDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid CPU lockups due fifo occupancy check loop

Driver waits indefinitely for the fifo occupancy to go below a threshold
as soon as the pacing interrupt is received. This can cause soft lockup on
one of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.

Add a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th
if the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until the
occupancy is below the threshold. This is ensured by the checks in
bnxt_re_pacing_timer_exp and further scheduling the work for pacing based
on the fifo occupancy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50158 | RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix out of bound check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50158</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: devmap: provide rxq after redirect

rxq contains a pointer to the device from where
the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program
that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP*
does not have it set.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.

SEC("xdp")
int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt)
{
        return bpf_redirect_map(&amp;amp;dev_redirect_map, 0, 0);
}

SEC("xdp/devmap")

{
        bpf_printk("ifindex %i", pkt-&gt;ingress_ifindex);
        return XDP_PASS;
}

depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri-&gt;flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50164 | bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT&amp;#x27;s meaning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50164</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg-&gt;var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that "the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 ("bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type")
got overloaded over time with "the passed buffer is being written to".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a ("bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn-&gt;arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed
altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the
equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:42:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50165 | bpf: Preserve param-&amp;gt;string when parsing mount options</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50165</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than
otherwise intended.

This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the
insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like
`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain
of the second host.

(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to
have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for
the domains involved to trigger this problem.)

When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this
bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the
parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.

The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get
converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by
the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its
expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the
(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry
*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier
than otherwise intended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 07:53:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10020 | Heateor Social Login WordPress &amp;lt;= 1.1.35 - Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10020</link><description>The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35.

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occurs on the Osmedues web server when viewing results from the workflow, allowing commands to be executed on the server. When using a workflow that contains the summary module, it generates reports in HTML and Markdown formats. The default report is based on the `general-template.md` template.The contents of the files are read and used to generate the report. However, the file contents are not properly filtered, leading to XSS. This may lead to commands executed on the host as well. This issue is not yet resolved. Users are advised to add their own filtering or to reach out to the developer to aid in developing a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:57:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51746 | Use of incorrect Rekor entries during verification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51746</link><description>Gitsign is a keyless Sigstore to signing tool for Git commits with your a GitHub / OIDC identity. gitsign may select the wrong Rekor entry to use during online verification when multiple entries are returned by the log. gitsign uses Rekor's search API to fetch entries that apply to a signature being verified. The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:57:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50332 | Authenticated Blind SQL Injection in DeleteRelationShip in SuiteCRM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50332</link><description>SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application.

The "Publish Key" field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions, such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script, it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users, effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog.  An attacker who successfully talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login link, or a malicious app running on a victim's computer triggering the application key workflow with specially crafted parameters and then redirecting the victim to the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have been patched in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected locations. A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general. The latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51240 | An issue in the luci-mod-rpc package in OpenWRT Luci LTS allows for privilege escalation from an admin account to root via the JSON-RPC-API,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51240</link><description>An issue in the luci-mod-rpc package in OpenWRT Luci LTS allows for privilege escalation from an admin account to root via the JSON-RPC-API, which is exposed by the luci-mod-rpc package</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51380 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability discovered in the Properties Component of JATOS v3.9.3.

scsi: ufs: core: Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down

There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning
of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFS
shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on
blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary.
After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was
waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set
SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down
after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50100 | USB: gadget: dummy-hcd: Fix &amp;quot;task hung&amp;quot; problem</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: gadget: dummy-hcd: Fix "task hung" problem

The syzbot fuzzer has been encountering "task hung" problems ever
since the dummy-hcd driver was changed to use hrtimers instead of
regular timers.  It turns out that the problems are caused by a subtle
difference between the timer_pending() and hrtimer_active() APIs.

The changeover blindly replaced the first by the second.  However,
timer_pending() returns True when the timer is queued but not when its
callback is running, whereas hrtimer_active() returns True when the
hrtimer is queued _or_ its callback is running.  This difference
occasionally caused dummy_urb_enqueue() to think that the callback
routine had not yet started when in fact it was almost finished.  As a
result the hrtimer was not restarted, which made it impossible for the
driver to dequeue later the URB that was just enqueued.  This caused
usb_kill_urb() to hang, and things got worse from there.

Since hrtimers have no API for telling when they are queued and the
callback isn't running, the driver must keep track of this for itself.
That's what this patch does, adding a new "timer_pending" flag and
setting or clearing it at the appropriate times.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50101 | iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50101</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices

Previously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called

This could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.

Add a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For
non-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50102 | x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50102</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue

It turns out that AMD has a "Meltdown Lite(tm)" issue with non-canonical
accesses in kernel space.  And so using just the high bit to decide
whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good
old "leak speculative data" if you have the right gadget using the
result:

  CVE-2020-12965 “Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses“

Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those
instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,
which closes the speculation window.

But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].
That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the
speculation window is now open.

Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the
regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm
version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.

It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's no
speculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50103 | ASoC: qcom: Fix NULL Dereference in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc

Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to
soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
similar issue).</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50106 | nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid

There is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations
and a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread
finds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it
marks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list
but then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation
happens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing
free_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls
list_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees
the delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not
calling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation
but that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on
the file.

Now, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that
lease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends
up trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the
followint use-after-free KASAN warning:

This patch proposes a fixed that's based on adding 2 new additional
stid's sc_status values that help coordinate between the laundromat
and other operations (nfsd4_free_stateid() and nfsd4_delegreturn()).

First to make sure, that once the stid is marked revoked, it is not
removed by the nfsd4_free_stateid(), the laundromat take a reference
on the stateid. Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put
on the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to
make sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act
accordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before
the arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove
it from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived
before laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state
freed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.

Also, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,
we need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means
the laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this
delegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not
nfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the
lack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50107 | platform/x86/intel/pmc: Fix pmc_core_iounmap to call iounmap for valid addresses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50107</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases

Linear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient
execution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address
Space Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.

Until kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,
or when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,
otherwise keep LAM disabled.

There are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently
nobody is affected by this issue.

firewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent device

In a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 ("firewire: core: use helper functions for self
ID sequence"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored with
some helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions are
guaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application
includes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected
to parent device.

This bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or
more ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path
to update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection
fault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.

This commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50114 | KVM: arm64: Unregister redistributor for failed vCPU creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50114</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Upon closer inspection, it appears that we do not properly tear down the
MMIO registration for a vCPU that fails creation late in the game, e.g.
a vCPU w/ the same ID already exists in the VM.

It is important to consider the context of commit that introduced this bug
by moving the unregistration out of __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). That
change correctly sought to avoid an srcu v. config_lock inversion by
breaking up the vCPU teardown into two parts, one guarded by the
config_lock.

Fix the use-after-free while avoiding lock inversion by adding a
special-cased unregistration to __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). This is safe
because failed vCPUs are torn down outside of the config_lock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50115 | KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50116 | nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50116</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine
was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer
is written normally by log writing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50117 | drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50117</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[CAUSE]
To support mounting different subvolume with different RO/RW flags for
the new mount APIs, btrfs introduced two workaround to support this feature:

- Skip mount option/feature checks if we are mounting a different
  subvolume

- Reconfigure the fs to RW if the initial mount is RO

Combining these two, we can have the following sequence:

- Mount the fs ro,rescue=all,clear_cache,space_cache=v1
  rescue=all will mark the fs as hard read-only, so no v2 cache clearing
  will happen.

- Mount a subvolume rw of the same fs.
  We go into btrfs_get_tree_subvol(), but fc_mount() returns EBUSY
  because our new fc is RW, different from the original fs.

  Now we enter btrfs_reconfigure_for_mount(), which switches the RO flag
  first so that we can grab the existing fs_info.
  Then we reconfigure the fs to RW.

- During reconfiguration, option/features check is skipped
  This means we will restart the v2 cache clearing, and convert back to
  v1 cache.
  This will trigger fs writes, and since the original fs has "rescue=all"
  option, it skips the csum tree read.

  And eventually causing NULL pointer dereference in super block
  writeback.

[FIX]
For reconfiguration caused by different subvolume RO/RW flags, ensure we
always run btrfs_check_options() to ensure we have proper hard RO
requirements met.

In fact the function btrfs_check_options() doesn't really do many
complex checks, but hard RO requirement and some feature dependency
checks, thus there is no special reason not to do the check for mount
reconfiguration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50119 | cifs: fix warning when destroy &amp;#x27;cifs_io_request_pool&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50119</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In 'taprio_change()', 'admin' pointer may become dangling due to sched
switch / removal caused by 'advance_sched()', and critical section
protected by 'q-&gt;current_entry_lock' is too small to prevent from such
a scenario (which causes use-after-free detected by KASAN). Fix this
by prefer 'rcu_replace_pointer()' over 'rcu_assign_pointer()' to update
'admin' immediately before an attempt to schedule freeing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50128 | net: wwan: fix global oob in wwan_rtnl_policy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Adjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over

we allocate exactly pcdev-&gt;nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix
ensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50130 | netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50130</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Eric says:
 It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook()
 after exit()/close() time.
 Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been
 dismantled/freed already.
 bpf_nf_link_attach() does :
 link-&gt;net = net;
 But I do not see a reference being taken on net.

Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg.
Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so I
do not know if this resolves this splat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50131 | tracing: Consider the NULL character when validating the event length</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50131</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

strlen() returns a string length excluding the null byte. If the string

tracing/probes: Fix MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit handling

When creating a trace_probe we would set nr_args prior to truncating the
arguments to MAX_TRACE_ARGS. However, we would only initialize arguments
up to the limit.

This caused invalid memory access when attempting to set up probes with
more than 128 fetchargs.

bpf: Use raw_spinlock_t in ringbuf

The function __bpf_ringbuf_reserve is invoked from a tracepoint, which
disables preemption. Using spinlock_t in this context can lead to a
"sleep in atomic" warning in the RT variant. This issue is illustrated
in the example below:

thermal: intel: int340x: processor: Fix warning during module unload

The processor_thermal driver uses pcim_device_enable() to enable a PCI
device, which means the device will be automatically disabled on driver
detach.  Thus there is no need to call pci_disable_device() again on it.

With recent PCI device resource management improvements, e.g. commit
f748a07a0b64 ("PCI: Remove legacy pcim_release()"), this problem is
exposed and triggers the warining below.

sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.

Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from
netpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll
invokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It is
dedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used
while sending the packet.

In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,
leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.

Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50095 | RDMA/mad: Improve handling of timed out WRs of mad agent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.

To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of
an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned to the user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50097 | net: fec: don&amp;#x27;t save PTP state if PTP is unsupported</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

unconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add a

supported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51362 | The LSC Smart Connect Indoor IP Camera V7.6.32 is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue where live camera footage can be accessed th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51362</link><description>The LSC Smart Connect Indoor IP Camera V7.6.32 is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue where live camera footage can be accessed through the RTSP protocol on port 8554 without requiring authentication.

bpf: support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking

Use instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed
register spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through
read-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it
*and* potentially adjusting offset.

To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into
instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame
number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction
history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's
checked most frequently during backtracking.

This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of
precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known
deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of
verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.

There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files
according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).

File                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)
--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------
test_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)

Note, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to
minimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between
bpf and bpf-next trees.

Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of
instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of
relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we
already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we
added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but
also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we
don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is
present.

Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one
that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.
