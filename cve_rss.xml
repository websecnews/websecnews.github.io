An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:23:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6563 | Buffer Overflow Arbitrary Write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6563</link><description>Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') vulnerability in Renesas arm-trusted-firmware allows Local Execution of Code. This vulnerability is associated with program files  https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar_gen3_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/i... https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar_gen3_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/io_rcar.C .




In line 313 "addr_loaded_cnt" is checked not to be "CHECK_IMAGE_AREA_CNT" (5) or larger, this check does not halt the function. Immediately after (line 317) there will be an overflow in the buffer and the value of "dst" will be written to the area immediately after the buffer, which is "addr_loaded_cnt". This will allow an attacker to freely control the value of "addr_loaded_cnt" and thus control the destination of the write immediately after (line 318). The write in line 318 will then be fully controlled by said attacker, with whichever address and whichever value ("len") they desire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:23:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39677 | NHibernate SQL injection vulnerability in discriminator mappings, static fields referenced in HQL, and some utilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39677</link><description>NHibernate is an object-relational mapper for the .NET framework. A SQL injection vulnerability exists in some types implementing ILiteralType.ObjectToSQLString. Callers of these methods are exposed to the vulnerability, which includes mappings using inheritance with discriminator values; HQL queries referencing a static field of the application; users of the SqlInsertBuilder and SqlUpdateBuilder utilities, calling their AddColumn overload taking a literal value; and any direct use of the ObjectToSQLString methods for building SQL queries on the user side. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.4.9 and 5.5.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39308 | RailsAdmin Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in the list view</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39308</link><description>RailsAdmin is a Rails engine that provides an interface for managing data.

drm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting race


filp-&gt;pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before this
patch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct
pid after storing a pointer to it in filp-&gt;pid and dropping the
dev-&gt;filelist_mutex, making the following race possible:

process A               process B
=========               =========
                        begin drm_file_update_pid
                        mutex_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp-&gt;pid, , 1)
                        mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
begin drm_file_update_pid
mutex_lock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
rcu_replace_pointer(filp-&gt;pid, , 1)
mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;dev-&gt;filelist_mutex)
get_pid()
synchronize_rcu()
put_pid()   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***
                        get_pid()   *** UAF ***
                        synchronize_rcu()
                        put_pid()

As far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
because it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not
explicitly calling into the scheduler.

This race leads to use-after-free of a "struct pid".
It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass
through a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between
mutex_unlock() and get_pid().

Fix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid
is stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.

This fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I think
that optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case we
would usually have bailed out on the lockless check above.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 09:29:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5616 | CSRF Vulnerability in mudler/LocalAI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5616</link><description>A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in mudler/LocalAI versions up to and including 2.15.0, which allows attackers to trick victims into deleting installed models. By crafting a malicious HTML page, an attacker can cause the deletion of a model, such as 'gpt-4-vision-preview', without the victim's consent. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protection mechanisms on the model deletion functionality.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 08:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40594 | The OpenAI ChatGPT app before 2024-07-05 for macOS opts out of the sandbox, and stores conversations in cleartext in a location accessible t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40594</link><description>The OpenAI ChatGPT app before 2024-07-05 for macOS opts out of the sandbox, and stores conversations in cleartext in a location accessible to other apps.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 04:41:04 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
