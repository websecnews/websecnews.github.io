In affected versions an attacker is capable of updating or deleting groups from an organization given a few conditions: 1. The attacker has a user account in the server. 2. The attacker's account has admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization. 3. The attacker knows the target organization's UUID and the target group's UUID. Note that this vulnerability is related to group functionality and as such is only applicable for servers who have enabled the `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED` setting, which is disabled by default. This attack can lead to different situations: 1. Denial of service, the attacker can limit users from accessing the organization's data by removing their membership from the group. 2. Privilege escalation, if the attacker is part of the victim organization, they can escalate their own privileges by joining a group they wouldn't normally have access to. For attackers that aren't part of the organization, this shouldn't lead to any possible plain-text data exfiltration as all the data is encrypted client side. This vulnerability is patched in Vaultwarden `1.32.7`, and users are recommended to update as soon as possible. If it's not possible to update to `1.32.7`,  some possible workarounds are: 1. Disabling `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED`, which would disable groups functionality on the server. 2. Disabling `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`, which would not allow an attacker to create new accounts on the server.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 20:29:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56330 | Session VNC may be accessed by other sessions on the same host in stardust</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56330</link><description>Stardust is a platform for streaming isolated desktop containers.

It replaces the published authentication and profile scaffolding provided by Laravel Jetstream, with scaffolding that has support for Laravel Socialite. When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if -&gt;stateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks. Socialstream v6.2 introduces a new custom route that requires a user to "Confirm" or "Deny" a request to link a social account. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 20:13:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56331 | Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Improper URL Handling in uptime-kuma&amp;#x27;s `Real-Browser` monitor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56331</link><description>Uptime Kuma is an open source, self-hosted monitoring tool. An **Improper URL Handling Vulnerability** allows an attacker to access sensitive local files on the server by exploiting the `file:///` protocol. This vulnerability is triggered via the **"real-browser"** request type, which takes a screenshot of the URL provided by the attacker. By supplying local file paths, such as `file:///etc/passwd`, an attacker can read sensitive data from the server. This vulnerability arises because the system does not properly validate or sanitize the user input for the URL field. Specifically: 1. The URL input (`&lt;input class="form-control" id="url" pattern="https?://.+" required="" type="url" /&gt;`) allows users to input arbitrary file paths, including those using the `file:///` protocol, without server-side validation. 2. The server then uses the user-provided URL to make a request, passing it to a browser instance that performs the "real-browser" request, which takes a screenshot of the content at the given URL. If a local file path is entered (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), the browser fetches and captures the file’s content. Since the user input is not validated, an attacker can manipulate the URL to request local files (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), and the system will capture a screenshot of the file's content, potentially exposing sensitive data. Any **authenticated user** who can submit a URL in "real-browser" mode is at risk of exposing sensitive data through screenshots of these files. This issue has been addressed in version 1.23.16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 19:56:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56333 | Remote code execution in onyxia-api</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56333</link><description>Onyxia is a web app that aims at being the glue between multiple open source backend technologies to provide a state of art working environment for data scientists.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.

The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.

Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation 
parameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:
- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)
- running on Java 17: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false)
- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)

Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:40:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55471 | Oqtane Framework is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Oqtane.Controllers.UserController.

This vulnerability only impacts Discourse instances configured to use `FileStore::LocalStore` which means uploads and backups are stored locally on disk. If an attacker knows the name of the Discourse backup file, the attacker can trick nginx into sending the Discourse backup file with a well crafted request. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can either 1. Download all local backups on to another storage device, disable the `enable_backups` site setting and delete all backups until the site has been upgraded to pull in the fix. Or  2. Change the `backup_location` site setting to `s3` so that backups are stored and downloaded directly from S3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 19:24:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56159 | Server source code is exposed to the public if sourcemaps are enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56159</link><description>Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. A bug in the build process allows any unauthenticated user to read parts of the server source code. During build, along with client assets such as css and font files, the sourcemap files **for the server code** are moved to a publicly-accessible folder. Any outside party can read them with an unauthorized HTTP GET request to the same server hosting the rest of the website. While some server files are hashed, making their access obscure, the files corresponding to the file system router (those in `src/pages`) are predictably named. For example. the sourcemap file for `src/pages/index.astro` gets named `dist/client/pages/index.astro.mjs.map`. This vulnerability is the root cause of issue #12703, which links to a simple stackblitz project demonstrating the vulnerability. Upon build, notice the contents of the `dist/client` (referred to as `config.build.client` in astro code) folder. All astro servers make the folder in question accessible to the public internet without any authentication. It contains `.map` files corresponding to the code that runs on the server. All **server-output** projects on Astro 5 versions **v5.0.3** through **v5.0.7**, that have **sourcemaps enabled**, either directly or through an add-on such as `sentry`, are affected. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**. Additionally, all **static-output** projects built using Astro 4 versions **4.16.17 or older**, or Astro 5 versions **5.0.8 or older**, that have **sourcemaps enabled** are also affected. The fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9**, and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. The immediate impact is limited to source code. Any secrets or environment variables are not exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code. There is no immediate loss of integrity within the the vulnerable server. However, it is possible to subsequently discover another vulnerability via the revealed source code . There is no immediate impact to availability of the vulnerable server. However, the presence of an unsafe regular expression, for example, can quickly be exploited to subsequently compromise the availability. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**, and the fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9** and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. Users are advised to update immediately if they are using sourcemaps or an integration that enables sourcemaps.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 19:16:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56200 | Uncontrolled Recursion and Asymmetric Resource Consumption in Altair media/file proxy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56200</link><description>Altair is a fork of Misskey v12. Affected versions lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy for compressing and resizing remote files could allow attacks that could affect availability, such as by abnormally increasing the CPU usage of the server on which this software is running or placing a heavy load on the network it is using. This issue has been fixed in v12.24Q4.1. Users are advised to upgrade.

Algorithm confusion occurs when a system improperly verifies the type of signature used, allowing attackers to exploit the lack of distinction between signing methods.  If the system doesn't differentiate between an HMAC signed token and an RS/EC/PS signed token during verification, it becomes vulnerable to this kind of attack. For instance, an attacker could craft a token with the alg field set to "HS256" while the server expects an asymmetric algorithm like "RS256". The server might mistakenly use the wrong verification method, such as using a public key as the HMAC secret, leading to unauthorised access. For RSA, the key can be computed from a few signatures. For Elliptic Curve (EC), two potential keys can be recovered from one signature. This can be used to bypass the signature mechanism if an application relies on asymmetrically signed tokens. This issue has been addressed in version 2.3.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:39:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55196 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials in the Mail Server Configuration in GoPhish v0.12.1 allows an attacker to access cleartext passwords fo...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55196</link><description>Insufficiently Protected Credentials in the Mail Server Configuration in GoPhish v0.12.1 allows an attacker to access cleartext passwords for the configured IMAP and SMTP servers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:39:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-6923 | HP Linux Imaging and Printing Software - Potential Memory Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6923</link><description>The HP Linux Imaging and Printing (HPLIP) software may potentially be affected by memory buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:39:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12793 | PbootCMS IndexController.php path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12793</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in PbootCMS up to 5.2.3.

      before program execution.





Malicious logback configuration files can allow the attacker to execute 
arbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator extension.



A successful attack requires the user to have write access to a 
configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious 
environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both 
cases, the attack requires existing privilege.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 15:17:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12786 | X1a0He Adobe Downloader XPC Service com.x1a0he.macOS.Adobe-Downloader.helper shouldAcceptNewConnection privileges management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12786</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in X1a0He Adobe Downloader up to 1.3.1 on macOS.

guests, when the (virtual) VGA is in "standard" mode.  Locking involved
there has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the
return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a
problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of
which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't
relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already
being held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a
deadlock.

This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but
was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light
of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking
discipline work.

In staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered
to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the
locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note
that even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired
for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:29:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45819 | libxl leaks data to PVH guests via ACPI tables</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45819</link><description>PVH guests have their ACPI tables constructed by the toolstack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the NumberOfBytes argument to ExAllocatePoolWithTag, and the Length argument for RtlCopyMemory, both independently dereference their value from the user supplied input buffer inside the EpdlpSetUsbAction function, known as a double-fetch. If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemory call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. A malicious attacker will need admin privileges to exploit the issue.
