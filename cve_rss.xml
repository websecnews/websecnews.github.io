Version 24.11.0, and only version 24.11.0, is vulnerable to a scenario where a specific error message generated by the Sentry platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions: An app installation made use of a Search UI component with the `async` flag set to true (default: true); auser types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results; and that third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret. Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. 

Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. For Sentry SaaS users, only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. No abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred.

As of time of publication, a fix is available for users of Sentry self-hosted in pull request 81038. Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so Sentry self-hosted users will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. Sentry self-hosted users may review `select_requester.py` for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type. Sentry self-hosted users may not install version 24.11.0 and instead wait for the next release. Self-hosted instance that are already running the affected version may consider downgrading to to 24.10.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:19:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47863 | An issue was discovered in Centreon Web through 24.10.

LoongArch: KVM: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context

Like commit 2c0d278f3293f ("KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard
interrupt context") and commit 9090825fa9974 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Let the
timer expire in hardirq context on RT"), On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels
unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft interrupt expiry mode by default.
Then the timers are canceled from an preempt-notifier which is invoked
with disabled preemption which is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT.

The timer callback is short so in could be invoked in hard-IRQ context.
So let the timer expire on hard-IRQ context even on -RT.

This fix a "scheduling while atomic" bug for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels:

afs: Fix lock recursion

afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it
is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the -&gt;notify_lock, but it tries to
take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but
if the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must
be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through
rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the
-&gt;notify_lock again.

This case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops
looks something like:

As the introduction of the support for vsock and unix sockets in sockmap,
tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx cannot presume the socket passed in must be IS_ICSK.
vsock and af_unix sockets have vsock_sock and unix_sock instead of
inet_connection_sock. For these sockets, tls_get_ctx may return an invalid

virtio_pci: Fix admin vq cleanup by using correct info pointer

vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs() clean up admin vq
resources by virtio_pci_vq_info pointer. The info pointer of admin
vq is stored in vp_dev-&gt;admin_vq.info instead of vp_dev-&gt;vqs[].
Using the info pointer from vp_dev-&gt;vqs[] for admin vq causes a

In vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs(), get the info pointer
from vp_dev-&gt;admin_vq.info for admin vq to clean up the resources.
Also make info ptr as argument of vp_del_vq() to be symmetric with
vp_setup_vq().

nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning

We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the
controller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will
wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that
action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the

While running ISER over SIW, the initiator machine encounters a warning

smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while
reconnecting to a server.  [0]

The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers
in non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but
it was always while the pod was dying.

The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.

CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that
the socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is
always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.

The repro steps are roughly:

  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns
  2. drop packets from the netns
  3. destroy the netns
  4. unmount CIFS

We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see
the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.

When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime
without holding refcnt due to async timers.

Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit
9744d2bf1976 ("smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().").

Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to
clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a
freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().

Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because
the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same
address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45194 | In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45194</link><description>In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.

First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion.

Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7. No known workarounds for the vulnerability are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:37:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45663 | IBM Db2 denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45663</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) 11.1 and 11.5 is vulnerable to a denial of service as the server may crash under certain conditions with a specially crafted query.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
