A vulnerability has been discovered in Laravel Pulse prior to version 1.3.1 that could allow remote code execution through the public `remember()` method in the `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries` trait. This method is accessible via Livewire components and can be exploited to call arbitrary callables within the application. An authenticated user with access to Laravel Pulse dashboard can execute arbitrary code by calling any function or static method in which the callable is a function or static method and the callable has no parameters or no strict parameter types. The vulnerable to component is `remember(callable $query, string $key = '')` method in `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries`, and the vulnerability affects all Pulse card components that use this trait. Version 1.3.1 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55887 | Ucum-java has an XXE vulnerability in XML parsing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55887</link><description>Ucum-java is a FHIR Java library providing UCUM Services. In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:21:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54139 | Combodo iTop vulnerable to XSS leading to CSRF breach on _table_id parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54139</link><description>Combodo iTop is an open source and web-based IT service management platform.

A vulnerability exists in the OpenTelemetry Logs source in Data Prepper starting inversion 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.10.2 where some custom authentication plugins will not perform authentication. This allows unauthorized users to ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data under certain conditions. This vulnerability does not affect the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper. Pipelines which use the `http_basic` authentication provider continue to require authentication. The vulnerability exists only for custom implementations of Data Prepper’s `GrpcAuthenticationProvider` authentication plugin which implement the `getHttpAuthenticationService()` method instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`. Data Prepper 2.10.2 contains a fix for this issue. For those unable to upgrade, one may use the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper and/or add an authentication proxy in front of one's Data Prepper instances running the OpenTelemetry Logs source.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 19:36:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55877 | XWiki allows remote code execution from account through macro descriptions and XWiki.XWikiSyntaxMacrosList</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55877</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

In the ESPTouchV2 protocol, while there is an option to use a custom AES key, there is no option to set the IV (Initialization Vector) prior to versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. The IV is set to zero and remains constant throughout the product's lifetime. In AES/CBC mode, if the IV is not properly initialized, the encrypted output becomes deterministic, leading to potential data leakage. To address the aforementioned issues, the application generates a random IV when activating the AES key starting in versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. This IV is then transmitted along with the provision data to the provision device. The provision device has also been equipped with a parser for the AES IV. The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of ESPTouch v2 component from ESP-IDF. As it is implemented in the ESP Wi-Fi stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 22:45:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53273 | GHSL-2024-110: Reflected XSS in /register in habitica</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53273</link><description>Habitica is an open-source habit-building program.

An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:22:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47607 | GHSL-2024-116: Stack-buffer overflow in gst_opus_dec_parse_header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47607</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components.  stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the gst_opus_dec_parse_header function within `gstopusdec.c'.

An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the format_channel_mask function in gst-discoverer.c. The vulnerability affects the local array position, which is defined with a fixed size of 64 elements. However, the function gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels may return a guint channels value greater than 64. This causes the for loop to attempt access beyond the bounds of the position array, resulting in an OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used. This vulnerability can result in reading unintended bytes from the stack. Additionally, the dereference of value-&gt;value_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37377 | A heap-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a d...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37377</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37401 | An out-of-bounds read in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial o...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37401</link><description>An out-of-bounds read in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42448 | From the VSPC management agent machine, under condition that the management agent is authorized on the server, it is possible to perform Rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42448</link><description>From the VSPC management agent machine, under condition that the management agent is authorized on the server, it is possible to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the VSPC server machine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45337 | Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45337</link><description>Applications and libraries which misuse the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback callback may be susceptible to an authorization bypass.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47537 | GHSL-2024-094: GStreamer has an OOB-write in isomp4/qtdemux.c</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47537</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream-&gt;samples to accommodate stream-&gt;n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47538 | GHSL-2024-115: GStreamer has a stack-buffer overflow in vorbis_handle_identification_packet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47538</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd-&gt;vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure.

An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was identified in the convert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c. The vulnerability arises due to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the storage array and the loop condition i * 2 &lt; ccpair_size. Specifically, when ccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This bug allows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated bounds of the storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:08:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47540 | GHSL-2024-197: GStreamer uses uninitialized stack memory in Matroska/WebM demuxer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47540</link><description>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size &lt; 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap_full or mem-&gt;allocator-&gt;mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution.

An OOB-write vulnerability has been identified in the gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes function of the gstssaparse.c file. This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}). The issue arises when a closing curly bracket "}" appears before an opening curly bracket "{" in the input string. In this case, memmove() incorrectly duplicates a substring. With each successive loop iteration, the size passed to memmove() becomes progressively larger (strlen(end+1)), leading to a write beyond the allocated memory bounds.

An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in qtdemux_parse_container function within qtdemux.c. In the parent function qtdemux_parse_node, the value of length is not well checked. So, if length is big enough, it causes the pointer end to point beyond the boundaries of buffer. Subsequently, in the qtdemux_parse_container function, the while loop can trigger an OOB-read, accessing memory beyond the bounds of buf.
