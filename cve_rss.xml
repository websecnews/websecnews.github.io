mm: swap: fix potential buffer overflow in setup_clusters()

In setup_swap_map(), we only ensure badpages are in range (0, last_page]. 
As maxpages might be &lt; last_page, setup_clusters() will encounter a buffer
overflow when a badpage is &gt;= maxpages.

Only call inc_cluster_info_page() for badpage which is &lt; maxpages to fix
the issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 15:30:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39729 | crypto: ccp - Fix dereferencing uninitialized error pointer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39729</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: vm_unmap_ram() may be called from an invalid context

When testing F2FS with xfstests using UFS backed virtual disks the
kernel complains sometimes that f2fs_release_decomp_mem() calls
vm_unmap_ram() from an invalid context. Example trace from
f2fs/007 test:

wifi: ath11k: fix sleeping-in-atomic in ath11k_mac_op_set_bitrate_mask()

ath11k_mac_disable_peer_fixed_rate() is passed as the iterator to
ieee80211_iterate_stations_atomic(). Note in this case the iterator is
required to be atomic, however ath11k_mac_disable_peer_fixed_rate() does
not follow it as it might sleep. Consequently below warning is seen:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at wmi.c:304

Revert "fs/ntfs3: Replace inode_trylock with inode_lock"

This reverts commit 69505fe98f198ee813898cbcaf6770949636430b.

Initially, conditional lock acquisition was removed to fix an xfstest bug
that was observed during internal testing. The deadlock reported by syzbot
is resolved by reintroducing conditional acquisition. The xfstest bug no
longer occurs on kernel version 6.16-rc1 during internal testing. I
assume that changes in other modules may have contributed to this.</description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 15:30:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10068 | itsourcecode Online Discussion Forum add_views.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10068</link><description>A flaw has been found in itsourcecode Online Discussion Forum 1.0.

The file.download() method does not properly sanitize user-supplied filenames or validate the final download path. A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../../../windows/system32/file.txt) or illegal characters that, when processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used.  The vulnerability is particularly critical for users on Windows systems, but all operating systems are affected. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.1.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 18:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0032 | Improper cleanup in AMD CPU microcode patch loading could allow

In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token. Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace, but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired.

In versions 3.26.6 and below, a Github workflow used unsanitized pull request metadata in a privileged context, allowing an attacker to craft malicious input and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Actions runner. The workflow runs with broad permissions and access to repository secrets. It is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the runner, push or modify code in the repository, access secrets, and create malicious releases or packages, resulting in a complete compromise of the repository and its associated services. This is fixed in version 3.26.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:47:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58370 | Roo Code: Potential Remote Code Execution via Bash Parameter Expansion and Indirect Reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58370</link><description>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors.

Versions 3.12.2 and lower and 3.13.0-M1 through 3.13.0-M6 is vulnerable to denial of service attacks though TLS sessions using fs2-io on the JVM using the fs2.io.net.tls package. When establishing a TLS session, if one side of the connection shuts down `write` while the peer side is awaiting more data to progress the TLS handshake, the peer side will spin loop on the socket read, fully utilizing a CPU. The CPU is consumed until the overall connection is closed, potentially shutting down a fs2-io powered server. This issue is fixed in versions 3.12.1 and 3.13.0-M7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 22:02:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58367 | DeepDiff is vulnerable to DoS and Remote Code Execution via Delta class pollution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58367</link><description>DeepDiff is a project focused on Deep Difference and search of any Python data. Versions 5.0.0 through 8.6.0 are vulnerable to class pollution via the Delta class constructor, and when combined with a gadget available in DeltaDiff, it can lead to Denial of Service and Remote Code Execution (via insecure Pickle deserialization) exploitation. The gadget available in DeepDiff allows `deepdiff.serialization.SAFE_TO_IMPORT` to be modified to allow dangerous classes such as posix.system, and then perform insecure Pickle deserialization via the Delta class. This potentially allows any Python code to be executed, given that the input to Delta is user-controlled. Depending on the application where DeepDiff is used, this can also lead to other vulnerabilities.

s390/mm: Do not map lowcore with identity mapping

Since the identity mapping is pinned to address zero the lowcore is always
also mapped to address zero, this happens regardless of the relocate_lowcore
command line option. If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped
twice, instead of only once.

This means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an
exception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts).
To fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the
identity mapping.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38734 | net/smc: fix UAF on smcsk after smc_listen_out()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38734</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The direct cause of this issue is that after smc_listen_out_connected(),
newclcsock-&gt;sk may be NULL since it will releases the smcsk. Therefore,
if the application closes the socket immediately after accept,
newclcsock-&gt;sk can be NULL. A possible execution order could be as
follows:

smc_listen_work                                 | userspace
-----------------------------------------------------------------
lock_sock(sk)                                   |
smc_listen_out_connected()                      |
| \- smc_listen_out                             |

     | |- sk-&gt;sk_data_ready()                   |
                                                | fd = accept();
                                                | close(fd);
                                                |  \- socket-&gt;sk = NULL;
/* newclcsock-&gt;sk is NULL now */
SMC_STAT_SERV_SUCC_INC(sock_net(newclcsock-&gt;sk))

Since smc_listen_out_connected() will not fail, simply swapping the order
of the code can easily fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38735 | gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38735</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown

A crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invoked
after shutdown() is called.

shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operations
without performing expensive deallocations. It is discouraged to
unregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visible
to userspace and kernel helpers.

In gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If an
ethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereference
freed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful
shutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot
syscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger
this path.

Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().
This marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler
will skip dispatching operations to the driver.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38736 | net: usb: asix_devices: Fix PHY address mask in MDIO bus initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38736</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_path

ppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:

1. The ppp-&gt;channels list can change between list_empty() and
   list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel
   is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may
   access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.

2. pch-&gt;chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,
   pch-&gt;chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp-&gt;channels.

Fix these by using a lockless RCU approach:
- Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list
  entry.
- Convert list modifications on ppp-&gt;channels to their RCU variants and
  add synchronize_net() after removal.
- Check for a NULL pch-&gt;chan before dereferencing it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39674 | scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39674</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference

ESI/MSI is a performance optimization feature that provides dedicated
interrupts per MCQ hardware queue. This is optional feature and UFS MCQ
should work with and without ESI feature.

Commit e46a28cea29a ("scsi: ufs: qcom: Remove the MSI descriptor abuse")
brings a regression in ESI (Enhanced System Interrupt) configuration that
causes a null pointer dereference when Platform MSI allocation fails.

The issue occurs in when platform_device_msi_init_and_alloc_irqs() in
ufs_qcom_config_esi() fails (returns -EINVAL) but the current code uses
__free() macro for automatic cleanup free MSI resources that were never
successfully allocated.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual

Fix by restructuring the ESI configuration to try MSI allocation first,
before any other resource allocation and instead use explicit cleanup
instead of __free() macro to avoid cleanup of unallocated resources.

net/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal

This issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and
fq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new
limit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the
subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:

   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will
   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,
   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of
   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling
   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a
   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the
   new limit in their change handlers.

   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to
   support a limit of 0):

   export TARGET=fq
   tc qdisc del dev lo root
   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000
   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null
   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0
   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq
   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo

   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive
   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the
   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers
   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an
   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).

To fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal
has been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.
qdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that
do not directly use the dequeue handler.

The old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to
the subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.
However, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also
potentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the
non gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39678 | platform/x86/amd/hsmp: Ensure sock-&amp;gt;metric_tbl_addr is non-NULL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39678</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on our

tls: fix handling of zero-length records on the rx_list

Each recvmsg() call must process either
 - only contiguous DATA records (any number of them)
 - one non-DATA record

If the next record has different type than what has already been
processed we break out of the main processing loop. If the record
has already been decrypted (which may be the case for TLS 1.3 where
we don't know type until decryption) we queue the pending record
to the rx_list. Next recvmsg() will pick it up from there.

Queuing the skb to rx_list after zero-copy decrypt is not possible,
since in that case we decrypted directly to the user space buffer,
and we don't have an skb to queue (darg.skb points to the ciphertext
skb for access to metadata like length).

Only data records are allowed zero-copy, and we break the processing
loop after each non-data record. So we should never zero-copy and
then find out that the record type has changed. The corner case
we missed is when the initial record comes from rx_list, and it's
zero length.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39683 | tracing: Limit access to parser-&amp;gt;buffer when trace_get_user failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()

syzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel
buffer is allocated to hold `insn-&gt;n` samples (each of which is an
`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn-&gt;n` samples are
copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The
problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return
data to userspace fill in the whole `insn-&gt;n` samples, so that there is
an information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at
the time of writing.

One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have
a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`
handler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if
`insn-&gt;n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn-&gt;n - 1` samples copied
to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.

Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the "vm80xx" driver.  It
never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.

Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure
that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before
handling each instruction.

Thanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix
replaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not
always necessary to clear the whole buffer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39685 | comedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39685</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number

The reproducer passed in an irq number(0x80008000) that was too large,

Added an interrupt number check to prevent users from passing in an irq
number that was too large.

If `it-&gt;options[1]` is 31, then `1 &lt;&lt; it-&gt;options[1]` is still invalid
because it shifts a 1-bit into the sign bit (which is UB in C).
Possible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the
`it-&gt;options[1]` value to 30 or lower, or using `1U &lt;&lt; it-&gt;options[1]`.

The old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the
`options[1]` value were invalid.  And it would still configure the
device without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an
error.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39686 | comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn-&amp;gt;n samples</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39686</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn-&gt;n samples

The `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for
`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for
`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default
handler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler
for `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed
`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`
instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,
indicated by the `insn-&gt;n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently
only handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will
copy `insn-&gt;n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASAN
kernel-infoleak errors when `insn-&gt;n` was greater than 1, but that is
being fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)

Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn-&gt;n` samples, or return
an error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and
`INSN_WRITE` handlers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39687 | iio: light: as73211: Ensure buffer holes are zeroed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39687</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Also allocate and copy hash for reading of filter files

Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace just adds
the pointer to the global tracer hash to its iterator. Unlike the writer
that allocates a copy of the hash, the reader keeps the pointer to the
filter hashes. This is problematic because this pointer is static across
function calls that release the locks that can update the global tracer
hashes. This can cause UAF and similar bugs.

Allocate and copy the hash for reading the filter files like it is done
for the writers. This not only fixes UAF bugs, but also makes the code a
bit simpler as it doesn't have to differentiate when to free the
iterator's hash between writers and readers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39690 | iio: accel: sca3300: fix uninitialized iio scan data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39690</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In the mpage_read_folio() function, the stack variable 'map_bh' is
passed to ntfs_get_block_vbo(). Once unlock_buffer() unlocks and
wait_on_buffer() returns to continue processing, the stack variable
is likely to be reclaimed. Consequently, during the end_buffer_read_sync()
process, calling put_bh() may result in stack overrun.

If the bh is not allocated on the stack, it belongs to a folio.  Freeing
a buffer head which belongs to a folio is done by drop_buffers() which
will fail to free buffers which are still locked.  So it is safe to call
put_bh() before __end_buffer_read_notouch().</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39692 | smb: server: split ksmbd_rdma_stop_listening() out of ksmbd_rdma_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39692</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present check

Tracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exits
if the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check is
performed after physical to virtual address translation.

If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address zero, the
resulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won't
work. Subsequently this may result in incorrect accesses to the first
page of the identity mapping.

Fix this by introducing a function that handles the NULL case before
address translation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39695 | RDMA/rxe: Flush delayed SKBs while releasing RXE resources</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39695</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Flush delayed SKBs while releasing RXE resources

When skb packets are sent out, these skb packets still depends on
the rxe resources, for example, QP, sk, when these packets are
destroyed.

If these rxe resources are released when the skb packets are destroyed,
the call traces will appear.

To avoid skb packets hang too long time in some network devices,
a timestamp is added when these skb packets are created. If these
skb packets hang too long time in network devices, these network
devices can free these skb packets to release rxe resources.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39696 | ALSA: hda: tas2781: Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39696</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write

After nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is
still attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to
nfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the
page group.
The reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't
necessarily have a lock on the page group head.

So in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in
nfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the
request in nfs_inode_remove_request().</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39698 | io_uring/futex: ensure io_futex_wait() cleans up properly on failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39698</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring whether the field is valid or not.

This issue was found by syzkaller.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a
corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it
attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and
skb_push() panics.

The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a
sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific
corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG).

Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to
contain both ethernet and hsr headers.

Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push()
in br_dev_queue_push_xmit().

In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily
see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

drm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability

[Why]
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver's
(DC module) cleanup function dc_destruct().
When display control context (dc-&gt;ctx) construction fails
(due to memory allocation failure), this pointer remains NULL.
During subsequent error handling when dc_destruct() is called,
there's no NULL check before dereferencing the perf_trace member
(dc-&gt;ctx-&gt;perf_trace), causing a kernel null pointer dereference crash.

[How]
Check if dc-&gt;ctx is non-NULL before dereferencing.

media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

Both the ACE and CSI driver are missing a mei_cldev_disable() call in
their remove() function.

This causes the mei_cl client to stay part of the mei_device-&gt;file_list
list even though its memory is freed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() calling
kfree(cldev-&gt;cl).

This leads to a use-after-free when mei_vsc_remove() runs mei_stop()
which first removes all mei bus devices calling mei_ace_remove() and
mei_csi_remove() followed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() and then calls
mei_cl_all_disconnect() which walks over mei_device-&gt;file_list dereferecing
the just freed cldev-&gt;cl.

And mei_vsc_remove() it self is run at shutdown because of the
platform_device_unregister(tp-&gt;pdev) in vsc_tp_shutdown()

When building a kernel with KASAN this leads to the following KASAN report:

media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()

In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on
rain-&gt;buf_len is performed before acquiring rain-&gt;buf_lock. This
creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as
rain-&gt;buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work
handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.

Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len
before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both
interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len
beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.

Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full
check. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification
are performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding
spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the
lock.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39714 | media: usbtv: Lock resolution while streaming</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39714</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

open_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE

As described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series "fs: allow

allow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed
without the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason,
mount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.

However, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 ("fs: allow changing
idmappings") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling
open_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.

can_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached
mountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns()
check), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have
their be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues

crypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown

Repeated loading and unloading of a device specific QAT driver, for
example qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a
use-after-free scenario. This occurs when a power management (PM)
interrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,
qat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains
loaded.

Since the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all
devices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the
device-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this
routine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed
memory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:

To prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to

workqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness

this page.

This is similar to when running OPTEE, where OPTEE will reserve page 0.

page 0 is reserved elsewhere, either by other management cores in SoC or

netfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling

If all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest
collector doesn't update the stream-&gt;transferred value and it retains its
initial LONG_MAX value.  Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we
take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set
in wreq-&gt;transferred - which is then returned from -&gt;write_iter().

LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be
quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream-&gt;transferred -
but this only works if we've set any of them.

Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in
stream-&gt;transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the
values.  stream-&gt;transferred can then be initialised to zero.

This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with
cache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up
all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC.
This causes -&gt;write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning
wreq-&gt;transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought
the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would
then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops
when it overran.  The kernel log showed:

    CIFS: VFS: Send error in write = -28

serial: 8250: fix panic due to PSLVERR

When the PSLVERR_RESP_EN parameter is set to 1, the device generates
an error response if an attempt is made to read an empty RBR (Receive
Buffer Register) while the FIFO is enabled.

In serial8250_do_startup(), calling serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR,
UART_LCR_WLEN8) triggers dw8250_check_lcr(), which invokes
dw8250_force_idle() and serial8250_clear_and_reinit_fifos(). The latter
function enables the FIFO via serial_out(p, UART_FCR, p-&gt;fcr).
Execution proceeds to the serial_port_in(port, UART_RX).
This satisfies the PSLVERR trigger condition.

When another CPU (e.g., using printk()) is accessing the UART (UART
is busy), the current CPU fails the check (value &amp; ~UART_LCR_SPAR) ==
(lcr &amp; ~UART_LCR_SPAR) in dw8250_check_lcr(), causing it to enter
dw8250_force_idle().

Put serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR, UART_LCR_WLEN8) under the port-&gt;lock
to fix this issue.

mm/vmscan: fix hwpoisoned large folio handling in shrink_folio_list

In shrink_folio_list(), the hwpoisoned folio may be large folio, which
can't be handled by unmap_poisoned_folio().  For THP, try_to_unmap_one()
must be passed with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD to split huge PMD first and then
retry.  Without TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger null-ptr deref of
pvmw.pte.  Even we passed TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger a
WARN_ON_ONCE due to the page isn't in swapcache.

Since UCE is rare in real world, and race with reclaimation is more rare,
just skipping the hwpoisoned large folio is enough.  memory_failure() will
handle it if the UCE is triggered again.

This happens when memory reclaim for large folio races with
memory_failure(), and will lead to kernel panic.  The race is as
follows:

cpu0      cpu1
 shrink_folio_list memory_failure
  TestSetPageHWPoison
  unmap_poisoned_folio
  --&gt; trigger BUG_ON due to
  unmap_poisoned_folio couldn't

s390/ism: fix concurrency management in ism_cmd()

The s390x ISM device data sheet clearly states that only one
request-response sequence is allowable per ISM function at any point in
time.  Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not
honor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.

This problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states
that for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state
(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence
connections handled by the respective function break, and for future
connection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a
dysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as
well.

A kernel message like
[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a
is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state
with PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like
[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery
is a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered
because the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.

On a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to
the FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU
trying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that
this can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to
PEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the
failure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command
and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs
as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not
the other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about
providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9709 | NRF52810 Runtime EM Fault Injection APPROTECT Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9709</link><description>On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control and Improper Protection against Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EM-FI) in Nordic Semiconductor nRF52810 allow attacker to perform EM Fault Injection and bypass APPROTECT at runtime, requiring the least amount of modification to the hardware system possible.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:22:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9999 | Improper validation of payload elements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9999</link><description>Some payload elements of the messages sent between two stations in a networking architecture are not properly checked on the receiving station allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized commands in the application.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:51:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9998 | Improper validation of packets sequencing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9998</link><description>The sequence of packets received by a Networking server are not correctly checked.

Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 01:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
