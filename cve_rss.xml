xfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block

This adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry
to make sure don't stray beyond valid memory region. Before patching, the
loop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the
range. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we
can change dup-&gt;length to dup-&gt;length-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the
next traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may
encounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.

In the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold
an unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and
xfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make
sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a
single-byte name before accessing xfs_dir2_data_entry.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41014 | xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data

There is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members
of xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.

We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by
following these steps:
    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records
    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate
       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and
       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter
       xlog_recover_process_data
    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2
    4) Make the end of the xlog_op_header entries only 1 byte away from
       xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_size
    5) xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_num_logops++
    6) Modify xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_crc

Fix:
Add a check to make sure there is sufficient space to access fixed members
of xlog_op_header.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41015 | ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_check_dir_entry()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41015</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_check_dir_entry()

This adds sanity checks for ocfs2_dir_entry to make sure all members of
ocfs2_dir_entry don't stray beyond valid memory region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41016 | ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41016</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

xattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space
requested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before
memcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous
images.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41017 | jfs: don&amp;#x27;t walk off the end of ealist</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41017</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

make sure each ea stays within the ealist.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41018 | fs/ntfs3: Add a check for attr_names and oatbl</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41018</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Validate ff offset

This adds sanity checks for ff offset. There is a check
on rt-&gt;first_free at first, but walking through by ff
without any check. If the second ff is a large offset.
We may encounter an out-of-bound read.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7187 | TOTOLINK A3600R cstecgi.cgi UploadCustomModule buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7187</link><description>A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK A3600R 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102.

tap: add missing verification for short frame

The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length
in the tap_get_user_xdp() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be
sent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the
tap_get_user_xdp()--&gt;skb_set_network_header() may assume the size is more
than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause out-of-bound
access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer with incorrect
or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.

In the alternative path, tap_get_user() already prohibits short frame which
has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted.

This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like
how tap_get_user() does.

tun: add missing verification for short frame

The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length
in the tun_xdp_one() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be sent
downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the
tun_xdp_one--&gt;eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although it
can be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause
out-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer
with incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.

In the alternative path, tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame which
has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted for
IFF_TAP.

This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like
how tun_get_user() does.
