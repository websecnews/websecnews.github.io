By accessing specific URLs, an attacker is presented with a directory-style index listing all available backend services and POS web services, each with an HTML form for submitting test input. These panels are intended for developer use, but are accessible in production environments with no authentication or session validation. This grants any external actor the ability to discover, test, and execute API endpoints that perform critical functions including but not limited to user transaction retrieval, credit adjustments, POS actions, and internal data queries.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:44:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52025 | An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the GetServiceByRestaurantID endpoint of the Aptsys gemscms POS Platform backend thru 2025-05-28.

btrfs: fix use-after-free warning in btrfs_get_or_create_delayed_node()

Previously, btrfs_get_or_create_delayed_node() set the delayed_node's
refcount before acquiring the root-&gt;delayed_nodes lock.
Commit e8513c012de7 ("btrfs: implement ref_tracker for delayed_nodes")
moved refcount_set inside the critical section, which means there is
no longer a memory barrier between setting the refcount and setting
btrfs_inode-&gt;delayed_node.

Without that barrier, the stores to node-&gt;refs and
btrfs_inode-&gt;delayed_node may become visible out of order. Another
thread can then read btrfs_inode-&gt;delayed_node and attempt to
increment a refcount that hasn't been set yet, leading to a
refcounting bug and a use-after-free warning.

The fix is to move refcount_set back to where it was to take
advantage of the implicit memory barrier provided by lock
acquisition.

Because the allocations now happen outside of the lock's critical
section, they can use GFP_NOFS instead of GFP_ATOMIC.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71160 | netfilter: nf_tables: avoid chain re-validation if possible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71160</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Currently nf_tables will traverse the entire table (chain graph), starting
from the entry points (base chains), exploring all possible paths
(chain jumps).  But there are cases where we could avoid revalidation.

Consider:
1  input -&gt; j2 -&gt; j3
2  input -&gt; j2 -&gt; j3
3  input -&gt; j1 -&gt; j2 -&gt; j3

Then the second rule does not need to revalidate j2, and, by extension j3,
because this was already checked during validation of the first rule.
We need to validate it only for rule 3.

This is needed because chain loop detection also ensures we do not exceed
the jump stack: Just because we know that j2 is cycle free, its last jump
might now exceed the allowed stack size.  We also need to update all
reachable chains with the new largest observed call depth.

Care has to be taken to revalidate even if the chain depth won't be an
issue: chain validation also ensures that expressions are not called from
invalid base chains.  For example, the masquerade expression can only be
called from NAT postrouting base chains.

Therefore we also need to keep record of the base chain context (type,
hooknum) and revalidate if the chain becomes reachable from a different
hook location.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71161 | dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71161</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction

There are two problems with the recursive correction:

1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that
has 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block
recursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that
there may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team
actually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this
image just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.

2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable
"fio-&gt;bufs", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if
"verity_hash_for_block" invoked correction recursively, it would
overwrite partially filled fio-&gt;bufs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22978 | wifi: avoid kernel-infoleak from struct iw_point</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22978</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets

When skb_segment_list() is called during packet forwarding, it handles
packets that were aggregated by the GRO engine.

Historically, the segmentation logic in skb_segment_list assumes that
individual segments are split from a parent SKB and may need to carry
their own socket memory accounting. Accordingly, the code transfers
truesize from the parent to the newly created segments.

Prior to commit ed4cccef64c1 ("gro: fix ownership transfer"), this
truesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments
still carry a reference to the original socket.

However, commit ed4cccef64c1 ("gro: fix ownership transfer") changed
this behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly
orphaned (skb-&gt;sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the
stack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained
with the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in
skb_segment_list() was never updated.

As a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's
truesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since
the fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction
results in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.
This causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket
destruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.

The leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking
environment:

unreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):
  comm "ping", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526
  backtrace:
    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800
    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220
    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00

    __sock_create+0x248/0x640
    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0

Since skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST
packets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.

The call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in
commit cf673ed0e057 ("net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count
leak"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB
extensions that may be overwritten during __copy_skb_header().</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22980 | nfsd: provide locking for v4_end_grace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22980</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: provide locking for v4_end_grace

Writing to v4_end_grace can race with server shutdown and result in
memory being accessed after it was freed - reclaim_str_hashtbl in
particularly.

We cannot hold nfsd_mutex across the nfsd4_end_grace() call as that is
held while client_tracking_op-&gt;init() is called and that can wait for
an upcall to nfsdcltrack which can write to v4_end_grace, resulting in a
deadlock.

nfsd4_end_grace() is also called by the landromat work queue and this
doesn't require locking as server shutdown will stop the work and wait
for it before freeing anything that nfsd4_end_grace() might access.

However, we must be sure that writing to v4_end_grace doesn't restart
the work item after shutdown has already waited for it.  For this we
add a new flag protected with nn-&gt;client_lock.  It is set only while it
is safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules
work while the flag is set with the spinlock held.

So this patch adds a nfsd_net field "client_tracking_active" which is
set as described.  Another field "grace_end_forced", is set when
v4_end_grace is written.  After this is set, and providing
client_tracking_active is set, the laundromat is scheduled.
This "grace_end_forced" field bypasses other checks for whether the
grace period has finished.

This resolves a race which can result in use-after-free.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22981 | idpf: detach and close netdevs while handling a reset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22981</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: detach and close netdevs while handling a reset

Protect the reset path from callbacks by setting the netdevs to detached
state and close any netdevs in UP state until the reset handling has
completed. During a reset, the driver will de-allocate resources for the
vport, and there is no guarantee that those will recover, which is why the
existing vport_ctrl_lock does not provide sufficient protection.

idpf_detach_and_close() is called right before reset handling. If the
reset handling succeeds, the netdevs state is recovered via call to
idpf_attach_and_open(). If the reset handling fails the netdevs remain
down. The detach/down calls are protected with RTNL lock to avoid racing
with callbacks. On the recovery side the attach can be done without
holding the RTNL lock as there are no callbacks expected at that point,
due to detach/close always being done first in that flow.

The previous logic restoring the netdevs state based on the
IDPF_VPORT_UP_REQUESTED flag in the init task is not needed anymore, hence
the removal of idpf_set_vport_state(). The IDPF_VPORT_UP_REQUESTED is
still being used to restore the state of the netdevs following the reset,
but has no use outside of the reset handling flow.

idpf_init_hard_reset() is converted to void, since it was used as such and
there is no error handling being done based on its return value.

Before this change, invoking hard and soft resets simultaneously will
cause the driver to lose the vport state:
ip -br a
	UP
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/net/ens801f0/device/reset&amp; \
ethtool -L ens801f0 combined 8
ip -br a
	DOWN
ip link set  up
ip -br a
	DOWN

Also in case of a failure in the reset path, the netdev is left
exposed to external callbacks, while vport resources are not
initialized, leading to a crash on subsequent ifup/down:

Commit 15faa1f67ab4 ("lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag")
fixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.
The ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic
and is susceptible to the same crash.

This issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves
unused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as
it uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.

Fix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22983 | net: do not write to msg_get_inq in callee</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22983</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: do not write to msg_get_inq in callee

NULL pointer dereference fix.

msg_get_inq is an input field from caller to callee. Don't set it in
the callee, as the caller may not clear it on struct reuse.

This is a kernel-internal variant of msghdr only, and the only user
does reinitialize the field. So this is not critical for that reason.
But it is more robust to avoid the write, and slightly simpler code.
And it fixes a bug, see below.

Callers set msg_get_inq to request the input queue length to be
returned in msg_inq. This is equivalent to but independent from the
SO_INQ request to return that same info as a cmsg (tp-&gt;recvmsg_inq).
To reduce branching in the hot path the second also sets the msg_inq.
That is WAI.

This is a fix to commit 4d1442979e4a ("af_unix: don't post cmsg for
SO_INQ unless explicitly asked for"), which fixed the inverse.

Also avoid NULL pointer dereference in unix_stream_read_generic if
state-&gt;msg is NULL and msg-&gt;msg_get_inq is written. A NULL state-&gt;msg
can happen when splicing as of commit 2b514574f7e8 ("net: af_unix:

idpf: Fix RSS LUT NULL pointer crash on early ethtool operations

The RSS LUT is not initialized until the interface comes up, causing
the following NULL pointer crash when ethtool operations like rxhash on/off
are performed before the interface is brought up for the first time.

Move RSS LUT initialization from ndo_open to vport creation to ensure LUT
is always available. This enables RSS configuration via ethtool before
bringing the interface up. Simplify LUT management by maintaining all
changes in the driver's soft copy and programming zeros to the indirection
table when rxhash is disabled. Defer HW programming until the interface
comes up if it is down during rxhash and LUT configuration changes.

Steps to reproduce:
** Load idpf driver; interfaces will be created
	modprobe idpf
** Before bringing the interfaces up, turn rxhash off
	ethtool -K eth2 rxhash off

libceph: make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation

free_choose_arg_map() may dereference a NULL pointer if its caller fails
after a partial allocation.

For example, in decode_choose_args(), if allocation of arg_map-&gt;args
fails, execution jumps to the fail label and free_choose_arg_map() is
called. Since arg_map-&gt;size is updated to a non-zero value before memory
allocation, free_choose_arg_map() will iterate over arg_map-&gt;args and
dereference a NULL pointer.

To prevent this potential NULL pointer dereference and make
free_choose_arg_map() more resilient, add checks for pointers before
iterating.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22992 | libceph: return the handler error from mon_handle_auth_done()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22992</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: Fix RSS LUT NULL ptr issue after soft reset

During soft reset, the RSS LUT is freed and not restored unless the
interface is up. If an ethtool command that accesses the rss lut is
attempted immediately after reset, it will result in NULL ptr
dereference. Also, there is no need to reset the rss lut if the soft reset
does not involve queue count change.

After soft reset, set the RSS LUT to default values based on the updated
queue count only if the reset was a result of a queue count change and
the LUT was not configured by the user. In all other cases, don't touch
the LUT.

Steps to reproduce:

** Bring the interface down (if up)
ifconfig eth1 down

** update the queue count (eg., 27-&gt;20)
ethtool -L eth1 combined 20

** display the RSS LUT
ethtool -x eth1

syzbot is reporting

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sit0 to become free. Usage count = 2

problem. A debug printk() patch found that a refcount is obtained at
xdp_convert_md_to_buff() from bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().

According to commit ec94670fcb3b ("bpf: Support specifying ingress via
xdp_md context in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN"), the refcount obtained by
xdp_convert_md_to_buff() will be released by xdp_convert_buff_to_md().

Therefore, we can consider that the error handling path introduced by
commit 1c1949982524 ("bpf: introduce frags support to
bpf_prog_test_run_xdp()") forgot to call xdp_convert_buff_to_md().</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22995 | ublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22995</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work

A race condition exists between the async partition scan work and device
teardown that can lead to a use-after-free of ub-&gt;ub_disk:

1. ublk_ctrl_start_dev() schedules partition_scan_work after add_disk()
2. ublk_stop_dev() calls ublk_stop_dev_unlocked() which does:
   - del_gendisk(ub-&gt;ub_disk)
   - ublk_detach_disk() sets ub-&gt;ub_disk = NULL
   - put_disk() which may free the disk
3. The worker ublk_partition_scan_work() then dereferences ub-&gt;ub_disk
   leading to UAF

Fix this by using ublk_get_disk()/ublk_put_disk() in the worker to hold
a reference to the disk during the partition scan. The spinlock in
ublk_get_disk() synchronizes with ublk_detach_disk() ensuring the worker
either gets a valid reference or sees NULL and exits early.

Also change flush_work() to cancel_work_sync() to avoid running the
partition scan work unnecessarily when the disk is already detached.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69907 | An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in Newgen OmniDocs due to missing authentication and access control on the /o...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69907</link><description>An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in Newgen OmniDocs due to missing authentication and access control on the /omnidocs/GetListofCabinet API endpoint.

When the core of io_uring was updated to handle completions
consistently and with fixed return codes, the POLL_REMOVE opcode

then POLL_REMOVE is used to update the events of that request, if that
update causes the POLL_ADD to now trigger, then that completion is lost
and a CQE is never posted.

Additionally, ensure that if an update does cause an existing POLL_ADD
to complete, that the completion value isn't always overwritten with
-ECANCELED. For that case, whatever io_poll_add() set the value to
should just be retained.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71150 | ksmbd: Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: properly keep track of conduit reference

Problem description
-------------------

DSA has a mumbo-jumbo of reference handling of the conduit net device
and its kobject which, sadly, is just wrong and doesn't make sense.

There are two distinct problems.

1. The OF path, which uses of_find_net_device_by_node(), never releases
   the elevated refcount on the conduit's kobject. Nominally, the OF and
   non-OF paths should result in objects having identical reference
   counts taken, and it is already suspicious that
   dsa_dev_to_net_device() has a put_device() call which is missing in
   dsa_port_parse_of(), but we can actually even verify that an issue
   exists. With CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y, if we run this command
   "before" and "after" applying this patch:

(unbind the conduit driver for net device eno2)
echo 0000:00:00.2 &gt; /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind

we see these lines in the output diff which appear only with the patch
applied:

kobject: 'eno2' (ffff002009a3a6b8): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)
kobject: '109' (ffff0020099d59a0): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)

2. After we find the conduit interface one way (OF) or another (non-OF),
   it can get unregistered at any time, and DSA remains with a long-lived,
   but in this case stale, cpu_dp-&gt;conduit pointer. Holding the net
   device's underlying kobject isn't actually of much help, it just
   prevents it from being freed (but we never need that kobject
   directly). What helps us to prevent the net device from being
   unregistered is the parallel netdev reference mechanism (dev_hold()
   and dev_put()).

Actually we actually use that netdev tracker mechanism implicitly on
user ports since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 ("net: dsa: link interfaces with
the DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings"), via netdev_upper_dev_link().
But time still passes at DSA switch probe time between the initial
of_find_net_device_by_node() code and the user port creation time, time
during which the conduit could unregister itself and DSA wouldn't know
about it.

So we have to run of_find_net_device_by_node() under rtnl_lock() to
prevent that from happening, and release the lock only with the netdev
tracker having acquired the reference.

Do we need to keep the reference until dsa_unregister_switch() /
dsa_switch_shutdown()?
1: Maybe yes. A switch device will still be registered even if all user
   ports failed to probe, see commit 86f8b1c01a0a ("net: dsa: Do not
   make user port errors fatal"), and the cpu_dp-&gt;conduit pointers
   remain valid.  I haven't audited all call paths to see whether they
   will actually use the conduit in lack of any user port, but if they
   do, it seems safer to not rely on user ports for that reference.
2. Definitely yes. We support changing the conduit which a user port is
   associated to, and we can get into a situation where we've moved all
   user ports away from a conduit, thus no longer hold any reference to
   it via the net device tracker. But we shouldn't let it go nonetheless
   - see the next change in relation to dsa_tree_find_first_conduit()
   and LAG conduits which disappear.
   We have to be prepared to return to the physical conduit, so the CPU
   port must explicitly keep another reference to it. This is also to
   say: the user ports and their CPU ports may not always keep a
   reference to the same conduit net device, and both are needed.

As for the conduit's kobject for the /sys/class/net/ entry, we don't
care about it, we can release it as soon as we hold the net device
object itself.

History and blame attribution
-----------------------------

The code has been refactored so many times, it is very difficult to
follow and properly attribute a blame, but I'll try to make a short
history which I hope to be correct.

We have two distinct probing paths:

ksmbd: Fix memory leak in get_file_all_info()

In get_file_all_info(), if vfs_getattr() fails, the function returns
immediately without freeing the allocated filename, leading to a memory
leak.

Fix this by freeing the filename before returning in this error case.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71154 | net: usb: rtl8150: fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71154</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: rtl8150: fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure

In async_set_registers(), when usb_submit_urb() fails, the allocated
  async_req structure and URB are not freed, causing a memory leak.

  The completion callback async_set_reg_cb() is responsible for freeing
  these allocations, but it is only called after the URB is successfully
  submitted and completes (successfully or with error). If submission
  fails, the callback never runs and the memory is leaked.

  Fix this by freeing both the URB and the request structure in the error
  path when usb_submit_urb() fails.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71155 | KVM: s390: Fix gmap_helper_zap_one_page() again</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71155</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: defer interrupt enabling until NAPI registration

Currently, interrupts are automatically enabled immediately upon
request. This allows interrupt to fire before the associated NAPI
context is fully initialized and cause failures like below:

Use the `IRQF_NO_AUTOEN` flag when requesting interrupts to prevent auto
enablement and explicitly enable the interrupt in NAPI initialization
path (and disable it during NAPI teardown).

This ensures that interrupt lifecycle is strictly coupled with
readiness of NAPI context.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:33:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71157 | RDMA/core: always drop device refcount in ib_del_sub_device_and_put()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71157</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: phy: isp1301: fix non-OF device reference imbalance

A recent change fixing a device reference leak in a UDC driver
introduced a potential use-after-free in the non-OF case as the
isp1301_get_client() helper only increases the reference count for the
returned I2C device in the OF case.

Increment the reference count also for non-OF so that the caller can
decrement it unconditionally.

Note that this is inherently racy just as using the returned I2C device
is since nothing is preventing the PHY driver from being unbound while
in use.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:00:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13921 | weDocs &amp;lt;= 2.1.16 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Documentation Post Update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13921</link><description>The weDocs: AI Powered Knowledge Base, Docs, Documentation, Wiki &amp; AI Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification or loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wedocs_user_documentation_handling_capabilities' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.16.

In versions 1.10.3 and below, the legacy TUF client (pkg/tuf/client.go) supports caching target files to disk. It constructs a filesystem path by joining a cache base directory with a target name sourced from signed target metadata; however, it does not validate that the resulting path stays within the cache base directory. A malicious TUF repository can trigger arbitrary file overwriting, limited to the permissions that the calling process has. Note that this should only affect clients that are directly using the TUF client in sigstore/sigstore or are using an older version of Cosign. Public Sigstore deployment users are unaffected, as TUF metadata is validated by a quorum of trusted collaborators. This issue has been fixed in version 1.10.4. As a workaround, users can disable disk caching for the legacy client by setting SIGSTORE_NO_CACHE=true in the environment, migrate to https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/tree/main/pkg/tuf, or upgrade to the latest sigstore/sigstore release.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 02:25:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24132 | Orval Mock Generation Code Injection via const</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24132</link><description>Orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification.

Versions 3.7.0 and above allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary system commands on the host server by injecting shell metacharacters into backup filenames. The BackupManager fails to sanitize the filenames of uploaded backups. The system persists user-uploaded files directly to the host filesystem using the raw originalname provided in the request. This allows an attacker to stage a file containing shell metacharacters (e.g., $(id).tar.gz) at a predictable path, which is later referenced during the restore process. The successful storage of the file is what allows the subsequent restore command to reference and execute it. This issue has been fixed in version 4.7.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:58:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55705 | EVMAPA Insufficient Session Expiration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55705</link><description>This vulnerability occurs when the system permits multiple simultaneous

When using an image with a metadata.yaml containing templates, both the source and target paths are not checked for symbolic links or directory traversal. This can also be exploited in IncusOS. A fix is planned for versions 6.0.6 and 6.21.0, but they have not been released at the time of publication.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23988 | Rufus has Local Privilege Escalation via TOCTOU Race Condition in Fido Script Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23988</link><description>Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. Versions 4.11 and below contain a race condition (TOCTOU) in src/net.c during the creation, validation, and execution of the Fido PowerShell script. Since Rufus runs with elevated privileges (Administrator) but writes the script to the %TEMP% directory (writeable by standard users) without locking the file, a local attacker can replace the legitimate script with a malicious one between the file write operation and the execution step. This allows arbitrary code execution with Administrator privileges. This issue has been fixed in version 4.12_BETA.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14750 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter in Weintek cMT X Series HMI EasyWeb Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14750</link><description>The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable.

In versions 6.20.0 and below, a user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can create an environment variable containing newlines, which can be used to add additional configuration items in the container’s lxc.conf due to newline injection. This can allow adding arbitrary lifecycle hooks, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host. Exploiting this issue on IncusOS requires a slight modification of the payload to change to a different writable directory for the validation step (e.g /tmp). This can be confirmed with a second container with /tmp mounted from the host (A privileged action for validation only). A fix is planned for versions 6.0.6
and 6.21.0, but they have not been released at the time of publication.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:56:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23831 | Rekor COSE v0.0.1 Canonicalize crashes when passed empty Message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23831</link><description>Rekor is a software supply chain transparency log. In versions 1.4.3 and below, the entry implementation can panic on attacker-controlled input when canonicalizing a proposed entry with an empty spec.message, causing nil Pointer Dereference. Function validate() returns nil (success) when message is empty, leaving sign1Msg uninitialized, and Canonicalize() later dereferences v.sign1Msg.Payload. A malformed proposed entry of the cose/v0.0.1 type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the client receives a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:42:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22234 | Spring Security - BCrypt Password Encoder maximum password length breaks timing attack mitigation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22234</link><description>The fix applied in CVE-2025-22228 inadvertently broke the timing attack mitigation implemented in DaoAuthenticationProvider.

The driver allocates a 128-byte non-paged pool buffer and, upon receiving IOCTL 0x222060, maps it into user space using an MDL and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache. Because the allocation size is not page-aligned, the mapping exposes the entire 0x1000-byte kernel page containing the buffer plus adjacent non-paged pool allocations with read/write permissions. An unprivileged local attacker can open a device handle (using the required 0x800 attribute flag), invoke the IOCTL to obtain the mapping, and then read or modify live kernel objects and pointers present on that page. This enables bypass of KASLR, arbitrary kernel memory read/write within the exposed page, corruption of kernel objects, and escalation to SYSTEM.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:48:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23764 | VB-Audio Voicemeeter &amp;amp; Matrix Drivers DoS via Corrupted IoAllocateMdl Length</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23764</link><description>VB-Audio Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato (versions ending in 1.1.1.9, 2.1.1.9, and 3.1.1.9 and earlier, respectively), as well as VB-Audio Matrix and Matrix Coconut (versions ending in 1.0.2.2 and 2.0.2.2 and earlier, respectively), contain a vulnerability in their virtual audio drivers (vbvoicemeetervaio64*.sys, vbmatrixvaio64*.sys, vbaudio_vmauxvaio*.sys, vbaudio_vmvaio*.sys, and vbaudio_vmvaio3*.sys).

A PyYAML-related Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, namely CVE-2020-14343, is exposed in docling-core starting in version 2.21.0 and prior to version 2.48.4, specifically only if the application uses pyyaml prior to version 5.4 and invokes `docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument.load_from_yaml()` passing it untrusted YAML data. The vulnerability has been patched in docling-core version 2.48.4. The fix mitigates the issue by switching `PyYAML` deserialization from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`, ensuring that untrusted data cannot trigger code execution. Users who cannot immediately upgrade docling-core can alternatively ensure that the installed version of PyYAML is 5.4 or greater.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:43:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64097 | NervesHub has Insufficient Token Entropy that Allows Authentication Bypass via Brute Force</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64097</link><description>NervesHub is a web service that allows users to manage over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates of devices in the field. A vulnerability present starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 2.3.0 allowed attackers to brute-force user API tokens due to the predictable format of previously issued tokens. Tokens included user-identifiable components and were not cryptographically secure, making them susceptible to guessing or enumeration. The vulnerability could have allowed unauthorized access to user accounts or API actions protected by these tokens. A fix is available in version 2.3.0 of NervesHub. This version introduces strong, cryptographically-random tokens using `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes/1`, hashing of tokens before database storage to prevent misuse even if the database is compromised, and context-aware token storage to distinguish between session and API tokens. There are no practical workarounds for this issue other than upgrading. In sensitive environments, as a temporary mitigation,
firewalling access to the NervesHub server can help limit exposure until an upgrade is possible.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:04:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65098 | Typebot Vulnerable to Credential Theft via Client-Side Script Execution and API Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65098</link><description>Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder.

In version 1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request, the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP. If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data, manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse.

Version 1.4.0 has Improper Access Control, allowing low-privileged employees to self-approve documents they have uploaded. The document-approval UI is intended to be restricted to administrator or high-privilege roles only; however, an insufficient server-side authorization check on the approval endpoint lets a standard employee modify the approval status of their own uploaded document. A successful exploitation allows users with only employee-level permissions to alter application state reserved for administrators. This undermines the integrity of HR processes (for example, acceptance of credentials, certifications, or supporting materials), and may enable submission of unvetted documents.

In versions 3.146.0 and below, the /api/public/slack/install endpoint initiates Slack OAuth using a projectId provided by the client without authentication or authorization.

This allows an attacker to bind their Slack workspace to any project and potentially receive changes to prompts stored in Langfuse Prompt Management. An attacker can replace existing Prompt Slack Automation integrations or pre-register a malicious one, though the latter requires an authenticated user to unknowingly configure it despite visible workspace and channel indicators in the UI.

Prior to versions 4.5.5, 4.4.12, and 4.3.18, an insecure direct object reference in the web push subscription update endpoint lets any authenticated user update another user's push subscription by guessing or obtaining the numeric subscription id. This can be used to disrupt push notifications for other users and also leaks the web push subscription endpoint. Any user with a web push subscription is impacted, because another authenticated user can tamper with their push subscription settings if they can guess or obtain the subscription id. This allows an attacker to disrupt push notifications by changing the policy (whether to filter notifications from non-followers or non-followed users) and subscribed notification types of their victims. Additionally, the endpoint returns the subscription object, which includes the push notification endpoint for this subscription, but not its keypair.

Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, if the TUF repository (or any of its mirrors) returns invalid TUF metadata JSON (valid JSON but not well formed TUF metadata), the client will panic during parsing, causing a denial of service. The panic happens before any signature is validated. This means that a compromised repository/mirror/cache can DoS clients without having access to any signing key. Version 2.3.1 fixes the issue.

Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\r`, `\u2028`, or `\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its "leading garbage"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\r`, `\u2028`, or `\u2029`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 02:57:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24002 | pyodide sandbox option is insecure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24002</link><description>Grist is spreadsheet software using Python as its formula language.

Versions 2.3.2 and above are vulnerable to symlink-following when running in privileged contexts. A token-group user can redirect file operations to arbitrary filesystem targets by planting symlinks in group-writable token directories, resulting in privilege escalation or data exposure. Token and lock directories are 0770 (group-writable for token users), so any token-group member can plant files and symlinks inside them. When run as root, the base code handling token directory file access, as well as several openCryptoki tools used for administrative purposes, may reset ownership or permissions on existing files inside the token directories. An attacker with token-group membership can exploit the system when an administrator runs a PKCS#11 application or administrative tool that performs chown on files inside the token directory during normal maintenance.

Starting in version 0.36.0 and prior to version 0.40.0, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Flux Operator Web UI authentication code that allows an attacker to bypass Kubernetes RBAC impersonation and execute API requests with the operator's service account privileges. In order to be vulnerable, cluster admins must configure the Flux Operator with an OIDC provider that issues tokens lacking the expected claims (e.g., `email`, `groups`), or configure custom CEL expressions that can evaluate to empty values. After OIDC token claims are processed through CEL expressions, there is no validation that the resulting `username` and `groups` values are non-empty. When both values are empty, the Kubernetes client-go library does not add impersonation headers to API requests, causing them to be executed with the flux-operator service account's credentials instead of the authenticated user's limited permissions. This can result in privilege escalation, data exposure, and/or information disclosure.

Version 1.1.0 has a timing side-channel vulnerability in verify_key(). The method applied a random delay only on verification failures, allowing an attacker to statistically distinguish valid from invalid API keys by measuring response latencies. With enough repeated requests, an adversary could infer whether a key_id corresponds to a valid key, potentially accelerating brute-force or enumeration attacks. All users relying on verify_key() for API key authentication prior to the fix are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. The patch applies a uniform random delay (min_delay to max_delay) to all responses regardless of outcome, eliminating the timing correlation. Some workarounds are available.

Multiple Scaffolder actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable to symlink-based path traversal attacks. An attacker with access to create and execute Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks to read arbitrary files via the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets); delete arbitrary files via the `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace, and write files outside the workspace via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious symlinks. This affects any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute Scaffolder templates. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-defaults` versions 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0; `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` versions 2.2.2, 3.0.2, and 3.1.1; and `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` versions 0.11.2 and 0.12.3.

Prior to version 9.11.2, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with `_preserve_symlinks: true` and a generated directory structure whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. Version 9.11.2 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23524 | Laravel Redis Horizontal Scaling Insecure Deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23524</link><description>Laravel Reverb provides a real-time WebSocket communication backend for Laravel applications. In versions 1.6.3 and below, Reverb passes data from the Redis channel directly into PHP’s unserialize() function without restricting which classes can be instantiated, which leaves users vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The exploitability of this vulnerability is increased because Redis servers are commonly deployed without authentication, but only affects Laravel Reverb when horizontal scaling is enabled (REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true). This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0. As a workaround, require a strong password for Redis access and ensure the service is only accessible via a private network or local loopback, and/or set REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=false to bypass the vulnerable logic entirely (if the environment uses only one Reverb node).</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:15:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23960 | Argo Workflows affected by stored XSS in the artifact directory listing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23960</link><description>Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.

Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.20.108, 3.21.43, and 3.22.27, Saleor allowed authenticated staff users or Apps to upload arbitrary files, including malicious HTML and SVG files containing Javascript. Depending on the deployment strategy, these files may be served from the same domain as the dashboard without any restrictions leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser. Malicious staff members could craft script injections to target other staff members, possibly stealing their access and/or refresh tokens. Users are vulnerable if they host the media files inside the same domain as the dashboard, e.g., dashboard is at `example.com/dashboard/` and media are under `example.com/media/`. They are not impact if media files are hosted in a different domain, e.g., `media.example.com`. Users are impacted if they do not return a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header for the media files. Saleor Cloud users are not impacted. This issue has been patched in versions: 3.22.27, 3.21.43, and 3.20.108. Some workarounds are available for those unable to upgrade. Configure the servers hosting the media files (e.g., CDN or reverse proxy) to return the Content-Disposition: attachment header. This instructs browsers to download the file instead of rendering them in the browser. Prevent the servers from returning HTML and SVG files. Set-up a `Content-Security-Policy` for media files, such as `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none';`.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:53:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23516 | CVAT vulnerable to XSS via skeleton SVG images</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23516</link><description>CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.

Prior to version 2025.9.0, once the validity of the received V2G message has been verified, it is checked whether the submitted session ID matches the registered one. However, if no session has been registered, the default value is 0. Therefore, a message submitted with a session ID of 0 is accepted, as it matches the registered value.

This behavior matches what is recommended in earlier base64 RFCs, but newer RFCs now recommend either dropping characters outside the specified base64 alphabet or raising an error. The old behavior has the possibility of causing data integrity issues.




This behavior can only be insecure if your application uses an alternate base64 alphabet (without "+/"). If your application does not use the "altchars" parameter or the urlsafe_b64decode() function, then your application does not use an alternative base64 alphabet.




The attached patches DOES NOT make the base64-decode behavior raise an error, as this would be a change in behavior and break existing programs. Instead, the patch deprecates the behavior which will be replaced with the newly recommended behavior in a future version of Python. Users are recommended to mitigate by verifying user-controlled inputs match the base64 
alphabet they are expecting or verify that their application would not be 
affected if the b64decode() functions accepted "+" or "/" outside of altchars.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:58:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68138 | EVerest affected by memory exhaustion in libocpp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68138</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack, and EVerest libocpp is a C++ implementation of the Open Charge Point Protocol.

In all versions up to and including 2025.12.1, the default value for `terminate_connection_on_failed_response` is `False`, which leaves the responsibility for session and connection termination to the EV. In this configuration, any errors encountered by the module are logged but do not trigger countermeasures such as session and connection reset or termination. This could be abused by a malicious user in order to exploit other weaknesses or vulnerabilities. While the default will stay at the setting that is described as potentially problematic in this reported issue, a mitigation is available by changing the `terminate_connection_on_failed_response`  setting to `true`. However this cannot be set to this value by default since it can trigger errors in vehicle ECUs requiring ECU resets and lengthy unavailability in charging for vehicles. The maintainers judge this to be a much more important workaround then short-term unavailability of an EVSE, therefore this setting will stay at the current value.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:58:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68136 | EVerest&amp;#x27;s inadequate session handling can lead to memory-related errors or exhaustion of the operating system’s file descriptors, resulting in a denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68136</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack.

In a context where a manager handles multiple EVSE, this would also impact other users. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:04:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23754 | D-Link D-View 8 IDOR Allows Credential Disclosure and Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23754</link><description>D-Link D-View 8 versions 2.0.1.107 and below contain an improper access control vulnerability in backend API endpoints.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain user-level access to the underlying operating system and then elevate privileges to root.
Note: Cisco has assigned this security advisory a Security Impact Rating (SIR) of Critical rather than High as the score indicates. The reason is that exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker elevating privileges to root.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:42:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20055 | Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise &amp;amp; Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20055</link><description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.&amp;nbsp;

  *  Use of Solr's "RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin config (see security.json) that specifies multiple "roles"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list (see security.json) that uses one or more of the following pre-defined permission rules: "config-read", "config-edit", "schema-read", "metrics-read", or "security-read".
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list that doesn't define the "all" pre-defined permission
  *  A networking setup that allows clients to make unfiltered network requests to Solr. (i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)

Users can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the "all" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an "admin" or other privileged role.  Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22444 | Apache Solr: Insufficient file-access checking in standalone core-creation requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22444</link><description>The "create core" API of Apache Solr 8.6 through 9.10.0 lacks sufficient input validation on some API parameters, which can cause Solr to check the existence of and attempt to read file-system paths that should be disallowed by Solr's  "allowPaths" security setting https://https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuring-solr-xml.html#the-solr-element .  These read-only accesses can allow users to create cores using unexpected configsets if any are accessible via the filesystem.  On Windows systems configured to allow UNC paths this can additionally cause disclosure of NTLM "user" hashes. 

Solr deployments are subject to this vulnerability if they meet the following criteria:
  *  Solr is running in its "standalone" mode.
  *  Solr's "allowPath" setting is being used to restrict file access to certain directories.
  *  Solr's "create core" API is exposed and accessible to untrusted users.  This can happen if Solr's  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/rule-based-authorization-plugin.html  is disabled, or if it is enabled but the "core-admin-edit" predefined permission (or an equivalent custom permission) is given to low-trust (i.e. non-admin) user roles.

Users can mitigate this by enabling Solr's RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (if disabled) and configuring a permission-list that prevents untrusted users from creating new Solr cores.  Users should also upgrade to Apache Solr 9.10.1 or greater, which contain fixes for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22977 | net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22977</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue

skbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,
[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.
[2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is
enabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace
via sock_recv_errqueue() -&gt; put_cmsg().

The crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()
   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]
2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone
[3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp
reporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE)
5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr-&gt;ee from skb-&gt;cb
[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no
   usercopy whitelist [5]

When cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the
socket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb-&gt;cb
via put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:

The crash offset 296 corresponds to skb2-&gt;cb within skbuff_fclones:
  - sizeof(struct sk_buff) = 232 - offsetof(struct sk_buff, cb) = 40 -
  offset of skb2.cb in fclones = 232 + 40 = 272 - crash offset 296 =
  272 + 24 (inside sock_exterr_skb.ee)

This patch uses a local stack variable as a bounce buffer to avoid the hardened usercopy check failure.

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset

`qfq_class-&gt;leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0` does not imply that the class
itself is active.

Two qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens
when:

1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and

2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get()
/ qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function
tc_new_tfilter.

When packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared
leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ
qdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters
qfq_reset() with its own q-&gt;q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf
qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate
an inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:

When strict refresh token rotation is enabled, the validation and update of refresh token usage are not performed atomically. This allows concurrent refresh requests to bypass single-use enforcement and issue multiple access tokens from the same refresh token. As a result, Keycloak’s refresh token rotation hardening can be undermined.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:23:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68133 | EVerest&amp;#x27;s unlimited connections can lead to DoS through operating system resource exhaustion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68133</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In versions 2025.9.0 and below, an attacker can exhaust the operating system's memory and cause the module to terminate by initiating an unlimited number of TCP connections that never proceed to ISO 15118-2 communication. This is possible because a new thread is started for each incoming plain TCP or TLS socket connection before any verification occurs, and the verification performed is too permissive. The EVerest processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE functionality. This issue is fixed in version 2025.10.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:10:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15521 | Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution &amp;lt;= 3.5.0 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15521</link><description>The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password and relying solely on a publicly-exposed nonce for authorization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's password, including administrators, and gain access to their account.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:10:53 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
