mm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking

Recent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:
under load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,
"Bad page state"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually
don't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent
changes being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,
improved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.

Before fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),
which does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),
which is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm
internals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to
check usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,
which can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing
callers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).

Just omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all
of whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()
will tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no
longer has any callers (and will be deleted separately).

Swapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio-&gt;memcg_data 0
without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;
which is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg
(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,
when freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially
corrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0
here, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before
resetting memcg_data.

That goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 ("mm: thp: make deferred split
shrinker memcg aware"): which included a check on swapcache before adding
to deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to
swapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim
(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue
could have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 ("mm: split
underused THPs") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes
swapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.

Keep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is
no longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely
to be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the
queue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.

Memcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing
folio-&gt;memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the
deferred list, sometimes corrupting "from" memcg's list, like swapout. 
Refcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be
used in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:
mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting
of course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving
charge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:
nobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.

The 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list
to another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);
but that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 ("mm: thp: don't need care
deferred split queue in memcg charge move path"), which argued that the
existence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred
list.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.

Backport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take
care that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There
is not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53080 | drm/panthor: Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53080</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: Break an object reference loop

When remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,
outstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, due
to an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (or
set of objects) referencing the object below it:

    PVR GEM Object
    GPU scheduler "finished" fence
    GPU scheduler “scheduled” fence
    PVR driver “done” fence
    PVR Context
    PVR VM Context
    PVR VM Mappings
    PVR GEM Object

The reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is a
soft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappings
is done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts are
involved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.

To break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstanding
VM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with the
VM context.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53085 | tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53085</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first

Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy
according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while
the operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of
this behaviour.

Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip-&gt;flags both
in tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED
check inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when
the lock is reserved.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53086 | drm/xe: Drop VM dma-resv lock on xe_sync_in_fence_get failure in exec IOCTL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53086</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10224 | Qualys discovered that if unsanitized input was used with the library Modules::ScanDeps, before version 1.36 a local attacker could possibly...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10224</link><description>Qualys discovered that if unsanitized input was used with the library Modules::ScanDeps, before version 1.36 a local attacker could possibly execute arbitrary shell commands by open()ing a "pesky pipe" (such as passing "commands|" as a filename) or by passing arbitrary strings to eval().</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:42:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11003 | Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, passes unsanitized data to a library (Modules::ScanDeps) which expects safe input.

riscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodes

When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node
at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a
specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for
the node that was acquired.

Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we
can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and
we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.
This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.

Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring
the device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:42:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53076 | iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53076</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is also needed for High Availability function of the Versa Director. The default configuration has a common password across all instances of Versa Director. By default, Versa Director configures Postgres to listen on all network interfaces. This combination allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and administer the database or read local filesystem contents to escalate privileges on the system. 

Exploitation Status:
Versa Networks is not aware of this exploitation in any production systems. A proof of concept exists in the lab environment.

Workarounds or Mitigation:
Starting with the latest 22.1.4 version of Versa Director, the software will automatically restrict access to the Postgres and HA ports to only the local and peer Versa Directors. For older releases, Versa recommends performing manual hardening of HA ports. Please refer to the following link for the steps https://docs.versa-networks.com/Solutions/System_Hardening/Perform_Manual_Hardening_for_Versa_Director#Secure_HA_Ports  

This vulnerability is not exploitable on Versa Directors if published Firewall guidelines are implemented. We have validated that no Versa-hosted head ends have been affected by this vulnerability. All Versa-hosted head ends are patched and hardened. 

Please contact Versa Technical Support or Versa account team for any further assistance.

walk_system_ram_res_rev() erroneously discards resource flags when passing
the information to the callback.

This causes systems with IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED memory to have
these resources selected during kexec to store kexec buffers if that
memory happens to be at placed above normal system ram.

This leads to undefined behavior after reboot.  If the kexec buffer is
never touched, nothing happens.  If the kexec buffer is touched, it could
lead to a crash (like below) or undefined behavior.

Tested on a system with CXL memory expanders with driver managed memory,
TPM enabled, and CONFIG_IMA_KEXEC=y.  Adding printk's showed the flags
were being discarded and as a result the check for
IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED passes.

ipv4: ip_tunnel: Fix suspicious RCU usage warning in ip_tunnel_find()

The per-netns IP tunnel hash table is protected by the RTNL mutex and
ip_tunnel_find() is only called from the control path where the mutex is
taken.

Add a lockdep expression to hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() in
ip_tunnel_find() in order to validate that the mutex is held and to
silence the suspicious RCU usage warning [1].

ipv4: ip_tunnel: Fix suspicious RCU usage warning in ip_tunnel_init_flow()

There are code paths from which the function is called without holding
the RCU read lock, resulting in a suspicious RCU usage warning [1].

Fix by using l3mdev_master_upper_ifindex_by_index() which will acquire
the RCU read lock before calling
l3mdev_master_upper_ifindex_by_index_rcu().

net/sched: sch_api: fix xa_insert() error path in tcf_block_get_ext()

This command:

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: block dev insert failed: -EBUSY.

fails because user space requests the same block index to be set for
both ingress and egress.

[ side note, I don't think it even failed prior to commit 913b47d3424e
  ("net/sched: Introduce tc block netdev tracking infra"), because this
  is a command from an old set of notes of mine which used to work, but
  alas, I did not scientifically bisect this ]

The problem is not that it fails, but rather, that the second time
around, it fails differently (and irrecoverably):

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

[ another note: the extack is added by me for illustration purposes.
  the context of the problem is that clsact_init() obtains the same
  &amp;amp;q-&gt;ingress_block pointer as &amp;amp;q-&gt;egress_block, and since we call
  tcf_block_get_ext() on both of them, "dev" will be added to the
  block-&gt;ports xarray twice, thus failing the operation: once through
  the ingress block pointer, and once again through the egress block
  pointer. the problem itself is that when xa_insert() fails, we have
  emitted a FLOW_BLOCK_BIND command through ndo_setup_tc(), but the
  offload never sees a corresponding FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND. ]

Even correcting the bad user input, we still cannot recover:

$ tc qdisc replace dev swp3 ingress_block 1 egress_block 2 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

Basically the only way to recover is to reboot the system, or unbind and
rebind the net device driver.

To fix the bug, we need to fill the correct error teardown path which
was missed during code movement, and call tcf_block_offload_unbind()
when xa_insert() fails.

[ last note, fundamentally I blame the label naming convention in
  tcf_block_get_ext() for the bug. The labels should be named after what
  they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is
  obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean
  something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site
  is also easier ]</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53045 | ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53045</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create

The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by
attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This
attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with
list_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for
allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of
added elements after the array is filled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53046 | arm64: dts: imx8ulp: correct the flexspi compatible string</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53046</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM

The E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intel
provides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final
product design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static
values defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design.
Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe
of the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:

WARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330

The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected
and defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.

Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL
subsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.

Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on "per HW
design" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically
acquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for
next-tree only.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53049 | slub/kunit: fix a WARNING due to unwrapped __kmalloc_cache_noprof</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in
turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.

Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't
something that can be triggered by a regular user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53053 | scsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53053</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue can be reproduced by the following pressuse test:
1. A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.
2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.
3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.
The scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.

The reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are
acquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.
It can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:
1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a
   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active
   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are
   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put
   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in
   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.
2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put
   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled
   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has
   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier
   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.
3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.
4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into
   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.
   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will
   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.
   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.
5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are
   cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as
   a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be
   executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being
   blocked, forming a deadlock.

system_wq(step1)		WatchDog(step2)			cpu offline(step3)	cgroup_destroy_wq(step4)
...
2000+ cgroups deleted asyn
256 actives + n inactives

To fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicated
workqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem. System wqs are
for misc things which shouldn't create a large number of concurrent work
items. If something is going to generate &gt;

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction

If more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all
APs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scan
construction will loop forever since the loop variable
has type u8, which can never reach the number found when
that's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable.
Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.

Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in
the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR
entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan
results, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's
more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11,
we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in
the bounds of a u32.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53056 | drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53056</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT

In qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed
to be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid
to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:
Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active
class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.

In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress
qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent
TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a
hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into
qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).

In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree
levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the
iteration must stop.

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53064 | idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53064</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

reset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At this
time if the device control plane is not yet started, then
the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to
establish the mailbox again.

In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox
workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message.
This results in accessing the released control queue leading to
null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation
and mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they got
initialized.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53065 | mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53065</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create

Commit b035f5a6d852 ("mm: slab: reduce the kmalloc() minimum alignment
if DMA bouncing possible") reduced ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN to 8 on arm64.
However, with KASAN_HW_TAGS enabled, arch_slab_minalign() becomes 16.
This causes kmalloc_caches[*][8] to be aliased to kmalloc_caches[*][16],
resulting in kmem_buckets_create() attempting to create a kmem_cache for
size 16 twice. This duplication triggers warnings on boot:

drm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flags

The current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:

1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,
   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear
   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping
   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.
   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:
   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and
   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the
   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing
   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*
   flushes happen.

2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are
   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).
   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has
   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but
   fairly cursed.
   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs
   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()
   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into
   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault
   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so
   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when
   it hits a BUG() check.

Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID
doesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for
the FLUSH_ID don't make sense).

Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing
list; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.

Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't
have a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it
before applying it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53072 | platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available

Loading the amd_pmc module as:

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for customizing behavior, and includes ConfigProvider plugins in order to manipulate these configurations. Apache Kafka also provides FileConfigProvider, DirectoryConfigProvider, and EnvVarConfigProvider implementations which include the ability to read from disk or environment variables.
In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use these ConfigProviders to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables.

In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products.
This issue affects Apache Kafka Clients: from 2.3.0 through 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.0.


Users with affected applications are recommended to upgrade kafka-clients to version &gt;=3.8.0, and set the JVM system property "org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none".
Users of Kafka Connect with one of the listed ConfigProvider implementations specified in their worker config are also recommended to add appropriate "allowlist.pattern" and "allowed.paths" to restrict their operation to appropriate bounds.


For users of Kafka Clients or Kafka Connect in environments that trust users with disk and environment variable access, it is not recommended to set the system property.
For users of the Kafka Broker, Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0, Kafka Streams, and Kafka command-line tools, it is not recommended to set the system property.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 08:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10268 | MP3 Audio Player – Music Player, Podcast Player &amp;amp; Radio by Sonaar &amp;lt;= 5.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sonaar_audioplayer Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10268</link><description>The MP3 Audio Player – Music Player, Podcast Player &amp; Radio by Sonaar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's sonaar_audioplayer shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

The reporting functionality in Graylog allows the creation and scheduling of reports which contain dashboard widgets displaying individual log messages or metrics aggregated from fields of multiple log messages. This functionality, as included in Graylog 6.1.0 &amp; 6.1.1, is vulnerable to information leakage triggered by multiple concurrent report rendering requests from authorized users. When multiple report renderings are requested at the same start time, the headless browser instance used to render the PDF will be reused. Depending on the timing, either a check for the browser instance "freshness" hits, resulting in an error instead of the report being returned, or one of the concurrent report rendering requests "wins" and this report is returned for all report rendering requests that do not return an error. This might lead to one user getting the report of a different user, potentially leaking indexed log messages or aggregated data that this user normally has no access to. This problem is fixed in Graylog 6.1.2. There is no known workaround besides disabling the reporting functionality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50804 | Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Micro-star International MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50804</link><description>Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Micro-star International MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the Device_DeviceID.dat.bak file within the C:\ProgramData\MSI\One Dragon Center\Data folder</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50849 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Rules" functionality in WordServer 11.8.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary cod...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50849</link><description>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Rules" functionality in WordServer 11.8.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 20:32:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52304 | aiohttp vulnerable to request smuggling due to incorrect parsing of chunk extensions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52304</link><description>aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.

The `XmlScanner` class has a scan method which should prevent XXE attacks. However, in a bypass of the previously reported `CVE-2024-47873`, the regexes from the `findCharSet` method, which is used for determining the current encoding can be bypassed by using a payload in the encoding UTF-7, and adding at end of the file a comment with the value `encoding="UTF-8"` with `"`, which is matched by the first regex, so that `encoding='UTF-7'` with single quotes `'` in the XML header is not matched by the second regex. An attacker can bypass the sanitizer and achieve an XML external entity attack.

Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:25:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52431 | WordPress WP Video Robot plugin &amp;lt;= 1.20.0 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52431</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Pressaholic WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer allows SQL Injection.This issue affects WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer: from n/a through 1.20.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:47:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52435 | WordPress Premium Packages – Sell Digital Products Securely plugin &amp;lt;= 5.9.3 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52435</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in W3 Eden, Inc.
