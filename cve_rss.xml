Using well-crafted inputs to `git_index_add` can cause heap corruption that could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. There is an issue in the `has_dir_name` function in `src/libgit2/index.c`, which frees an entry that should not be freed. The freed entry is later used and overwritten with potentially bad actor-controlled data leading to controlled heap corruption. Depending on the application that uses libgit2, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 21:42:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42765 | Westermo Lynx Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42765</link><description>An attacker with access to the vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the "username" parameter in the SNMP configuration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 21:42:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1260 | Juanpao JPShop API ComboController.php actionIndex unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1260</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Juanpao JPShop up to 1.5.02.

Using well-crafted inputs to `git_revparse_single` can cause the function to enter an infinite loop, potentially causing a Denial of Service attack in the calling application. The revparse function in `src/libgit2/revparse.c` uses a loop to parse the user-provided spec string. There is an edge-case during parsing that allows a bad actor to force the loop conditions to access arbitrary memory. Potentially, this could also leak memory if the extracted rev spec is reflected back to the attacker. As such, libgit2 versions before 1.4.0 are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.6.5 or 1.7.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 21:35:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45227 | Westermo Lynx Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45227</link><description>An attacker with access to the web application with vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the "dns.0.server" parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 21:27:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38579 | Westermo Lynx 206-F2G Cross-Site Request Forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38579</link><description>The cross-site request forgery token in the request may be predictable or easily guessable allowing attackers to craft a malicious request, which could be triggered by a victim unknowingly.

This is potentially unwanted, e.g., because there is no public documentation of security measures for the private key, and arbitrary software could be signed if the private key were to be compromised. NOTE: the vendor's position is "we do not have EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround." Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities was the originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate installation step (checked by default) was visible to the user before proceeding with the product installation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 08:29:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-32479 | Dell Encryption, Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise, and Dell Security Management Server versions prior to 11.9.0 contain privilege esc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32479</link><description>Dell Encryption, Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise, and Dell Security Management Server versions prior to 11.9.0 contain privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper ACL of the non-default installation directory.

The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages.

The front-end of this page doesn't allow changing the form details, an attacker can utilize a proxy to intercept this request and submit other data. Upon submitting this form, an email is sent to the administrator informing them that this user wants to delete their account. An administrator has no way of telling the difference between the actual user wishing to delete their account or the attacker issuing this for an account they do not control.

Engrampa is found to be vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve full Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the target. While handling CPIO archives, the Engrampa Archive manager follows symlink, cpio by default will follow stored symlinks while extracting and the Archiver will not check the symlink location, which leads to arbitrary file writes to unintended locations. When the victim extracts the archive, the attacker can craft a malicious cpio or ISO archive to achieve RCE on the target system.

When using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular Expression to parse the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker could send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for the RegEx to process, consuming CPU resources and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding the main event loop. This means that process can't handle any more requests. It's a ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service), it only applies to those reading form data, using `python-multipart`.

Rothel from QED Secure Solutions has found that the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi
did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a possible remote code
execution. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an
operator- or administrator-privileged service account. The impact of exploiting
this vulnerability is lower with operator-privileges compared to
administrator-privileges service accounts. Axis has released patched AXIS OS
versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory
for more information and solution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 05:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5800 | Insufficient input validation in VAPIX API create_overlay.cgi</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5800</link><description>Vintage,
