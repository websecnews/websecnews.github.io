If this cookie field is preset via an attacker by any other method, the attacker can manipulate the "_authTokenSyncURL" to point to their own server and it would allow am actor to capture user session data transmitted by the SDK. We recommend upgrading Firebase JS SDK at least to 10.9.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 10:42:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-39176 | Kernel: ksmbd: transform header out-of-bounds read information disclosure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39176</link><description>A flaw was found within the parsing of SMB2 requests that have a transform header in the kernel ksmbd module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Linux.
