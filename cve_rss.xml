All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically,  it's possible to crash the repo server component through an out of memory error by pointing it to a malicious Helm registry. The loadRepoIndex() function in the ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data. It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating memory until it runs out of it. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in v2.10.3, v2.9.8, and v2.8.12.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 15:15:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29890 | Remote code execution in datalens-ui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29890</link><description>DataLens is a business intelligence and data visualization system.

sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
switch_drv_remove()              |
 flush_work()                    |
  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                 |   schedule_work(&amp;psw-&gt;work)
 timer_shutdown_sync()           |
 ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
 kfree(psw) // free              |
                                 |   psw-&gt;state = 0 // use

This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
stopped safely before the deallocate operations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 09:22:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2409 | The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1.

The permission `view_other_timesheet` performs differently for the Kimai UI and the API, thus returning unexpected data through the API. When setting the `view_other_timesheet` permission to true, on the frontend, users can only see timesheet entries for teams they are a part of. When requesting all timesheets from the API, however, all timesheet entries are returned, regardless of whether the user shares team permissions or not. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.13.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 13:35:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30592 | Tenda FH1202 v1.2.0.14(408) has a stack overflow vulnerability in the page parameter of the fromAddressNat function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30592</link><description>Tenda FH1202 v1.2.0.14(408) has a stack overflow vulnerability in the page parameter of the fromAddressNat function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 13:35:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28109 | Potential XSLT injection vulnerability when using policy files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28109</link><description>veraPDF-library is a PDF/A validation library.

netfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write

If priv-&gt;len is a multiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past
the destination array which leads to stack corruption.

This construct is necessary to clean the remainder of the register
in case -&gt;len is NOT a multiple of the register size, so make it
conditional just like nft_payload.c does.

The bug was added in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when
tcp/sctp and ip option support was added.
