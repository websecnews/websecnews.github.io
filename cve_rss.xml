x86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before "getting" registers

The x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers
are XSAVE-managed, but they are "supervisor state components" which means
that userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that
they are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.
Thus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.

The regset code that ptrace uses provides an -&gt;active() handler in
addition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -&gt;active() handler
verifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the
thread struct. The -&gt;active() handler is checked from some call sites of
the regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not
understood when shadow stack support was put in place.

As a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with
XFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to
return NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an
ssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack
behavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That
check just happened to avoid the warning.

But the -&gt;get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks
disabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina
Schimpe:

Ensure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up
in the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are
set at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be
something to find in the XSAVE buffer.

				kernfs_unbreak_active_protection
				// active = 0x80000002
...
kernfs_should_drain_open_files
// warning occurs
				kernfs_put_active

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 ("cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 ("cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d ("cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:33:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21635 | rds: sysctl: rds_tcp_{rcv,snd}buf: avoid using current-&amp;gt;nsproxy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21635</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

to that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table
linked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with
the reader's or writer's netns.

Another reason is that access to current-&gt;nsproxy-&gt;netns can oops if
attempted when current-&gt;nsproxy had been dropped when the current task
is exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):

netfs: Fix kernel async DIO

Netfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that
is supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,
this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and
fails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be
triggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev with
something like:

        mount //my/cifs/share /foo
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K
        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0
        echo hello &gt;/dev/loop2046

This causes the following to appear in syslog:

        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50 netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]

and the write to fail.

Fix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() that
causes async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Note
that this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence of
the bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:33:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21644 | drm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedging</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21644</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedging

If GuC fails to load, the driver wedges, but in the process it tries to
do stuff that may not be initialized yet. This moves the
xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier: as its own doc says,
it's a software-only initialization and should had been named with the
_early() suffix.

Move it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno are
initialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging:

	xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: load failed: status: Reset = 0, BootROM = 0x50, UKernel = 0x00, MIA = 0x00, Auth = 0x01

	RIP: 0010:xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_reset+0x75/0x110 [xe]

This can be easily triggered by poking the GuC binary to force a

	xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: GuC mmio request 0x4100: no reply 0x4100

but that's better than a NULL ptr deref.

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it

Wakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 had
actually enabled it, otherwise "wake_depth" for this IRQ will try to
drop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged:

kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platform firmware bug
kernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------
kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disable
kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0

The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_ops
which sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and
.poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set as
the .suspend handler.

Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of
dev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means just
the .suspend handler.

To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot
without putting it into s2idle first.

afs: Fix the maximum cell name length

The kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but a
problem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create a
directory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that fails
with a warning:

        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405

because procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255.

However, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, the
maximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL).

Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  This
also allows us to be sure we can create the "/afs/.&lt;cell&gt;/" mountpoint too.

Further, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by
the protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it
exceeds 253.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:33:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21647 | sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21647</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:33:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21648 | netfilter: conntrack: clamp maximum hashtable size to INT_MAX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21648</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fixed hclge_fetch_pf_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue

The TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs
1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However,
hclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when
reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater
than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs.
The problem of different segments has been considered during the
initialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used
when the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.

ipvlan: Fix use-after-free in ipvlan_get_iflink().

syzbot presented an use-after-free report [0] regarding ipvlan and
linkwatch.

ipvlan does not hold a refcnt of the lower device unlike vlan and
macvlan.

If the linkwatch work is triggered for the ipvlan dev, the lower dev
might have already been freed, resulting in UAF of ipvlan-&gt;phy_dev in
ipvlan_get_iflink().

We can delay the lower dev unregistration like vlan and macvlan by
holding the lower dev's refcnt in dev-&gt;netdev_ops-&gt;ndo_init() and
releasing it in dev-&gt;priv_destructor().

Jakub pointed out calling .ndo_XXX after unregister_netdevice() has
returned is error prone and suggested [1] addressing this UAF in the
core by taking commit 750e51603395 ("net: avoid potential UAF in
default_operstate()") further.

Let's assume unregistering devices DOWN and use RCU protection in
default_operstate() not to race with the device unregistration.

ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias

Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by
userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched
inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.

The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed, because
it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond
this assertion.

As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to
encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to
failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.

As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails
if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed.
ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable
file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info,
ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.

Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh()
will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0567 | Epic Games Launcher Installer profapi.dll untrusted search path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0567</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Epic Games Launcher up to 17.2.1.

The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 22:27:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0541 | Codezips Gym Management System edit_member.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0541</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Codezips Gym Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.

Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow. However, the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate, upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). Once upgraded, users should make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`.

Enabling frame-ancestors: 'self' grants any JupyterHub user the ability to extract formgrader content by sending malicious links to users with access to formgrader, at least when using the default JupyterHub configuration of `enable_subdomains = False`. #1915 disables a protection which would allow user Alice to craft a page embedding formgrader in an IFrame. If Bob visits that page, his credentials will be sent and the formgrader page loaded. Because Alice's page is on the same Origin as the formgrader iframe, Javasript on Alice's page has _full access_ to the contents of the page served by formgrader using Bob's credentials. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `frame-ancestors: self`, or enable per-user and per-service subdomains with `JupyterHub.enable_subdomains = True` (then even if embedding in an IFrame is allowed, the host page does not have access to the contents of the frame).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:31:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57033 | WeGIA &lt; 3.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the dados_addInfo parameter of documentos_funcionario.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57033</link><description>WeGIA &lt; 3.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the dados_addInfo parameter of documentos_funcionario.php.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:21:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57035 | WeGIA v3.2.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection viathe nextPage parameter in /controle/control.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57035</link><description>WeGIA v3.2.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection viathe nextPage parameter in /controle/control.php.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:21:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21606 | Local Privilege Escalation via Exposed XPC Method Due to Client Verification Failure in stats</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21606</link><description>stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the user’s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade.
