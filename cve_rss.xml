This vulnerability is due to a timing issue that occurs between various software components. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to put a malicious file into a specific folder and then persuading the user to execute the file within a limited time window. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the endpoint software to fail to quarantine the malicious file or kill its process. Note: This vulnerability only applies to deployments that have the Windows Folder Redirection feature enabled.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 17:28:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20240 | Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Secure Client Software, formerly AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, could allow an authenticated, local at...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20240</link><description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Secure Client Software, formerly AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system.

Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct workaround available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:24:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26542 | WordPress phpinfo() WP Plugin &amp;lt;= 4.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26542</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Exeebit phpinfo() WP plugin &lt;= 4.0 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47380 | Admidio v4.2.12 and below is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47380</link><description>Admidio v4.2.12 and below is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 15:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26535 | WordPress Sheets To WP Table Live Sync Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.12.15 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26535</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WPPOOL Sheets To WP Table Live Sync plugin &lt;= 2.12.15 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:31:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26532 | WordPress Social Auto Poster Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1.4 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26532</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in AccessPress Themes Social Auto Poster plugin &lt;= 2.1.4 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:31:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-27457 | WordPress Add Expires Headers &amp;amp; Optimized Minify Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27457</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Passionate Brains Add Expires Headers &amp; Optimized Minify plugin &lt;= 2.7 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:31:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-27458 | WordPress WpStream – Live Streaming, Video on Demand, Pay Per View Plugin &amp;lt;= 4.4.10 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27458</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wpstream WpStream plugin &lt;= 4.4.10 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-27461 | WordPress When Last Login Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27461</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Yoohoo Plugins When Last Login plugin &lt;= 1.2.1 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-27451 | WordPress Instant Images Plugin &amp;lt;= 5.1.0.2 is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27451</link><description>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Darren Cooney Instant Images plugin &lt;= 5.1.0.2 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 13:50:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-27453 | WordPress LWS Tools Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27453</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in LWS LWS Tools plugin &lt;= 2.3.1 versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 13:50:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6252 | Path traversal vulnerability in Chameleon Power products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6252</link><description>Path traversal vulnerability in Chalemelon Power framework, affecting the getImage parameter.

The graphapi app relies on a third-party GetPhpInfo.php library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of the webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, and license key. Simply disabling the graphapi app does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally, phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to gather information about the system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this vulnerability should still be a cause for concern. Note that Docker containers from before February 2023 are not vulnerable to the credential disclosure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 21:32:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49104 | An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/oauth2 before 0.6.1, when Allow Subdomains is enabled.

In versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, when using the KJ HTTP library with WebSocket compression enabled, a buffer underrun can be caused by a remote peer. The underrun always writes a constant value that is not attacker-controlled, likely resulting in a crash, enabling a remote denial-of-service attack. Most Cap'n Proto and KJ users are unlikely to have this functionality enabled and so unlikely to be affected. Maintainers suspect only the Cloudflare Workers Runtime is affected.

If KJ HTTP is used with WebSocket compression enabled, a malicious peer may be able to cause a buffer underrun on a heap-allocated buffer. KJ HTTP is an optional library bundled with Cap'n Proto, but is not directly used by Cap'n Proto. WebSocket compression is disabled by default. It must be enabled via a setting passed to the KJ HTTP library via `HttpClientSettings` or `HttpServerSettings`. The bytes written out-of-bounds are always a specific constant 4-byte string `{ 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF }`. Because this string is not controlled by the attacker, maintainers believe it is unlikely that remote code execution is possible. However, it cannot be ruled out. This functionality first appeared in Cap'n Proto 1.0. Previous versions are not affected.

This issue is fixed in Cap'n Proto 1.0.1.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 21:21:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48299 | TorchServe ZipSlip</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48299</link><description>TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production.

A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:31:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48293 | XWiki Admin Tools Application CSRF with QueryOnXWiki allows arbitrary database queries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48293</link><description>The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the administration of XWiki. Prior to version 4.5.1, a cross-site request forgery vulnerability in the query on XWiki tool allows executing arbitrary database queries on the database of the XWiki installation. Among other things, this allows modifying and deleting all data of the wiki. This could be both used to damage the wiki and to create an account with elevated privileges for the attacker, thus impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki instance. A possible attack vector are comments on the wiki, by embedding an image with wiki syntax like `[[image:path:/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/QueryOnXWiki?query=DELETE%20FROM%20xwikidoc]]`, all documents would be deleted from the database when an admin user views this comment. This has been patched in Admin Tools Application 4.5.1 by adding form token checks. Some workarounds are available. The patch can also be applied manually to the affected pages. Alternatively, if the query tool is not needed, by deleting the document `Admin.SQLToolsGroovy`, all database query tools can be deactivated.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:31:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48300 | Embed Privacy missing escaping for show_all attribute in opt-out shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48300</link><description>The `Embed Privacy` plugin for WordPress that prevents the loading of embedded external content is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `embed_privacy_opt_out` shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Version 1.8.1 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48241 | XWiki exposed whole content of all documents of all wikis to anybody with view right on Solr suggest service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48241</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6RC1, the Solr-based search suggestion provider that also duplicates as generic JavaScript API for search results in XWiki exposes the content of all documents of all wikis to anybody who has access to it, by default it is public. This exposes all information stored in the wiki (but not some protected information like password hashes). While there is a right check normally, the right check can be circumvented by explicitly requesting fields from Solr that don't include the data for the right check. This has been fixed in XWiki 15.6RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be checked. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48292 | XWiki Admin Tools Application Run Shell Command allows CSRF RCE attacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48292</link><description>The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the administration of XWiki. Starting in version 4.4 and prior to version 4.5.1, a cross site request forgery vulnerability in the admin tool for executing shell commands on the server allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by tricking an admin into loading the URL with the shell command. A very simple possibility for an attack are comments. When the attacker can leave a comment on any page in the wiki it is sufficient to include an image with an URL like  `/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/RunShellCommand?command=touch%20/tmp/attacked` in the comment. When an admin views the comment, the file `/tmp/attacked` will be created on the server. The output of the command is also vulnerable to XWiki syntax injection which offers a simple way to execute Groovy in the context of the XWiki installation and thus an even easier way to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched by adding a form token check in version 4.5.1 of the admin tools. Some workarounds are available. The patch can be applied manually to the affected wiki pages. Alternatively, the document `Admin.RunShellCommand` can also be deleted if the possibility to run shell commands isn't needed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 18:31:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48240 | XWiki Platform sends cookies to external images in rendered diff and is vulnerable to server side request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48240</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

These requests are also sent for images from other domains and include all cookies that were sent in the original request to ensure that images with restricted view right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal login and session cookies that allow impersonating the current user who views the diff. The attack can be triggered with an image that references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger. Apart from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request forgery (the result of any successful request is returned in the image's source) and viewing protected content as once a resource is cached, it is returned for all users. As only successful requests are cached, the cache will be filled by the first user who is allowed to access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.1 and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted domains. Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the same the requested domain. The cache has been changed to be specific for each user. As a workaround, the image embedding feature can be disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-&lt;version&gt;.jar` in `WEB-INF/lib/`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:53:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48223 | fast-jwt JWT Algorithm Confusion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48223</link><description>fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to version 3.3.2, the fast-jwt library does not properly prevent JWT algorithm confusion for all public key types. The 'publicKeyPemMatcher' in 'fast-jwt/src/crypto.js' does not properly match all common PEM formats for public keys. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work if the victim application utilizes a public key containing the `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header. Applications using the RS256 algorithm, a public key with a `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header, and calling the verify function without explicitly providing an algorithm, are vulnerable to this algorithm confusion attack which allows attackers to sign arbitrary payloads which will be accepted by the verifier. Version 3.3.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change line 29 of `blob/master/src/crypto.js` to include a regular expression.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:53:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48221 | wire-avs remote format string vulnerability </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48221</link><description>wire-avs provides Audio, Visual, and Signaling (AVS) functionality sure the secure messaging software Wire.

In 
LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill 
up the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated 
Derby installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute 
malware which was visible to and executable by the account which booted 
the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also 
protected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could 
also let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive 
database functions and procedures.

Mitigation:

Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.

Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions should 
build their own Derby distribution from one of the release families to 
which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the 
releases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, 
and 8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:53:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46302 | Apache Submarine: Fix CVE-2022-1471 SnakeYaml unsafe deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46302</link><description>Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .

Apache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to
handle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines
a YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming
YAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method
is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.
 
We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.
This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.
If using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:53:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-3379 | WAGO: Improper Privilege Management in web-based management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3379</link><description>Wago web-based management of multiple products has a vulnerability which allows an local authenticated attacker  to change the passwords of other non-admin users and thus to escalate non-root privileges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 07:31:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46700 | SQL injection vulnerability in LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL version) and LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4L (SQLite version) ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46700</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL version) and LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4L (SQLite version) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary SQL command by sending a crafted request, and obtain or alter information stored in the database.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 04:52:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47175 | Cross-site scripting vulnerability in LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL version) and LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4L (SQLite ve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47175</link><description>Cross-site scripting vulnerability in LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL version) and LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4L (SQLite version) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary script on the web browser of the user who is accessing the product.</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 04:52:23 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
