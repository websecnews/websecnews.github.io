This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with a file upload action, and doesn't affect sites with PHP version &gt; 8. This vulnerability also requires the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. We confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary file deletion possible when installed with this plugin. Given Contact Form 7 is a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this plugin and the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension enabled is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 03:14:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12223 | Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Nutanix Prism Central</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12223</link><description>Prism Central versions prior to 2024.3.1 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting attack via the Events component, allowing an attacker to hijack a victim user’s session and perform actions in their security context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9132 | Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a cr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9132</link><description>Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

mm: fix a UAF when vma-&gt;mm is freed after vma-&gt;vm_refcnt got dropped

By inducing delays in the right places, Jann Horn created a reproducer for
a hard to hit UAF issue that became possible after VMAs were allowed to be
recycled by adding SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU to their cache.

Race description is borrowed from Jann's discovery report:
lock_vma_under_rcu() looks up a VMA locklessly with mas_walk() under
rcu_read_lock().  At that point, the VMA may be concurrently freed, and it
can be recycled by another process.  vma_start_read() then increments the
vma-&gt;vm_refcnt (if it is in an acceptable range), and if this succeeds,
vma_start_read() can return a recycled VMA.

In this scenario where the VMA has been recycled, lock_vma_under_rcu()
will then detect the mismatching -&gt;vm_mm pointer and drop the VMA through
vma_end_read(), which calls vma_refcount_put().  vma_refcount_put() drops
the refcount and then calls rcuwait_wake_up() using a copy of vma-&gt;vm_mm. 
This is wrong: It implicitly assumes that the caller is keeping the VMA's
mm alive, but in this scenario the caller has no relation to the VMA's mm,
so the rcuwait_wake_up() can cause UAF.

The diagram depicting the race:
T1         T2         T3
==         ==         ==
lock_vma_under_rcu
  mas_walk
          
                      mmap
                        
  vma_start_read
    __refcount_inc_not_zero_limited_acquire
                      munmap
                        __vma_enter_locked
                          refcount_add_not_zero
  vma_end_read
    vma_refcount_put
      __refcount_dec_and_test
                          rcuwait_wait_event
                            
      rcuwait_wake_up [UAF]

Note that rcuwait_wait_event() in T3 does not block because refcount was
already dropped by T1.  At this point T3 can exit and free the mm causing
UAF in T1.

To avoid this we move vma-&gt;vm_mm verification into vma_start_read() and
grab vma-&gt;vm_mm to stabilize it before vma_refcount_put() operation.

HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits

Testing by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a
shift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit
quantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but
there are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size
set to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because
of that.

HID: apple: validate feature-report field count to prevent NULL pointer dereference

A malicious HID device with quirk APPLE_MAGIC_BACKLIGHT can trigger a NULL
pointer dereference whilst the power feature-report is toggled and sent to
the device in apple_magic_backlight_report_set(). The power feature-report
is expected to have two data fields, but if the descriptor declares one
field then accessing field[1] and dereferencing it in
apple_magic_backlight_report_set() becomes invalid
since field[1] will be NULL.

An example of a minimal descriptor which can cause the crash is something
like the following where the report with ID 3 (power report) only
references a single 1-byte field. When hid core parses the descriptor it
will encounter the final feature tag, allocate a hid_report (all members
of field[] will be zeroed out), create field structure and populate it,
increasing the maxfield to 1. The subsequent field[1] access and
dereference causes the crash.

usb: gadget: uvc: Initialize frame-based format color matching descriptor

Fix NULL pointer crash in uvcg_framebased_make due to uninitialized color
matching descriptor for frame-based format which was added in
commit f5e7bdd34aca ("usb: gadget: uvc: Allow creating new color matching
descriptors") that added handling for uncompressed and mjpeg format.

Crash is seen when userspace configuration (via configfs) does not
explicitly define the color matching descriptor. If color_matching is not
found, config_group_find_item() returns NULL. The code then jumps to
out_put_cm, where it calls config_item_put(color_matching);. If
color_matching is NULL, this will dereference a null pointer, leading to a
crash.

perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings

The perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the
ringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports
it. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use
the same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for
the ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.

Though perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),
munmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,
which take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()
calls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to
reference count leaks.

As perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the
initial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by
resizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.

Implement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return
unconditionally -EINVAL.

That ensures that the mapping offsets and sizes cannot be changed after the
fact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still
possible as it takes the references for the new mapping and drops those of
the old mapping.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38564 | perf/core: Handle buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38564</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Handle buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()

After successful allocation of a buffer or a successful attachment to an
existing buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only into the page
table. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but
the other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The
calling code just cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().

This leaks reference counts, corrupts user-&gt;vm accounting and also results
in an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().

Cure this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the
map_range() call so that on map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be
invoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped() call.

perf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38565 | perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38565</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail

When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the
event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase
the perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as
perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another
reference count leak.

sunrpc: fix handling of server side tls alerts

Scott Mayhew discovered a security exploit in NFS over TLS in
tls_alert_recv() due to its assumption it can read data from
the msg iterator's kvec..

kTLS implementation splits TLS non-data record payload between
the control message buffer (which includes the type such as TLS
aler or TLS cipher change) and the rest of the payload (say TLS
alert's level/description) which goes into the msg payload buffer.

This patch proposes to rework how control messages are setup and
used by sock_recvmsg().

If no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and
process TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control
message, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a
kvec backed msg buffer and read in the control message such as a
TLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of
the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling
into the tls_alert_recv.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38567 | nfsd: avoid ref leak in nfsd_open_local_fh()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38567</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

One of them will fail to store (using xchg()) the file reference in

spi: cs42l43: Property entry should be a null-terminated array

The software node does not specify a count of property entries, so the
array must be null-terminated.

When unterminated, this can lead to a fault in the downstream cs35l56
amplifier driver, because the node parse walks off the end of the
array into unknown memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38574 | pptp: ensure minimal skb length in pptp_xmit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38574</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

A second class of oops is also seen when the underlying bus disappears

Refactor the EEH module to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also clean

f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage

KMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`
 and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.

The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three
fields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the
remaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior
when those fields are accessed later, especially during
extent merging.

Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38580 | ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38580</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()

In ext4_io_end_defer_completion(), check if io_end-&gt;list_vec is empty to
avoid adding an io_end that requires no conversion to the
i_rsv_conversion_list, which in turn prevents starting an unnecessary
worker. An ext4_emergency_state() check is also added to avoid attempting
to abort the journal in an emergency state.

Additionally, ext4_put_io_end_defer() is refactored to call
ext4_io_end_defer_completion() directly instead of being open-coded.
This also prevents starting an unnecessary worker when EXT4_IO_END_FAILED
is set but data_err=abort is not enabled.

This ensures that the check in ext4_put_io_end_defer() is consistent with
the check in ext4_end_bio(). Otherwise, we might add an io_end to the
i_rsv_conversion_list and then call ext4_finish_bio(), after which the
inode could be freed before ext4_end_io_rsv_work() is called, triggering
a use-after-free issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38581 | crypto: ccp - Fix crash when rebind ccp device for ccp.ko</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38581</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: Fix pd UAF once and for all

There is a race condition/UAF in padata_reorder that goes back
to the initial commit.  A reference count is taken at the start
of the process in padata_do_parallel, and released at the end in
padata_serial_worker.

This reference count is (and only is) required for padata_replace
to function correctly.  If padata_replace is never called then
there is no issue.

In the function padata_reorder which serves as the core of padata,
as soon as padata is added to queue-&gt;serial.list, and the associated
spin lock released, that padata may be processed and the reference
count on pd would go away.

Fix this by getting the next padata before the squeue-&gt;serial lock
is released.

In order to make this possible, simplify padata_reorder by only
calling it once the next padata arrives.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38585 | staging: media: atomisp: Fix stack buffer overflow in gmin_get_var_int()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38585</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: media: atomisp: Fix stack buffer overflow in gmin_get_var_int()

When gmin_get_config_var() calls efi.get_variable() and the EFI variable
is larger than the expected buffer size, two behaviors combine to create
a stack buffer overflow:

1. gmin_get_config_var() does not return the proper error code when
   efi.get_variable() fails. It returns the stale 'ret' value from
   earlier operations instead of indicating the EFI failure.

2. When efi.get_variable() returns EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, it updates
   *out_len to the required buffer size but writes no data to the output
   buffer. However, due to bug #1, gmin_get_var_int() believes the call
   succeeded.

The caller gmin_get_var_int() then performs:
- Allocates val[CFG_VAR_NAME_MAX + 1] (65 bytes) on stack
- Calls gmin_get_config_var(dev, is_gmin, var, val, &amp;amp;len) with len=64
- If EFI variable is &gt;64 bytes, efi.get_variable() sets len=required_size
- Due to bug #1, thinks call succeeded with len=required_size
- Executes val[len] = 0, writing past end of 65-byte stack buffer

This creates a stack buffer overflow when EFI variables are larger than
64 bytes. Since EFI variables can be controlled by firmware or system
configuration, this could potentially be exploited for code execution.

Fix the bug by returning proper error codes from gmin_get_config_var()
based on EFI status instead of stale 'ret' value.

The gmin_get_var_int() function is called during device initialization
for camera sensor configuration on Intel Bay Trail and Cherry Trail
platforms using the atomisp camera stack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38586 | bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38586</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary

In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog-&gt;aux-&gt;exception_boundary is set for a BPF
program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program
acting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved.
find_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx-&gt;fp_used = true;` when it sees FP
being used in any of the instructions.

For programs acting as exception boundary, ctx-&gt;fp_used remains false
even if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not
set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to
crash due to a pagefault.

Fix it by setting ctx-&gt;fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as
fp is always saved in such programs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38587 | ipv6: fix possible infinite loop in fib6_info_uses_dev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38587</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix possible infinite loop in fib6_info_uses_dev()

fib6_info_uses_dev() seems to rely on RCU without an explicit
protection.

Like the prior fix in rt6_nlmsg_size(),
we need to make sure fib6_del_route() or fib6_add_rt2node()
have not removed the anchor from the list, or we risk an infinite loop.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38588 | ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38588</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()

While testing prior patch, I was able to trigger
an infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:

list_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, &amp;amp;f6i-&gt;fib6_siblings,
			fib6_siblings) {
	rt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling-&gt;fib6_nh, &amp;amp;nexthop_len);
}

This is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()
uses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,
because they might no longer see the head of the list.

Restart the loop if f6i-&gt;fib6_nsiblings is zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38589 | neighbour: Fix null-ptr-deref in neigh_flush_dev().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38589</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

neighbour: Fix null-ptr-deref in neigh_flush_dev().

kernel test robot reported null-ptr-deref in neigh_flush_dev(). [0]

The cited commit introduced per-netdev neighbour list and converted
neigh_flush_dev() to use it instead of the global hash table.

One thing we missed is that neigh_table_clear() calls neigh_ifdown()
with NULL dev.

Let's restore the hash table iteration.

Note that IPv6 module is no longer unloadable, so neigh_table_clear()
is called only when IPv6 fails to initialise, which is unlikely to
happen.

net/mlx5e: Remove skb secpath if xfrm state is not found

Hardware returns a unique identifier for a decrypted packet's xfrm
state, this state is looked up in an xarray. However, the state might
have been freed by the time of this lookup.

Currently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented.
The secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in
sp-&gt;len becoming 0.

Subsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access
fields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)-&gt;xso.type (which dereferences
sp-&gt;xvec[sp-&gt;len - 1]) without first validating sp-&gt;len. This leads to
a crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.

This patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath
extension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware
decryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a
zero-length secpath.

bpf: Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields

The following BPF program, simplified from a syzkaller repro, causes a
kernel warning:

    r0 = *(u8 *)(r1 + 169);
    exit;

With pointer field sk being at offset 168 in __sk_buff. This access is
detected as a narrower read in bpf_skb_is_valid_access because it
doesn't match offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk). It is therefore allowed
and later proceeds to bpf_convert_ctx_access. Note that for the
"is_narrower_load" case in the convert_ctx_accesses(), the insn-&gt;off
is aligned, so the cnt may not be 0 because it matches the
offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk) in the bpf_convert_ctx_access. However,
the target_size stays 0 and the verifier errors with a kernel warning:

    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion(1)

This patch fixes that to return a proper "invalid bpf_context access
off=X size=Y" error on the load instruction.

The same issue affects multiple other fields in context structures that
allow narrow access. Some other non-affected fields (for sk_msg,
sk_lookup, and sockopt) were also changed to use bpf_ctx_range_ptr for
consistency.

Note this syzkaller crash was reported in the "Closes" link below, which
used to be about a different bug, fixed in
commit fce7bd8e385a ("bpf/verifier: Handle BPF_LOAD_ACQ instructions
in insn_def_regno()"). Because syzbot somehow confused the two bugs,
the new crash and repro didn't get reported to the mailing list.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38592 | Bluetooth: hci_devcd_dump: fix out-of-bounds via dev_coredumpv</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38592</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_devcd_dump: fix out-of-bounds via dev_coredumpv

Currently both dev_coredumpv and skb_put_data in hci_devcd_dump use
hdev-&gt;dump.head. However, dev_coredumpv can free the buffer. From
dev_coredumpm_timeout documentation, which is used by dev_coredumpv:

    &gt; Creates a new device coredump for the given device. If a previous one hasn't
    &gt; been read yet, the new coredump is discarded. The data lifetime is determined
    &gt; by the device coredump framework and when it is no longer needed the @free
    &gt; function will be called to free the data.

If the data has not been read by the userspace yet, dev_coredumpv will
discard new buffer, freeing hdev-&gt;dump.head. This leads to
vmalloc-out-of-bounds error when skb_put_data tries to access
hdev-&gt;dump.head.

A crash report from syzbot illustrates this:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix double free in 'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'

Function 'hci_discovery_filter_clear()' frees 'uuids' array and then
sets it to NULL. There is a tiny chance of the following race:

'hci_cmd_sync_work()'

 'update_passive_scan_sync()'

   'hci_update_passive_scan_sync()'

     'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'
       kfree(uuids);

       &lt;-------------------------preempted--------------------------------&gt;
                                           'start_service_discovery()'

                                             'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'
                                               kfree(uuids); // DOUBLE FREE

       &lt;-------------------------preempted--------------------------------&gt;

      uuids = NULL;

To fix it let's add locking around 'kfree()' call and NULL pointer
assignment. Otherwise the following backtrace fires:

iommu/vt-d: Fix UAF on sva unbind with pending IOPFs

Commit 17fce9d2336d ("iommu/vt-d: Put iopf enablement in domain attach

IOPF queue when the last IOPF-capable domain is detached from the device.
Unfortunately, it did this in a wrong place where there are still pending
IOPFs. As a result, a use-after-free error is potentially triggered and
eventually a kernel panic with a kernel trace similar to the following:

xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()

[dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through -
up to xen folks]

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its -&gt;release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.

Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do
fd_install() only when everything had been set up.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38596 | drm/panthor: Fix UAF in panthor_gem_create_with_handle() debugfs code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38596</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Fix UAF in panthor_gem_create_with_handle() debugfs code

The object is potentially already gone after the drm_gem_object_put().
In general the object should be fully constructed before calling
drm_gem_handle_create(), except the debugfs tracking uses a separate
lock and list and separate flag to denotate whether the object is
actually initialized.

Since I'm touching this all anyway simplify this by only adding the
object to the debugfs when it's ready for that, which allows us to
delete that separate flag. panthor_gem_debugfs_bo_rm() already checks
whether we've actually been added to the list or this is some error
path cleanup.

drm/rockchip: vop2: fail cleanly if missing a primary plane for a video-port

Each window of a vop2 is usable by a specific set of video ports, so while
binding the vop2, we look through the list of available windows trying to
find one designated as primary-plane and usable by that specific port.

The code later wants to use drm_crtc_init_with_planes with that found
primary plane, but nothing has checked so far if a primary plane was
actually found.

For whatever reason, the rk3576 vp2 does not have a usable primary window
(if vp0 is also in use) which brought the issue to light and ended in a
null-pointer dereference further down.

As we expect a primary-plane to exist for a video-port, add a check at
the end of the window-iteration and fail probing if none was found.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38598 | drm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free in amdgpu_userq_suspend+0x51a/0x5a0</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38598</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix slab-use-after-free in amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini+0x70c

The issue was reproduced on NV10 using IGT pci_unplug test.
It is expected that `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()` is called prior to `amdgpu_drm_release()`.
However, the bug is that `amdgpu_fpriv` was freed in `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()`, and then
later accessed in `amdgpu_drm_release()` via a call to `amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()`.
As a result, KASAN detected a use-after-free condition, as shown in the log below.
The proposed fix is to move the calls to `amdgpu_eviction_fence_destroy()` and
`amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()` into `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()`, so they are invoked before
`amdgpu_fpriv` is freed.

This also ensures symmetry with the initialization path in `amdgpu_driver_open_kms()`,
where the following components are initialized:
- `amdgpu_userq_mgr_init()`
- `amdgpu_eviction_fence_init()`
- `amdgpu_ctx_mgr_init()`

Correspondingly, in `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()` we should clean up using:
- `amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()`
- `amdgpu_eviction_fence_destroy()`
- `amdgpu_ctx_mgr_fini()`

This change eliminates the use-after-free and improves consistency in resource management between open and close paths.

wifi: ath12k: Avoid accessing uninitialized arvif-&gt;ar during beacon miss

During beacon miss handling, ath12k driver iterates over active virtual
interfaces (vifs) and attempts to access the radio object (ar) via
arvif-&gt;deflink-&gt;ar.

However, after commit aa80f12f3bed ("wifi: ath12k: defer vdev creation for
MLO"), arvif is linked to a radio only after vdev creation, typically when
a channel is assigned or a scan is requested.
For P2P capable devices, a default P2P interface is created by
wpa_supplicant along with regular station interfaces, these serve as dummy
interfaces for P2P-capable stations, lack an associated netdev and initiate
frequent scans to discover neighbor p2p devices. When a scan is initiated
on such P2P vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan
frequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the
scan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif
from the radio and leaving arvif-&gt;ar uninitialized.

While handling beacon miss for station interfaces, P2P interface is also
encountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()
tries to dereference the uninitialized arvif-&gt;deflink-&gt;ar.

Fix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing
its ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.

BPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently verifier.c:can_jump()

When sending plaintext data, we initially calculated the corresponding

via socket policy, we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.

This results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data during
ciphertext transmission.

This causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete

The reproducer executes the host's unlocked_ioctl call in two different

initialized when executing vmci_datagram_dispatch() to send events to all
vm contexts. This affects the datagram taken from the datagram queue of
its context by another task, because the datagram payload is not initialized
according to the size payload_size, which causes the kernel data to leak
to the user space.

Before dispatching the datagram, and before setting the payload content,

Ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
EP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.

Currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - They don't look upwards in the tree.
 - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths").

Essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

A more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

As a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,
tested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 ("eventpoll: Fix priority inversion
problem").)

To fix it:

1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38615 | fs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38615</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails

The reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link.
When renaming, the file0's inode is marked as a bad inode because the file
name cannot be deleted.

The underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode.
In some cases it's "icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias()
is called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call
make_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache, but we'd already
found it there earlier".
In some it's outright "we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we
got it in the first place; let's call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits
and giggles".</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:15:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54881 | Mermaid improperly sanitizes of sequence diagram labels leading to XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54881</link><description>Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

This issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.



When using the API Ognl.getValue​, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods,
 etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. 
Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

From 7.1.0 to before 9.9.1, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the --UNSAFE,--trust flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination path where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering a generated directory structure whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path. Constructing such paths is possible using Copier's builtin pathjoin Jinja filter and its builtin _copier_conf.sep variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55201 | Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read/write access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55201</link><description>Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates.
