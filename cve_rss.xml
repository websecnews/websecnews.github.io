Versions 2.3.2 and above are vulnerable to symlink-following when running in privileged contexts. A token-group user can redirect file operations to arbitrary filesystem targets by planting symlinks in group-writable token directories, resulting in privilege escalation or data exposure. Token and lock directories are 0770 (group-writable for token users), so any token-group member can plant files and symlinks inside them. When run as root, the base code handling token directory file access, as well as several openCryptoki tools used for administrative purposes, may reset ownership or permissions on existing files inside the token directories. An attacker with token-group membership can exploit the system when an administrator runs a PKCS#11 application or administrative tool that performs chown on files inside the token directory during normal maintenance. This issue is fixed in commit 5e6e4b4, but has not been included in a released version at the time of publication.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:47:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23946 | Tendenci has Authenticated Remote Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23946</link><description>Tendenci is an open source content management system built for non-profits, associations and cause-based sites. Versions 15.3.11 and below include a critical deserialization vulnerability in the Helpdesk module (which is not enabled by default). This vulnerability allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) by an authenticated user with staff security level due to using Python's pickle module in helpdesk /reports/. The original CVE-2020-14942 was incompletely patched. While ticket_list() was fixed to use safe JSON deserialization, the run_report() function still uses unsafe pickle.loads(). The impact is limited to the permissions of the user running the application, typically www-data, which generally lacks write (except for upload directories) and execute permissions. This issue has been fixed in version 15.3.12.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:47:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23951 | SumatraPDF&amp;#x27;s Integer Underflow in PalmDbReader Leads to Crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23951</link><description>SumatraPDF is a multi-format reader for Windows.

In versions 6.8.148 and below, and 25.0.1 through 25.0.79, the application stores unsanitized filenames in the database, which can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Users who interact with these specially crafted file names within the Group-Office application are affected. While the scope is limited to the file-viewing context, it could still be used to interfere with user sessions or perform unintended actions in the browser. This issue is fixed in versions 6.8.149 and 25.0.80.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:52:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1036 | Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery &amp;lt;= 1.8.36 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Comment Deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1036</link><description>The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the delete_comment() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.36.

All versions are vulnerable to CSV Injection (Formula Injection) through the contest rank export functionality (contestrank.xls.php and admin/ranklist_export.php). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the "Nickname" field) before exporting it to an .xls file (which renders as an HTML table but is opened by Excel). If a malicious user sets their nickname to an Excel formula when an administrator exports and opens the rank list in Microsoft Excel, the formula will be executed. This can lead to arbitrary command execution (RCE) on the administrator's machine or data exfiltration. A fix was not available at the time of publication.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:52:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23736 | seroval Affected by Prototype Pollution via JSON Deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23736</link><description>seroval facilitates JS value stringification, including complex structures beyond JSON.stringify capabilities.

In versions 1.4.0 and below, improper input handling in the JSON deserialization component can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution. Exploitation is possible via overriding constant value and error deserialization, allowing indirect access to unsafe JS evaluation. At minimum, attackers need the ability to perform 4 separate requests on the same function, and partial knowledge of how the serialized data is used during later runtime processing. This vulnerability affects the fromJSON and fromCrossJSON functions in a client-to-server transmission scenario. This issue has been fixed in version 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:35:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23630 | Docmost is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Mermaid rendering</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23630</link><description>Docmost is open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software. In versions 0.3.0 through 0.23.2, Mermaid code block rendering is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The frontend can render attacker-controlled Mermaid diagrams using mermaid.render(), then inject the returned SVG/HTML into the DOM via dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization. Mermaid per-diagram %%{init}%% directives allow overriding securityLevel and enabling htmlLabels, permitting arbitrary HTML/JS execution for any viewer. This issue has been fixed in version 0.24.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:02:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24048 | Backstage has a Possible SSRF when reading from allowed URL&amp;#x27;s in `backend.reading.allow`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24048</link><description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/backend-defaults provides the default implementations and setup for a standard Backstage backend app. Prior to versions 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0, the `FetchUrlReader` component, used by the catalog and other plugins to fetch content from URLs, followed HTTP redirects automatically. This allowed an attacker who controls a host listed in `backend.reading.allow` to redirect requests to internal or sensitive URLs that are not on the allowlist, bypassing the URL allowlist security control. This is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could allow access to internal resources, but it does not allow attackers to include additional request headers. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-defaults` version 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later. Some workarounds are available. Restrict `backend.reading.allow` to only trusted hosts that you control and that do not issue redirects, ensure allowed hosts do not have open redirect vulnerabilities, and/or use network-level controls to block access from Backstage to sensitive internal endpoints.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:02:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24047 | @backstage/cli-common has a possible `resolveSafeChildPath` Symlink Chain Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24047</link><description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/cli-common provides config loading functionality used by the backend and command line interface of Backstage. Prior to version 0.1.17, the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility function in `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`, which is used to prevent path traversal attacks, failed to properly validate symlink chains and dangling symlinks. An attacker could bypass the path validation via symlink chains (creating `link1 → link2 → /outside` where intermediate symlinks eventually resolve outside the allowed directory) and dangling symlinks (creating symlinks pointing to non-existent paths outside the base directory, which would later be created during file operations). This function is used by Scaffolder actions and other backend components to ensure file operations stay within designated directories. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-plugin-api` version 0.1.17. Users should upgrade to this version or later. Some workarounds are available. Run Backstage in a containerized environment with limited filesystem access and/or restrict template creation to trusted users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:02:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23990 | Flux Operator Web UI Impersonation Bypass via Empty OIDC Claims</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23990</link><description>The Flux Operator is a Kubernetes CRD controller that manages the lifecycle of CNCF Flux CD and the ControlPlane enterprise distribution. Starting in version 0.36.0 and prior to version 0.40.0, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Flux Operator Web UI authentication code that allows an attacker to bypass Kubernetes RBAC impersonation and execute API requests with the operator's service account privileges. In order to be vulnerable, cluster admins must configure the Flux Operator with an OIDC provider that issues tokens lacking the expected claims (e.g., `email`, `groups`), or configure custom CEL expressions that can evaluate to empty values. After OIDC token claims are processed through CEL expressions, there is no validation that the resulting `username` and `groups` values are non-empty. When both values are empty, the Kubernetes client-go library does not add impersonation headers to API requests, causing them to be executed with the flux-operator service account's credentials instead of the authenticated user's limited permissions. This can result in privilege escalation, data exposure, and/or information disclosure. Version 0.40.0 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23996 | FastAPI Api Key has a timing side-channel in verify_key that allows statistical key validity detection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23996</link><description>FastAPI Api Key provides a backend-agnostic library that provides an API key system. Version 1.1.0 has a timing side-channel vulnerability in verify_key(). The method applied a random delay only on verification failures, allowing an attacker to statistically distinguish valid from invalid API keys by measuring response latencies. With enough repeated requests, an adversary could infer whether a key_id corresponds to a valid key, potentially accelerating brute-force or enumeration attacks. All users relying on verify_key() for API key authentication prior to the fix are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. The patch applies a uniform random delay (min_delay to max_delay) to all responses regardless of outcome, eliminating the timing correlation. Some workarounds are available. Add an application-level fixed delay or random jitter to all authentication responses (success and failure) before the fix is applied and/or use rate limiting to reduce the feasibility of statistical timing attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24046 | Backstage has a Possible Symlink Path Traversal in Scaffolder Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24046</link><description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. Multiple Scaffolder actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable to symlink-based path traversal attacks. An attacker with access to create and execute Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks to read arbitrary files via the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets); delete arbitrary files via the `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace, and write files outside the workspace via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious symlinks. This affects any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute Scaffolder templates. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-defaults` versions 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0; `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` versions 2.2.2, 3.0.2, and 3.1.1; and `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` versions 0.11.2 and 0.12.3. Users should upgrade to these versions or later. Some workarounds are available. Follow the recommendation in the Backstage Threat Model to limit access to creating and updating templates, restrict who can create and execute Scaffolder templates using the permissions framework, audit existing templates for symlink usage, and/or run Backstage in a containerized environment with limited filesystem access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23968 | Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read access via symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: false</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23968</link><description>Copier is a library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to version 9.11.2, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently include arbitrary files/directories outside the local template clone location by using symlinks along with `_preserve_symlinks: false` (which is Copier's default setting). Version 9.11.2 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23986 | Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem write access via directory symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: true</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23986</link><description>Copier is a library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to version 9.11.2, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with `_preserve_symlinks: true` and a generated directory structure whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. Version 9.11.2 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:47:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23524 | Laravel Redis Horizontal Scaling Insecure Deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23524</link><description>Laravel Reverb provides a real-time WebSocket communication backend for Laravel applications. In versions 1.6.3 and below, Reverb passes data from the Redis channel directly into PHP’s unserialize() function without restricting which classes can be instantiated, which leaves users vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The exploitability of this vulnerability is increased because Redis servers are commonly deployed without authentication, but only affects Laravel Reverb when horizontal scaling is enabled (REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true). This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0. As a workaround, require a strong password for Redis access and ensure the service is only accessible via a private network or local loopback, and/or set REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=false to bypass the vulnerable logic entirely (if the environment uses only one Reverb node).</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:15:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23960 | Argo Workflows affected by stored XSS in the artifact directory listing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23960</link><description>Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.

A broken access control issue in versions prior to 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 allowed authenticated users to access debug and profiling endpoints regardless of role. As a result, low-privilege users could view internal server diagnostics and trigger resource-intensive profiling operations. Fleet’s debug/pprof endpoints are accessible to any authenticated user regardless of role, including the lowest-privilege “Observer” role. This allows low-privilege users to access sensitive server internals, including runtime profiling data and in-memory application state, and to trigger CPU-intensive profiling operations that could lead to denial of service. Versions 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 fix the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, users should put the debug/pprof endpoints behind an IP allowlist as a workaround.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:53:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23518 | Fleet has a JWT signature bypass vulnerability in Azure AD MDM enrollment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23518</link><description>Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3, a vulnerability in Fleet's Windows MDM enrollment flow could allow an attacker to submit forged authentication tokens that are not properly validated. Because JWT signatures were not verified, Fleet could accept attacker-controlled identity claims, enabling enrollment of unauthorized devices under arbitrary Azure AD user identities. Versions 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 fix the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected Fleet users should temporarily disable Windows MDM.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:53:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23526 | CVAT vulnerable to privilege escalation of users with staff status</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23526</link><description>CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.

Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.20.108, 3.21.43, and 3.22.27, Saleor allowed authenticated staff users or Apps to upload arbitrary files, including malicious HTML and SVG files containing Javascript. Depending on the deployment strategy, these files may be served from the same domain as the dashboard without any restrictions leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser. Malicious staff members could craft script injections to target other staff members, possibly stealing their access and/or refresh tokens. Users are vulnerable if they host the media files inside the same domain as the dashboard, e.g., dashboard is at `example.com/dashboard/` and media are under `example.com/media/`. They are not impact if media files are hosted in a different domain, e.g., `media.example.com`. Users are impacted if they do not return a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header for the media files. Saleor Cloud users are not impacted. This issue has been patched in versions: 3.22.27, 3.21.43, and 3.20.108. Some workarounds are available for those unable to upgrade. Configure the servers hosting the media files (e.g., CDN or reverse proxy) to return the Content-Disposition: attachment header. This instructs browsers to download the file instead of rendering them in the browser. Prevent the servers from returning HTML and SVG files. Set-up a `Content-Security-Policy` for media files, such as `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none';`.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:53:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23516 | CVAT vulnerable to XSS via skeleton SVG images</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23516</link><description>CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.8.7 allows an attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow when converting floating-point values to strings with high precision. By passing very large `decimalPlaces` values to the affected String constructors or concat methods, the `dtostrf` function writes beyond fixed-size stack buffers, causing memory corruption and denial of service. Under specific conditions, this could enable arbitrary code execution on AVR-based Arduino boards.

Prior to version 2025.9.0, once the validity of the received V2G message has been verified, it is checked whether the submitted session ID matches the registered one. However, if no session has been registered, the default value is 0. Therefore, a message submitted with a session ID of 0 is accepted, as it matches the registered value. This could allow unauthorized and anonymous indirect emission of MQTT messages and communication with V2G messages handlers, updating a session context. Version 2025.9.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:58:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12781 | base64.b64decode() always accepts &amp;quot;+/&amp;quot; characters, despite setting altchars</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12781</link><description>When passing data to the b64decode(), standard_b64decode(), and urlsafe_b64decode() functions in the "base64" module the characters "+/" will always be accepted, regardless of the value of "altchars" parameter, typically used to establish an "alternative base64 alphabet" such as the URL safe alphabet. This behavior matches what is recommended in earlier base64 RFCs, but newer RFCs now recommend either dropping characters outside the specified base64 alphabet or raising an error. The old behavior has the possibility of causing data integrity issues.




This behavior can only be insecure if your application uses an alternate base64 alphabet (without "+/"). If your application does not use the "altchars" parameter or the urlsafe_b64decode() function, then your application does not use an alternative base64 alphabet.




The attached patches DOES NOT make the base64-decode behavior raise an error, as this would be a change in behavior and break existing programs. Instead, the patch deprecates the behavior which will be replaced with the newly recommended behavior in a future version of Python. Users are recommended to mitigate by verifying user-controlled inputs match the base64 
alphabet they are expecting or verify that their application would not be 
affected if the b64decode() functions accepted "+" or "/" outside of altchars.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:58:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68138 | EVerest affected by memory exhaustion in libocpp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68138</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack, and EVerest libocpp is a C++ implementation of the Open Charge Point Protocol. In libocpp prior to version 0.30.1, pointers returned by the `strdup` calls are never freed.

In all versions up to and including 2025.12.1, the default value for `terminate_connection_on_failed_response` is `False`, which leaves the responsibility for session and connection termination to the EV. In this configuration, any errors encountered by the module are logged but do not trigger countermeasures such as session and connection reset or termination. This could be abused by a malicious user in order to exploit other weaknesses or vulnerabilities. While the default will stay at the setting that is described as potentially problematic in this reported issue, a mitigation is available by changing the `terminate_connection_on_failed_response`  setting to `true`. However this cannot be set to this value by default since it can trigger errors in vehicle ECUs requiring ECU resets and lengthy unavailability in charging for vehicles. The maintainers judge this to be a much more important workaround then short-term unavailability of an EVSE, therefore this setting will stay at the current value.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:58:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68136 | EVerest&amp;#x27;s inadequate session handling can lead to memory-related errors or exhaustion of the operating system’s file descriptors, resulting in a denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68136</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack.

Previous `Session` is not saved and the usage of an `unique_ptr` is lost, destroying connection data.

Prior to version 2025.10.0, an integer overflow occurring in `SdpPacket::parse_header()` allows the current buffer length to be set to 7 after a complete header of size 8 has been read. The remaining length to read is computed using the current length subtracted by the header length which results in a negative value. This value is then interpreted as `SIZE_MAX` (or slightly less) because the expected type of the argument is `size_t`. Depending on whether the server is plain TCP or TLS, this leads to either an infinite loop or a stack buffer overflow.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain user-level access to the underlying operating system and then elevate privileges to root.
Note: Cisco has assigned this security advisory a Security Impact Rating (SIR) of Critical rather than High as the score indicates. The reason is that exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker elevating privileges to root.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:42:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20055 | Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise &amp;amp; Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20055</link><description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.&amp;nbsp;

These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SSH service to be unresponsive during the period of the DoS attack. All other operations remain stable during the attack.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:42:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20092 | Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20092</link><description>A vulnerability in the read-only maintenance shell of Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative privileges to elevate privileges to root on the virtual appliance.

  *  Use of Solr's "RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin config (see security.json) that specifies multiple "roles"
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list (see security.json) that uses one or more of the following pre-defined permission rules: "config-read", "config-edit", "schema-read", "metrics-read", or "security-read".
  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list that doesn't define the "all" pre-defined permission
  *  A networking setup that allows clients to make unfiltered network requests to Solr. (i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)

Users can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the "all" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an "admin" or other privileged role.  Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22444 | Apache Solr: Insufficient file-access checking in standalone core-creation requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22444</link><description>The "create core" API of Apache Solr 8.6 through 9.10.0 lacks sufficient input validation on some API parameters, which can cause Solr to check the existence of and attempt to read file-system paths that should be disallowed by Solr's  "allowPaths" security setting https://https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuring-solr-xml.html#the-solr-element .  These read-only accesses can allow users to create cores using unexpected configsets if any are accessible via the filesystem.  On Windows systems configured to allow UNC paths this can additionally cause disclosure of NTLM "user" hashes. 

Solr deployments are subject to this vulnerability if they meet the following criteria:
  *  Solr is running in its "standalone" mode.
  *  Solr's "allowPath" setting is being used to restrict file access to certain directories.
  *  Solr's "create core" API is exposed and accessible to untrusted users.  This can happen if Solr's  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/rule-based-authorization-plugin.html  is disabled, or if it is enabled but the "core-admin-edit" predefined permission (or an equivalent custom permission) is given to low-trust (i.e. non-admin) user roles.

Users can mitigate this by enabling Solr's RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (if disabled) and configuring a permission-list that prevents untrusted users from creating new Solr cores.  Users should also upgrade to Apache Solr 9.10.1 or greater, which contain fixes for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:55:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22977 | net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22977</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue

skbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,
[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.
[2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is
enabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace
via sock_recv_errqueue() -&gt; put_cmsg().

The crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()
   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]
2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone
[3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp
reporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE)
5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr-&gt;ee from skb-&gt;cb
[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no
   usercopy whitelist [5]

When cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the
socket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb-&gt;cb
via put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:

The crash offset 296 corresponds to skb2-&gt;cb within skbuff_fclones:
  - sizeof(struct sk_buff) = 232 - offsetof(struct sk_buff, cb) = 40 -
  offset of skb2.cb in fclones = 232 + 40 = 272 - crash offset 296 =
  272 + 24 (inside sock_exterr_skb.ee)

This patch uses a local stack variable as a bounce buffer to avoid the hardened usercopy check failure.

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset

`qfq_class-&gt;leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0` does not imply that the class
itself is active.

Two qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens
when:

1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and

2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get()
/ qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function
tc_new_tfilter.

When packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared
leaf_qdisc-&gt;q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ
qdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters
qfq_reset() with its own q-&gt;q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf
qdisc-&gt;q.qlen &gt; 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate
an inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:

This vulnerability allows the issuance of access and refresh tokens for disabled users, leading to unauthorized use of previously revoked privileges, via a business logic vulnerability in the Token Exchange implementation when a privileged client invokes the token exchange flow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:23:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1035 | Org.keycloak.protocol.oidc: keycloak refresh token reuse bypass via toctou race condition</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1035</link><description>A flaw was found in the Keycloak server during refresh token processing, specifically in the TokenManager class responsible for enforcing refresh token reuse policies. When strict refresh token rotation is enabled, the validation and update of refresh token usage are not performed atomically. This allows concurrent refresh requests to bypass single-use enforcement and issue multiple access tokens from the same refresh token. As a result, Keycloak’s refresh token rotation hardening can be undermined.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:23:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68133 | EVerest&amp;#x27;s unlimited connections can lead to DoS through operating system resource exhaustion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68133</link><description>EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In versions 2025.9.0 and below, an attacker can exhaust the operating system's memory and cause the module to terminate by initiating an unlimited number of TCP connections that never proceed to ISO 15118-2 communication. This is possible because a new thread is started for each incoming plain TCP or TLS socket connection before any verification occurs, and the verification performed is too permissive. The EVerest processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE functionality. This issue is fixed in version 2025.10.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:10:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15521 | Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution &amp;lt;= 3.5.0 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15521</link><description>The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password and relying solely on a publicly-exposed nonce for authorization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's password, including administrators, and gain access to their account.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:10:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0933 | OS Command Injection in `wrangler pages deploy`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0933</link><description>SummaryA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.




Root causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g.,  execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.




ImpactThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the 

--commit-hash parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:

  *  Run any shell command.
  *  Exfiltrate environment variables.
  *  Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.



Credits Disclosed responsibly by kny4hacker.




Mitigation
  *  Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.
  *  Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.
  *  Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a supported major version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:58:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21922 | No english

By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files. This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, leading to potential system compromise.
This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55131 | A flaw in Node.js's buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations are interrupted, when using the `vm` module wit...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55131</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations are interrupted, when using the `vm` module with the timeout option. Under specific timing conditions, buffers allocated with `Buffer.alloc` and other `TypedArray` instances like `Uint8Array` may contain leftover data from previous operations, allowing in-process secrets like tokens or passwords to leak or causing data corruption. While exploitation typically requires precise timing or in-process code execution, it can become remotely exploitable when untrusted input influences workload and timeouts, leading to potential confidentiality and integrity impact.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55132 | A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55132</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process has only read permissions. Unlike `utimes()`, `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks, which means file metadata can be modified in read-only directories. This behavior could be used to alter timestamps in ways that obscure activity, reducing the reliability of logs. This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59464 | A memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buff...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59464</link><description>A memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buffer. When applications call `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)`, each certificate field leaks memory, allowing remote clients to trigger steady memory growth through repeated TLS connections. Over time this can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59465 | A malformed `HTTP/2 HEADERS` frame with oversized, invalid `HPACK` data can cause Node.js to crash by triggering an unhandled `TLSSocket` er...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59465</link><description>A malformed `HTTP/2 HEADERS` frame with oversized, invalid `HPACK` data can cause Node.js to crash by triggering an unhandled `TLSSocket` error `ECONNRESET`. Instead of safely closing the connection, the process crashes, enabling a remote denial of service. This primarily affects applications that do not attach explicit error handlers to secure sockets, for example:
```
server.on('secureConnection', socket =&gt; {
  socket.on('error', err =&gt; {
    console.log(err)
  })
})

Instead of reaching `process.on('uncaughtException')`, the process terminates, making the crash unrecoverable. Applications that rely on `AsyncLocalStorage` (v22, v20) or `async_hooks.createHook()` (v24, v22, v20) become vulnerable to denial-of-service crashes triggered by deep recursion under specific conditions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21636 | A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21636</link><description>A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabled. Even without `--allow-net`, attacker-controlled inputs (such as URLs or socketPath options) can connect to arbitrary local sockets via net, tls, or undici/fetch. This breaks the intended security boundary of the permission model and enables access to privileged local services, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exposure, or local code execution.

* The issue affects users of the Node.js permission model on version v25.

In the moment of this vulnerability, network permissions (`--allow-net`) are still in the experimental phase.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21637 | A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallba...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21637</link><description>A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallback` are in use. Synchronous exceptions thrown during these callbacks bypass standard TLS error handling paths (tlsClientError and error), causing either immediate process termination or silent file descriptor leaks that eventually lead to denial of service. Because these callbacks process attacker-controlled input during the TLS handshake, a remote client can repeatedly trigger the issue. This vulnerability affects TLS servers using PSK or ALPN callbacks across Node.js versions where these callbacks throw without being safely wrapped.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66692 | A buffer over-read in the PublicKey::verify() method of Binance - Trust Wallet Core before commit 5668c67 allows attackers to cause a Denial...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66692</link><description>A buffer over-read in the PublicKey::verify() method of Binance - Trust Wallet Core before commit 5668c67 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66902 | An input validation issue in in Pithikos websocket-server v.0.6.4 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause unexpect...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66902</link><description>An input validation issue in in Pithikos websocket-server v.0.6.4 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause unexpected server behavior via the websocket_server/websocket_server.py, WebSocketServer._message_received components.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0622 | Open 5GS WebUI uses a hard-coded JWT signing key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0622</link><description>Open 5GS WebUI uses a hard-coded JWT signing key (change-me) whenever the environment variable JWT_SECRET_KEY is unset</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1245 | CVE-2026-1245</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1245</link><description>A code injection vulnerability in the binary-parser library prior to version 2.3.0 allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution when untrusted values are used in parser field names or encoding parameters.

An attacker can exploit this by sending repeated subscription requests with arbitrarily large or invalid filter payloads. Each request causes memory to be allocated for the malformed topic filter, but the broker does not free the associated memory, leading to unbounded heap growth and potential denial of service under sustained attack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36115 | Multiple vulnerabilities were addressed in IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36115</link><description>IBM Sterling Connect:Express Adapter for Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2.0.00 through 5.2.0.12 does not disallow the session id after use which could allow an authenticated user to impersonate another user on the system.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:56:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36396 | Security vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Application Gateway</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36396</link><description>IBM Application Gateway 23.10 through 25.09 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

This is due to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations` system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. This is a Race Condition which enables Arbitrary File Overwrite. This vulnerability affects users and systems using node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+). Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. The patch in version 7.5.4 updates `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')` and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`. As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:21:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1195 | MineAdmin JWT Token refresh data authenticity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1195</link><description>A weakness has been identified in MineAdmin 1.x/2.x.

The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`.
