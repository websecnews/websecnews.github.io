Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments.

The heifsave operation could incorrectly determine the presence of an alpha channel in an input when it was not possible to determine the colour interpretation, known internally within libvips as "multiband". There aren't many ways to create a "multiband" input, but it is possible with a well-crafted TIFF image. If a "multiband" TIFF input image had 4 channels and HEIF-based output was requested, this led to libvips creating a 3 channel HEIF image without an alpha channel but then attempting to write 4 channels of data. This caused a heap buffer overflow, which could crash the process. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.16.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:26:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3382 | joey-zhou xiaozhi-esp32-server-java update sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3382</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in joey-zhou xiaozhi-esp32-server-java up to a14fe8115842ee42ab5c7a51706b8a85db5200b7 and classified as critical.

Specifically, the app’s code is not obfuscated, and no measures are in place to protect against decompilation, disassembly, or debugging. As a result, attackers can reverse-engineer the application to gain insights into its internal workings, which can potentially lead to the discovery of sensitive information, business logic flaws, and other vulnerabilities.
Utilizing this flaw, the attacker was able to identify the Hardcoded credentials from PortalUsersDatabase.dll, which contains .NET remoting definition. Inside the namespace PortalUsersDatabase, the class Users contains the functions CreateAdmin and CreateService that are used to initialize accounts in the Portal service. Both CreateAdmin and CreateService functions contain a hardcoded encrypted password along with its respective salt that are set with the function SetInitialPasswordAndSalt.

A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert(). Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32014 | estree-util-value-to-estree allows prototype pollution in generated ESTree</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32014</link><description>estree-util-value-to-estree converts a JavaScript value to an ESTree expression.

A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (width and height) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like 100%;height:100%;position:fixed;, potentially covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate content, trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking), or disrupt the intended functionality and accessibility of the website. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31475 | tarteaucitron.js allows prototype pollution via custom text injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31475</link><description>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where the addOrUpdate function, used for applying custom texts, did not properly validate input. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to modify object prototypes, affecting core JavaScript behavior, cause application crashes or unexpected behavior, or potentially introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30373 | Graylog Authenticated HTTP inputs do ingest message even if Authorization header is missing or has wrong value</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30373</link><description>Graylog is a free and open log management platform.

Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions &gt;= 2.4.16.11.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:18:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32013 | Server-Side Request Forgery via LNURL Authentication Callback in LNbits Lightning Network Payment System</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32013</link><description>LNbits is a Lightning wallet and accounts system. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability has been discovered in LNbits' LNURL authentication handling functionality. When processing LNURL authentication requests, the application accepts a callback URL parameter and makes an HTTP request to that URL using the httpx library with redirect following enabled. The application doesn't properly validate the callback URL, allowing attackers to specify internal network addresses and access internal resources.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:18:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31488 | Plain Craft Launcher&amp;#x27;s custom homepage can use Internet Explorer to load web pages with the help of controls such as WebBrowser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31488</link><description>Plain Craft Launcher (PCL) is a launcher for Minecraft.
