A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NASA CryptoLib version 1.4.0 and prior in the IV setup logic for telecommand frames. The problem arises from missing bounds checks when copying the Initialization Vector (IV) into a freshly allocated buffer. An attacker can supply a crafted TC frame that causes the library to write one byte past the end of the heap buffer, leading to heap corruption and undefined behaviour. An attacker supplying a malformed telecommand frame can corrupt heap memory. This leads to undefined behaviour, which could manifest itself as a crash (denial of service) or more severe exploitation. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:46:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40920 | Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP versions 1.018 and earlier for Perl use insecurely generated nonces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40920</link><description>Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP versions 1.018 and earlier for Perl generate nonces using the Perl Data::UUID library.  *  Data::UUID does not use a strong cryptographic source for generating UUIDs.

clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns

What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something
hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  "Wouldn't be able to undo"
may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from
lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.

clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.

There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various
userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve
different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,
but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:16:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45146 | ModelCache for LLM through v0.2.0 was discovered to contain an deserialization vulnerability via the component /manager/data_manager.py.

granted by the user to the main application bundle. An attacker with local user access can
invoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts, leveraging the
application's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of GIMP, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent.

This issue has been fixed in 3.1.4.2 version of GIMP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:12:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8845 | NASM Netwide Assember nasm.c assemble_file stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8845</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in NASM Netwide Assember 2.17rc0.
