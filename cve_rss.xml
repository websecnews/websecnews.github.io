md: suspend array while updating raid_disks via sysfs

In raid1_reshape(), freeze_array() is called before modifying the r1bio
memory pool (conf-&gt;r1bio_pool) and conf-&gt;raid_disks, and
unfreeze_array() is called after the update is completed.

However, freeze_array() only waits until nr_sync_pending and
(nr_pending - nr_queued) of all buckets reaches zero. When an I/O error
occurs, nr_queued is increased and the corresponding r1bio is queued to
either retry_list or bio_end_io_list. As a result, freeze_array() may
unblock before these r1bios are released.

This can lead to a situation where conf-&gt;raid_disks and the mempool have
already been updated while queued r1bios, allocated with the old
raid_disks value, are later released. Consequently, free_r1bio() may
access memory out of bounds in put_all_bios() and release r1bios of the
wrong size to the new mempool, potentially causing issues with the
mempool as well.

Since only normal I/O might increase nr_queued while an I/O error occurs,
suspending the array avoids this issue.

Note: Updating raid_disks via ioctl SET_ARRAY_INFO already suspends
the array. Therefore, we suspend the array when updating raid_disks
via sysfs to avoid this issue too.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71226 | wifi: iwlwifi: Implement settime64 as stub for MVM/MLD PTP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71226</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: Implement settime64 as stub for MVM/MLD PTP

Since commit dfb073d32cac ("ptp: Return -EINVAL on ptp_clock_register if
required ops are NULL"), PTP clock registered through ptp_clock_register
is required to have ptp_clock_info.settime64 set, however, neither MVM
nor MLD's PTP clock implementation sets it, resulting in warnings when
the interface starts up, like

I don't find an appropriate firmware interface to implement settime64()
for iwlwifi MLD/MVM, thus instead create a stub that returns
-EOPTNOTSUPP only, suppressing the warning and allowing the PTP clock to
be registered.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71227 | wifi: mac80211: don&amp;#x27;t WARN for connections on invalid channels</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71227</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset

During Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle and becomes
temporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers
during this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads)
can result in uncompleted PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or
system hangs.

To prevent this, set the `no_hw_access` flag to true immediately after
triggering the reset. This signals other driver components to skip
register accesses while the device is offline.

A memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added to ensure the flag update is
globally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait
state.

Since rescue mount options will mark the full fs read-only, there should
be no new transaction triggered.

But during unmount we will evict all inodes, which can trigger a new
transaction, and triggers warnings on a heavily corrupted fs.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs allows new transaction even on a read-only fs, this is to allow
log replay happen even on read-only mounts, just like what ext4/xfs do.

However with rescue mount options, the fs is fully read-only and cannot
be remounted read-write, thus in that case we should also reject any new
transactions.

[FIX]
If we find the fs has rescue mount options, we should treat the fs as
error, so that no new transaction can be started.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23215 | x86/vmware: Fix hypercall clobbers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/vmware: Fix hypercall clobbers

Fedora QA reported the following panic:

  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000040003e54
  #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
  #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page

   psmouse_handle_byte+0x15/0x60
   ps2_interrupt+0x8a/0xd0
   ...

because the QEMU VMware mouse emulation is buggy, and clears the top 32
bits of %rdi that the kernel kept a pointer in.

The QEMU vmmouse driver saves and restores the register state in a
"uint32_t data[6];" and as a result restores the state with the high
bits all cleared.

RDI originally contained the value of a valid kernel stack address
(0xff5eeb3240003e54).  After the vmware hypercall it now contains
0x40003e54, and we get a page fault as a result when it is dereferenced.

The proper fix would be in QEMU, but this works around the issue in the
kernel to keep old setups working, when old kernels had not happened to
keep any state in %rdi over the hypercall.

In theory this same issue exists for all the hypercalls in the vmmouse
driver; in practice it has only been seen with vmware_hypercall3() and
vmware_hypercall4().  For now, just mark RDI/RSI as clobbered for those
two calls.  This should have a minimal effect on code generation overall
as it should be rare for the compiler to want to make RDI/RSI live
across hypercalls.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23216 | scsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23216</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If sbi_ecall.c's functions are traceable,

echo "__sbi_ecall:snapshot" &gt; /sys/kernel/tracing/set_ftrace_filter

(Functions in sbi_ecall.c are excluded from tracing if
CONFIG_RISCV_ALTERNATIVE_EARLY is set.)

__sbi_ecall triggers a snapshot of the ringbuffer. The snapshot code
raises an IPI interrupt, which results in another call to __sbi_ecall
and another snapshot...

All it takes to get into this endless loop is one initial __sbi_ecall.
On RISC-V systems without SSTC extension, the clock events in
timer-riscv.c issue periodic sbi ecalls, making the problem easy to
trigger.

Always exclude the sbi_ecall.c functions from tracing to fix the
potential deadlock.

sbi ecalls can easiliy be logged via trace events, excluding ecall
functions from function tracing is not a big limitation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23218 | gpio: loongson-64bit: Fix incorrect NULL check after devm_kcalloc()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23218</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When __memcg_slab_post_alloc_hook() fails, there are two different
free paths depending on whether size == 1 or size != 1. In the
kmem_cache_free_bulk() path, we do call alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook().
However, in memcg_alloc_abort_single() we don't, the above warning will be
triggered on the next allocation.

Therefore, add alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook() to the
memcg_alloc_abort_single() path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27099 | Jenkins 2.483 through 2.550 (both inclusive), LTS 2.492.1 through 2.541.1 (both inclusive) does not escape the user-provided description of ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27099</link><description>Jenkins 2.483 through 2.550 (both inclusive), LTS 2.492.1 through 2.541.1 (both inclusive) does not escape the user-provided description of the "Mark temporarily offline" offline cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure or Agent/Disconnect permission.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27100 | Jenkins 2.550 and earlier, LTS 2.541.1 and earlier accepts Run Parameter values that refer to builds the user submitting the build does not ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27100</link><description>Jenkins 2.550 and earlier, LTS 2.541.1 and earlier accepts Run Parameter values that refer to builds the user submitting the build does not have access to, allowing attackers with Item/Build and Item/Configure permission to obtain information about the existence of jobs, the existence of builds, and if a specified build exists, its display name.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2329 | Grandstream GXP1600 VoIP Phones - Unauthenticated stack buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2329</link><description>An unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the HTTP API endpoint /cgi-bin/api.values.get.

The application generates a new 'sessionId' each time a user authenticates, but does not invalidate previously issued session identifiers, which remain valid even after multiple consecutive logins by the same user. As a result, a stolen or leaked 'sessionId' can continue to be used to authenticate valid requests. Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker with access to the web service/API network (port 9000 or HTTP/S endpoint of the server) to reuse an old session token to gain unauthorized access to the application, interact with the API/web, and compromise the integrity of the affected account.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 14:13:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1436 | Improper Access Control (IDOR) vulnerability in Graylog Web Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1436</link><description>Improper Access Control (IDOR) in the Graylog API, version 2.2.3, which occurs when modifying the user ID in the URL.

This issue affects Apache Arrow C++ from 15.0.0 through 23.0.0. It can be triggered when reading an Arrow IPC file (but not an IPC stream) with pre-buffering enabled, if the IPC file contains data with variadic buffers (such as Binary View and String View data). Depending on the number of variadic buffers in a record batch column and on the temporal sequence of multi-threaded IO, a write to a dangling pointer could occur. The value (a `std::shared_ptr` object) that is written to the dangling pointer is not under direct control of the attacker.

Pre-buffering is disabled by default but can be enabled using a specific C++ API call (`RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`). The functionality is not exposed in language bindings (Python, Ruby, C GLib), so these bindings are not vulnerable.

The most likely consequence of this issue would be random crashes or memory corruption when reading specific kinds of IPC files. If the application allows ingesting IPC files from untrusted sources, this could plausibly be exploited for denial of service. Inducing more targeted kinds of misbehavior (such as confidential data extraction from the running process) depends on memory allocation and multi-threaded IO temporal patterns that are unlikely to be easily controlled by an attacker.

Advice for users of Arrow C++:

1. check whether you enable pre-buffering on the IPC file reader (using `RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`)

2. if so, either disable pre-buffering (which may have adverse performance consequences), or switch to Arrow 23.0.1 which is not vulnerable</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 13:46:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2615 | Wavlink WL-NU516U1 firewall.cgi singlePortForwardDelete command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2615</link><description>A flaw has been found in Wavlink WL-NU516U1 up to 20251208.

The Restricted annotation indicates additional privileges required to add the annotated component to the flow configuration, but framework authorization did not check restricted status when updating a component previously added. The missing authorization requires a more privileged user to add a restricted component to the flow configuration, but permits a less privileged user to make property configuration changes. Apache NiFi installations that do not implement different levels of authorization for Restricted components are not subject to this vulnerability because the framework enforces write permissions as the security boundary. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.8.0 is the recommended mitigation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:03:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1216 | RSS Aggregator &amp;lt;= 5.0.10 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via &amp;#x27;template&amp;#x27; Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1216</link><description>The RSS Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'template' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

For example, when {name}
 is used in an email template, it will  be replaced with the buyer's 
name for the final email. This mechanism contained two security-relevant
 bugs:



  *  
It was possible to exfiltrate information about the pretix system through specially crafted placeholder names such as {{event.__init__.__code__.co_filename}}.
 This way, an attacker with the ability to control email templates 
(usually every user of the pretix backend) could retrieve sensitive 
information from the system configuration, including even database 
passwords or API keys. pretix does include mechanisms to prevent the usage of such 
malicious placeholders, however due to a mistake in the code, they were 
not fully effective for the email subject.




  *  
Placeholders in subjects and plain text bodies of emails were 
wrongfully evaluated twice. Therefore, if the first evaluation of a 
placeholder again contains a placeholder, this second placeholder was 
rendered. This allows the rendering of placeholders controlled by the 
ticket buyer, and therefore the exploitation of the first issue as a 
ticket buyer. Luckily, the only buyer-controlled placeholder available 
in pretix by default (that is not validated in a way that prevents the 
issue) is {invoice_company}, which is very unusual (but not
 impossible) to be contained in an email subject template. In addition 
to broadening the attack surface of the first issue, this could 
theoretically also leak information about an order to one of the 
attendees within that order. However, we also consider this scenario 
very unlikely under typical conditions.


Out of caution, we recommend that you rotate all passwords and API keys contained in your  pretix.cfg https://docs.pretix.eu/self-hosting/config/  file.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 11:03:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2451 | Unsafe variable evaluation in email templates</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2451</link><description>Emails sent by pretix can utilize placeholders that will be filled with customer data.
