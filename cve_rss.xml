perf/core: Fix system hang caused by cpu-clock usage

cpu-clock usage by the async-profiler tool can trigger a system hang,
which got bisected back to the following commit by Octavia Togami:

  18dbcbfabfff ("perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage") causes this issue

The root cause of the hang is that cpu-clock is a special type of SW
event which relies on hrtimers. The __perf_event_overflow() callback
is invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and
__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()
to stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.

But that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,
which (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.

To fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set
the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()
to stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.

drm/sched: Fix deadlock in drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb

The Mesa issue referenced below pointed out a possible deadlock:

[ 1231.611031]  Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

[ 1231.611033]        CPU0                    CPU1
[ 1231.611034]        ----                    ----
[ 1231.611035]   lock(&amp;amp;xa-&gt;xa_lock#17);
[ 1231.611038]                                local_irq_disable();
[ 1231.611039]                                lock(&amp;amp;fence-&gt;lock);
[ 1231.611041]                                lock(&amp;amp;xa-&gt;xa_lock#17);
[ 1231.611044]   
[ 1231.611045]     lock(&amp;amp;fence-&gt;lock);
[ 1231.611047]
                *** DEADLOCK ***

In this example, CPU0 would be any function accessing job-&gt;dependencies
through the xa_* functions that don't disable interrupts (eg:
drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()).

CPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling
callback so in an interrupt context. It will deadlock when trying to
grab the xa_lock which is already held by CPU0.

Replacing all xa_* usage by their xa_*_irq counterparts would fix
this issue, but Christian pointed out another issue: dma_fence_signal
takes fence.lock and so does dma_fence_add_callback.

  dma_fence_signal() // locks f1.lock
  -&gt; drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()
  -&gt; foreach dependencies
     -&gt; dma_fence_add_callback() // locks f2.lock

This will deadlock if f1 and f2 share the same spinlock.

To fix both issues, the code iterating on dependencies and re-arming them
is moved out to drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work().

payload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could
cause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.

This patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,
which is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag
is set, skb-&gt;ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,
ensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and
properly handle the corrupt packet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40338 | ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40338</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix oops in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.

I saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running the xe-fast-feedback
testlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.

The panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes.
Presumably what happens is that a process mmaps, unlocks because
of the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory left,
causing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since
there was nothing left to populate, and then oopses in
"mem_type_is_vram(tbo-&gt;resource-&gt;mem_type)" because tbo-&gt;resource
is NULL.

It's convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after
the test exits.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40341 | futex: Don&amp;#x27;t leak robust_list pointer on exec race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40341</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

futex: Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race

sys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list() use ptrace_may_access()
to check if the calling task is allowed to access another task's
robust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the
target process.

During exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a
privileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings
may change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before
this transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information
after the target becomes privileged.

A racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which
ptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a
privileged state via exec().

For example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a
setuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T
is still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions
based on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec
immediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory
mappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T-&gt;robust_list
without synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a
now-privileged process.

This violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could
expose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger
exploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized
disclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a
potential security risk.

Take a read lock on signal-&gt;exec_update_lock prior to invoking
ptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.
This ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the
check, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of
credentials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40342 | nvme-fc: use lock accessing port_state and rport state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40342</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-fc: avoid scheduling association deletion twice

When forcefully shutting down a port via the configfs interface,
nvmet_port_subsys_drop_link() first calls nvmet_port_del_ctrls() and
then nvmet_disable_port(). Both functions will eventually schedule all
remaining associations for deletion.

The current implementation checks whether an association is about to be
removed, but only after the work item has already been scheduled. As a
result, it is possible for the first scheduled work item to free all
resources, and then for the same work item to be scheduled again for
deletion.

Because the association list is an RCU list, it is not possible to take
a lock and remove the list entry directly, so it cannot be looked up
again. Instead, a flag (terminating) must be used to determine whether
the association is already in the process of being deleted.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 04:38:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40344 | ASoC: Intel: avs: Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40344</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seccomp: Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.

Our syzbot instance reported memory leaks in do_seccomp() [0], similar
to the report [1].  It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter
and some objects included in it.

We can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one
seccomp() and two clone() syscalls.

The first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a
signal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the
fatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives
the signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to
user space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()
to decrement the filter's refcount.

Initially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but
the commit 3a15fb6ed92c ("seccomp: release filter after task is fully
dead") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible
that the filter is no longer used.

To keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move
copy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
free_task() for future debugging.

wifi: ath11k: fix failed to find the peer with peer_id 0 when disconnected

It has a fail log which is ath11k_dbg in ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(),
as below, it will not print when debug_mask is not set ATH11K_DBG_DATA.
	ath11k_dbg(ab, ATH11K_DBG_DATA,
		  "failed to find the peer with peer_id %d\n",
		   ppdu_info.peer_id);

When run scan with station disconnected, the peer_id is 0 for case
HAL_RX_MPDU_START in ath11k_hal_rx_parse_mon_status_tlv() which called
from ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), and the peer_id of ppdu_info is
reset to 0 in the while loop, so it does not match condition of the
check "if (ppdu_info-&gt;peer_id == HAL_INVALID_PEERID" in the loop, and
then the log "failed to find the peer with peer_id 0" print after the
check in the loop, it is below call stack when debug_mask is set
ATH11K_DBG_DATA.

The reason is this commit 01d2f285e3e5 ("ath11k: decode HE status tlv")
add "memset(ppdu_info, 0, sizeof(struct hal_rx_mon_ppdu_info))" in
ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), but the commit does not initialize
the peer_id to HAL_INVALID_PEERID, then lead the check mis-match.

RDMA/siw: Fix QP destroy to wait for all references dropped.

Delay QP destroy completion until all siw references to QP are
dropped. The calling RDMA core will free QP structure after
successful return from siw_qp_destroy() call, so siw must not
hold any remaining reference to the QP upon return.
A use-after-free was encountered in xfstest generic/460, while
testing NFSoRDMA. Here, after a TCP connection drop by peer,
the triggered siw_cm_work_handler got delayed until after
QP destroy call, referencing a QP which has already freed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50667 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix memory leak in vmw_mksstat_add_ioctl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50667</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption

When manipulating xattr blocks, we can deadlock infinitely looping
inside ext4_xattr_block_set() where we constantly keep finding xattr
block for reuse in mbcache but we are unable to reuse it because its
reference count is too big. This happens because cache entry for the
xattr block is marked as reusable (e_reusable set) although its
reference count is too big. When this inconsistency happens, this
inconsistent state is kept indefinitely and so ext4_xattr_block_set()
keeps retrying indefinitely.

The inconsistent state is caused by non-atomic update of e_reusable bit.
e_reusable is part of a bitfield and e_reusable update can race with
update of e_referenced bit in the same bitfield resulting in loss of one
of the updates. Fix the problem by using atomic bitops instead.

This bug has been around for many years, but it became *much* easier
to hit after commit 65f8b80053a1 ("ext4: fix race when reusing xattr
blocks").</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50669 | misc: ocxl: fix possible name leak in ocxl_file_register_afu()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50669</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because the mm-&gt;context.vdso_info is NULL in vfork case. From
another side, mm-&gt;context.vdso_info either points to vdso info

arm64: mte: Avoid setting PG_mte_tagged if no tags cleared or restored

Prior to commit 69e3b846d8a7 ("arm64: mte: Sync tags for pages where PTE
is untagged"), mte_sync_tags() was only called for pte_tagged() entries
(those mapped with PROT_MTE). Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use
test_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, &amp;amp;page-&gt;flags) without inadvertently
setting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.

The above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any
control at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.
However, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like
swap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A
subsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination
page even if the tags were owned by KASAN.

This issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in
commit e5b8d9218951 ("arm64: mte: reset the page tag in page-&gt;flags").
When this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting
access faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the
original page-&gt;flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y):

  BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in copy_page+0x10/0xd0 arch/arm64/lib/copy_page.S:26

  Pointer tag: [f5], memory tag: [f2]

Move the PG_mte_tagged bit setting from mte_sync_tags() to the actual
place where tags are cleared (mte_sync_page_tags()) or restored
(mte_restore_tags()).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50676 | net: rds: don&amp;#x27;t hold sock lock when cancelling work from rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50676</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This was caused because of new buffers with different RX ring count should
substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in
i40e_configure_rx_ring and reallocated again with i40e_alloc_rx_bi,
thus kfree on rx_bi caused leak of already mapped DMA.

Fix this by reallocating ZC with rx_bi_zc struct when BPF program loads. Additionally
reallocate back to rx_bi when BPF program unloads.

If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate
RX queues accordingly in XSP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53820 | loop: loop_set_status_from_info() check before assignment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53820</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Ignore frags from uninitialized peer in dp.

When max virtual ap interfaces are configured in all the bands with
ACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at
random times.
In this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for
self peer, for which rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in
datapath. While handling this fragment, crash is observed as the
rx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in
ath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags, skb null leads to exception.

To address this, before processing received fragments we check
dp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its
dp peer setup for fragment queue, else ignore processing the
fragments.

block/rq_qos: protect rq_qos apis with a new lock

commit 50e34d78815e ("block: disable the elevator int del_gendisk")
move rq_qos_exit() from disk_release() to del_gendisk(), this will
introduce some problems:

1) If rq_qos_add() is triggered by enabling iocost/iolatency through
   cgroupfs, then it can concurrent with del_gendisk(), it's not safe to
   write 'q-&gt;rq_qos' concurrently.

2) Activate cgroup policy that is relied on rq_qos will call
   rq_qos_add() and blkcg_activate_policy(), and if rq_qos_exit() is
   called in the middle, null-ptr-dereference will be triggered in
   blkcg_activate_policy().

3) blkg_conf_open_bdev() can call blkdev_get_no_open() first to find the
   disk, then if rq_qos_exit() from del_gendisk() is done before
   rq_qos_add(), then memory will be leaked.

This patch add a new disk level mutex 'rq_qos_mutex':

1) The lock will protect rq_qos_exit() directly.

2) For wbt that doesn't relied on blk-cgroup, rq_qos_add() can only be
   called from disk initialization for now because wbt can't be
   destructed until rq_qos_exit(), so it's safe not to protect wbt for
   now. Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported
   in the furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()
   directly, this is enough because blk-sysfs already synchronize
   writers with disk removal.

3) For iocost and iolatency, in order to synchronize disk removal and
   cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()

kcm: Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().

syzkaller found a memory leak in kcm_sendmsg(), and commit c821a88bd720
("kcm: Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()") suppressed it by
updating kcm_tx_msg(head)-&gt;last_skb if partial data is copied so that the
following sendmsg() will resume from the skb.

However, we cannot know how many bytes were copied when we get the error.
Thus, we could mess up the MSG_MORE queue.

When kcm_sendmsg() fails for SOCK_DGRAM, we should purge the queue as we
do so for UDP by udp_flush_pending_frames().

Even without this change, when the error occurred, the following sendmsg()
resumed from a wrong skb and the queue was messed up.  However, we have
yet to get such a report, and only syzkaller stumbled on it.  So, this
can be changed safely.

Note this does not change SOCK_SEQPACKET behaviour.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53826 | ubi: Fix UAF wear-leveling entry in eraseblk_count_seq_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53826</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Wear-leveling entry could be freed in error path, which may be accessed

    kmem_cache_free(ubi_wl_entry_slab, e)
		                   erase_count = wl-&gt;ec  // UAF!

Wear-leveling entry updating/accessing in ubi-&gt;lookuptbl should be
protected by ubi-&gt;wl_lock, fix it by adding ubi-&gt;wl_lock to serialize
wl entry accessing between wl_entry_destroy() and
eraseblk_count_seq_show().

md/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request

init_resync() inits mempool and sets conf-&gt;have_replacemnt at the beginning
of sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.

After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but
close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio-&gt;dev[i].repl_bio.

The following is one way to reproduce the issue.

  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev-&gt;recovery_cp is set
     to MaxSector.
  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf-&gt;have_replacement is set to
     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.
  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.
  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.
  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf-&gt;have_replacemnt is
     0. r10bio-&gt;dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref
     occurs.

Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.

drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't

for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was

Since the driver doesn't declare a compatible string "ti,ina232", the OF
matching succeeds on "ti,ina231". But the I2C device ID info is
populated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in
of_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no "ina232" entry in the legacy
I2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the
probe function is NULL.

Fix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which
points to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a
generic one to the ina2xx_config table.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53835 | ext4: don&amp;#x27;t clear SB_RDONLY when remounting r/w until quota is re-enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53835</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes

There is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced
after userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt
dropped to zer0 causing use after free.

The flow is the following:

  while ((skb = skb_peek(&amp;amp;psock-&gt;ingress_skb))
    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock, skb, ..., ingress)
    if (!ingress) ...
    sk_psock_skb_ingress
       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)
          msg-&gt;skb = skb
          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock, msg)
    skb_dequeue(&amp;amp;psock-&gt;ingress_skb)

The sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is
what the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can
read this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook
will also read msg-&gt;skb and then after user space reads the msg will call
consume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.

But, the race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to
the skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the
user reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.

The !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses
sendmsg_*(sk, msg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the
stack.

The following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen':

To fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the
engress queue. This bumps the skb-&gt;users refcnt so that consume_skb()
and kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can
be sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just
need to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which
we do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg
case.

Before locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we
couldn't race with user and there was no issue here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53837 | drm/msm: fix NULL-deref on snapshot tear down</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53837</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Recent changes in net-next (commit 759ab1edb56c ("net: store netdevs

and let syzbot surface a latent problem in ovs. ovs does not validate
ifindex, making it possible to create netdev ports with negative
ifindex values. It's easy to repro with YNL:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_datapath.yaml \
         --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": 1, "name":"my-dp"}'
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

$ ip link show

    link/ether 7a:48:21:ad:0b:fb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
...

Validate the inputs. Now the second command correctly returns:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

nilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()

If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block
address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,
nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as
-ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.

This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing
it to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.

In particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,
semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.

node-&gt;i.i_addr[ADDRS_PER_BLOCK() - 1], result in out-of-boundary access.

This patch fixes to add sanity check on dnode page in truncate_dnode(),
so that, it can help to avoid triggering such issue, and once it encounters
such issue, it will record newly introduced ERROR_INVALID_NODE_REFERENCE
error into superblock, later fsck can detect such issue and try repairing.

Also, it removes f2fs_truncate_data_blocks() for cleanup due to the
function has only one caller, and uses f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range()
instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53847 | usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53847</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()

Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in
the alauda subdriver of usb-storage:

The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB
transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What
should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a
reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is
present.

A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in
alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the
call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
a debugging message.

Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact
that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.
Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for
uses like this.  We'll use it instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53848 | md/raid5-cache: fix a deadlock in r5l_exit_log()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53848</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit b13015af94cf ("md/raid5-cache: Clear conf-&gt;log after finishing

 conf-&gt;log = NULL

Fix this problem by setting 'config-&gt;log' to NULL before wake_up() as it
used to be, so that wait_event() from r5c_disable_writeback_async() can
exist. In the meantime, move forward md_unregister_thread() so that

drm/msm/dp: Drop aux devices together with DP controller

Using devres to depopulate the aux bus made sure that upon a probe
deferral the EDP panel device would be destroyed and recreated upon next
attempt.

But the struct device which the devres is tied to is the DPUs
(drm_dev-&gt;dev), which may be happen after the DP controller is torn
down.

Indications of this can be seen in the commonly seen EDID-hexdump full
of zeros in the log, or the occasional/rare KASAN fault where the
panel's attempt to read the EDID information causes a use after free on
DP resources.

It's tempting to move the devres to the DP controller's struct device,
but the resources used by the device(s) on the aux bus are explicitly
torn down in the error path. The KASAN-reported use-after-free also
remains, as the DP aux "module" explicitly frees its devres-allocated
memory in this code path.

As such, explicitly depopulate the aux bus in the error path, and in the
component unbind path, to avoid these issues.

ASoC: mediatek: mt8186: Fix use-after-free in driver remove path

When devm runs function in the "remove" path for a device it runs them
in the reverse order. That means that if you have parts of your driver
that aren't using devm or are using "roll your own" devm w/
devm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.

The mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in
mt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then
went on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of
mt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call
mt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,
the order was wrong.

Specifically at probe time, the order was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()
2. afe_priv-&gt;clk = devm_kcalloc(...)
3. afe_priv-&gt;clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)

At remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()
3. Free all of afe_priv-&gt;clk[i]
2. Free afe_priv-&gt;clk

The above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to
fix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let's move the
devm_add_action_or_reset() to the right place. In addition to fixing
the use-after-free, code inspection shows that this fixes a leak
(missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have
happened if any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in
mt8186_init_clock() had failed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53855 | net: dsa: ocelot: call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() under rtnl_lock() on driver remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53855</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early

When of_overlay_fdt_apply() fails, the changeset may be partially
applied, and the caller is still expected to call of_overlay_remove() to
clean up this partial state.

However, of_overlay_apply() calls of_resolve_phandles() before
init_overlay_changeset().  Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an
unresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still
uninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in
overlay_removal_is_ok().

Fix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from
init_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other
early initialization is done.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53857 | bpf: bpf_sk_storage: Fix invalid wait context lockdep report</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53857</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It complains about acquiring a local_lock while holding a raw_spin_lock.
It means it should not allocate memory while holding a raw_spin_lock
since it is not safe for RT.

raw_spin_lock is needed because bpf_local_storage supports tracing
context. In particular for task local storage, it is easy to
get a "current" task PTR_TO_BTF_ID in tracing bpf prog.
However, task (and cgroup) local storage has already been moved to
bpf mem allocator which can be used after raw_spin_lock.

The splat is for the sk storage. For sk (and inode) storage,
it has not been moved to bpf mem allocator. Using raw_spin_lock or not,
kzalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) could theoretically be unsafe in tracing context.
However, the local storage helper requires a verifier accepted
sk pointer (PTR_TO_BTF_ID), it is hypothetical if that (mean running
a bpf prog in a kzalloc unsafe context and also able to hold a verifier
accepted sk pointer) could happen.

This patch avoids kzalloc after raw_spin_lock to silent the splat.
There is an existing kzalloc before the raw_spin_lock. At that point,
a kzalloc is very likely required because a lookup has just been done
before. Thus, this patch always does the kzalloc before acq

dm: don't attempt to queue IO under RCU protection

dm looks up the table for IO based on the request type, with an
assumption that if the request is marked REQ_NOWAIT, it's fine to
attempt to submit that IO while under RCU read lock protection. This
is not OK, as REQ_NOWAIT just means that we should not be sleeping
waiting on other IO, it does not mean that we can't potentially
schedule.

A simple test case demonstrates this quite nicely:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        struct iovec iov;
        int fd;

        fd = open("/dev/dm-0", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECT);
        posix_memalign(&amp;amp;iov.iov_base, 4096, 4096);
        iov.iov_len = 4096;
        preadv2(fd, &amp;amp;iov, 1, 0, RWF_NOWAIT);
        return 0;
}

which will instantly spew:

When disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_update(),
overlay plane's framebuffer pointer is NULL.  So, dereferencing it would
cause a kernel Oops(NULL pointer dereferencing).  Fix the issue by
disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_disable() instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53865 | btrfs: fix warning when putting transaction with qgroups enabled after abort</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This corresponds to this line of code:

  void btrfs_put_transaction(struct btrfs_transaction *transaction)
  {
      (...)
          WARN_ON(!RB_EMPTY_ROOT(
                          &amp;amp;transaction-&gt;delayed_refs.dirty_extent_root));
      (...)
  }

The warning happens because btrfs_qgroup_destroy_extent_records(), called
in the transaction abort path, we free all entries from the rbtree
"dirty_extent_root" with rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe(), but we
don't actually empty the rbtree - it's still pointing to nodes that were
freed.

So set the rbtree's root node to NULL to avoid this warning (assign
RB_ROOT).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53866 | ASoC: soc-compress: Reposition and add pcm_mutex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53866</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: soc-compress: Reposition and add pcm_mutex

If panic_on_warn is set and compress stream(DPCM) is started,
then kernel panic occurred because card-&gt;pcm_mutex isn't held appropriately.
In the following functions, warning were issued at this line
"snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held".

static int dpcm_be_connect(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *fe,
		struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *be, int stream)
{
	...
	snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held(fe);
	...
}

void dpcm_be_disconnect(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *fe, int stream)
{
	...
	snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held(fe);
	...
}

void snd_soc_runtime_action(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *rtd,
			    int stream, int action)

	int event)
{
	...
	snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held(fe);
	...
}

These functions are called by soc_compr_set_params_fe, soc_compr_open_fe
and soc_compr_free_fe
without pcm_mutex locking. And this is call stack.

Versions 2.0.14 and below use Gin's default configuration which trusts all IP addresses as proxies (TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0), allowing any client to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. Since all IP-based access controls (AllowIPs, API whitelists, localhost-only checks) rely on ClientIP(), attackers can bypass these protections by simply sending X-Forwarded-For:  127.0.0.1 or any whitelisted IP. This renders all IP-based security controls ineffective.

For example, a request to http://mydomain.example.com/admin%2F could reach service-a without triggering my-security-middleware, bypassing security controls for the /admin/ path.

While it's not freed back to system when kexec kernel is reloaded or
unloaded.  Then memory leak is caused.  Fix it by introducing riscv
specific function arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup(), and freeing the
buffer there.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50632 | drivers: perf: marvell_cn10k: Fix hotplug callback leak in tad_pmu_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50632</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The address being probed has some special:

  cmdline_proc_show: Probe based on ftrace
  cmdline_proc_show+16: Probe for the next instruction at the ftrace location

The ftrace-based kprobe does not generate kprobe::ainsn::insn, it gets
set to NULL. In arch_prepare_kprobe() it will check for:

  ...
  prev = get_kprobe(p-&gt;addr - 1);
  preempt_enable_no_resched();
  if (prev &amp;&amp; ppc_inst_prefixed(ppc_inst_read(prev-&gt;ainsn.insn))) {
  ...

If prev is based on ftrace, 'ppc_inst_read(prev-&gt;ainsn.insn)' will occur
with a null pointer reference. At this point prev-&gt;addr will not be a
prefixed instruction, so the check can be skipped.

Check if prev is ftrace-based kprobe before reading 'prev-&gt;ainsn.insn'
to fix this problem.

PCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF

pci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the
Vendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they
aren't present.  Check the PF instead.

Wei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is
unbound or "0" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O
operation hangs, which may result in output like this:

  task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002

This happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned "false" in
virtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().  The broken vq
meant that vring_interrupt() skipped the vq.callback() that would have
completed the virtio I/O operation via virtblk_done().

==================================================================

In the above issue, ioctl invokes the swap_inode_boot_loader function to
swap inode&lt;5&gt; and inode&lt;12&gt;. However, inode&lt;5&gt; contain incorrect imode and
disordered extents, and i_nlink is set to 1. The extents check for inode in
the ext4_iget function can be bypassed bacause 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO.
While links_count is set to 1, the extents are not initialized in
swap_inode_boot_loader. After the ioctl command is executed successfully,
the extents are swapped to inode&lt;12&gt;, in this case, run the `cat` command
to view inode&lt;12&gt;. And Bug_ON is triggered due to the incorrect extents.

When the boot loader inode is not initialized, its imode can be one of the
following:
1) the imode is a bad type, which is marked as bad_inode in ext4_iget and
   set to S_IFREG.
2) the imode is good type but not S_IFREG.
3) the imode is S_IFREG.

The BUG_ON may be triggered by bypassing the check in cases 1 and 2.
Therefore, when the boot loader inode is bad_inode or its imode is not
S_IFREG, initialize the inode to avoid triggering the BUG.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50639 | io-wq: Fix memory leak in worker creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50639</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

For simplicity address the problem by adding PCI_IOBASE to the physical
address requested in the respective wrapper macros only, observing that
the raw accessors such as `__insb', `__outsb', etc. are not supposed to
be used other than by said macros.  Remove the cast to `long' that is no
longer needed on `addr' now that it is used as an offset from PCI_IOBASE
and add parentheses around `addr' needed for predictable evaluation in
macro expansion.  No need to make said adjustments in separate changes
given that current code is gravely broken and does not ever work.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50648 | ftrace: Fix recursive locking direct_mutex in ftrace_modify_direct_caller</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50648</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix reference state management for synchronous callbacks

Currently, verifier verifies callback functions (sync and async) as if
they will be executed once, (i.e. it explores execution state as if the
function was being called once). The next insn to explore is set to
start of subprog and the exit from nested frame is handled using
curframe &gt; 0 and prepare_func_exit. In case of async callback it uses a
customized variant of push_stack simulating a kind of branch to set up
custom state and execution context for the async callback.

While this approach is simple and works when callback really will be
executed only once, it is unsafe for all of our current helpers which
are for_each style, i.e. they execute the callback multiple times.

A callback releasing acquired references of the caller may do so
multiple times, but currently verifier sees it as one call inside the
frame, which then returns to caller. Hence, it thinks it released some
reference that the cb e.g. got access through callback_ctx (register
filled inside cb from spilled typed register on stack).

Similarly, it may see that an acquire call is unpaired inside the
callback, so the caller will copy the reference state of callback and
then will have to release the register with new ref_obj_ids. But again,
the callback may execute multiple times, but the verifier will only
account for acquired references for a single symbolic execution of the
callback, which will cause leaks.

Note that for async callback case, things are different. While currently
we have bpf_timer_set_callback which only executes it once, even for
multiple executions it would be safe, as reference state is NULL and
check_reference_leak would force program to release state before
BPF_EXIT. The state is also unaffected by analysis for the caller frame.
Hence async callback is safe.

Since we want the reference state to be accessible, e.g. for pointers
loaded from stack through callback_ctx's PTR_TO_STACK, we still have to
copy caller's reference_state to callback's bpf_func_state, but we
enforce that whatever references it adds to that reference_state has
been released before it hits BPF_EXIT. This requires introducing a new
callback_ref member in the reference state to distinguish between caller
vs callee references. Hence, check_reference_leak now errors out if it
sees we are in callback_fn and we have not released callback_ref refs.
Since there can be multiple nested callbacks, like frame 0 -&gt; cb1 -&gt; cb2
etc. we need to also distinguish between whether this particular ref
belongs to this callback frame or parent, and only error for our own, so
we store state-&gt;frameno (which is always non-zero for callbacks).

In short, callbacks can read parent reference_state, but cannot mutate
it, to be able to use pointers acquired by the caller. They must only
undo their changes (by releasing their own acquired_refs before
BPF_EXIT) on top of caller reference_state before returning (at which
point the caller and callback state will match anyway, so no need to
copy it back to caller).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50651 | ethtool: eeprom: fix null-deref on genl_info in dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50651</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

('myfpga' is a simple 'uio_dmem_genirq' driver I wrote to test this)

The implementation of "uio_dmem_genirq" was based on "uio_pdrv_genirq" and
it is used in a similar manner to the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver with respect
to interrupt configuration and handling. At the time "uio_dmem_genirq" was
introduced, both had the same implementation of the 'uio_info' handlers
irqcontrol() and handler(). Then commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix concurrency
issue"), which was only applied to "uio_pdrv_genirq", ended up making them
a little different. That commit, among other things, changed disable_irq()
to disable_irq_nosync() in the implementation of irqcontrol(). The
motivation there was to avoid a deadlock between irqcontrol() and
handler(), since it added a spinlock in the irq handler, and disable_irq()
waits for the completion of the irq handler.

By changing disable_irq() to disable_irq_nosync() in irqcontrol(), we also
avoid the sleeping-whil

mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value,
it will lead two issues:
1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is leaked.
2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to

So fix this by checking the return value and calling mmc_free_host()

erofs: kill hooked chains to avoid loops on deduplicated compressed images

After heavily stressing EROFS with several images which include a
hand-crafted image of repeated patterns for more than 46 days, I found
two chains could be linked with each other almost simultaneously and
form a loop so that the entire loop won't be submitted.  As a
consequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.

It can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.
For example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total:
	Chain 1:  2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;
        Chain 2:  5-&gt;1-&gt;2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.

Chain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link
to Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.

Since hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how
to simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely
until I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally
tell us that it's needed to add it back.

Actually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads
(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm
not sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared
with implementation complexity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53778 | accel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53778</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()

The encode_dma() function has some validation on in_trans-&gt;size but it
would be more clear to move those checks to find_and_map_user_pages().

The encode_dma() had two checks:

	if (in_trans-&gt;addr + in_trans-&gt;size &lt; in_trans-&gt;addr || !in_trans-&gt;size)
		return -EINVAL;

The in_trans-&gt;addr variable is the starting address.  The in_trans-&gt;size
variable is the total size of the transfer.  The transfer can occur in
parts and the resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size tracks how many bytes we have
already transferred.

This patch introduces a new variable "remaining" which represents the
amount we want to transfer (in_trans-&gt;size) minus the amount we have
already transferred (resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size).

I have modified the check for if in_trans-&gt;size is zero to instead check
if in_trans-&gt;size is less than resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size.  If we have
already transferred more bytes than in_trans-&gt;size then there are negative
bytes remaining which doesn't make sense.  If there are zero bytes
remaining to be copied, just return success.

The check in encode_dma() checked that "addr + size" could not overflow
and barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if
we do this in parts.  First check that "in_trans-&gt;addr +
resources-&gt;xferred_dma_size" is safe.  Then check that "xfer_start_addr +
remaining" is safe.

My final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit
systems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits.  So
I calculated "total = in_trans-&gt;size + offset_in_page(xfer_start_addr);"
and returned -EINVAL if it were &gt;= SIZE_MAX.  This will not affect 64bit
systems.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53779 | mfd: dln2: Fix memory leak in dln2_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53779</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().

With Eric's ref tracker, syzbot finally found a repro for
use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler() by kernel TCP
sockets. [0]

If SMC creates a kernel socket in __smc_create(), the kernel
socket is supposed to be freed in smc_clcsock_release() by
calling sock_release() when we close() the parent SMC socket.

However, at the end of smc_clcsock_release(), the kernel
socket's sk_state might not be TCP_CLOSE.  This means that
we have not called inet_csk_destroy_sock() in __tcp_close()
and have not stopped the TCP timers.

The kernel socket's TCP timers can be fired later, so we
need to hold a refcnt for net as we do for MPTCP subflows
in mptcp_subflow_create_socket().

drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc

Commit 5d844091f237 ("drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs") changed the scdc
interface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in
the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter
information, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated
when the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.

drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to
a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer
instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.

mt76: mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers

mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() and
mt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr(), both of which blindly assume that
adequate headroom will be available in the passed skb. This assumption
typically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for
transmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an
optimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is
sometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of
another netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the
bridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.

This commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to
mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to
ensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be
pushed onto the skb.

Without this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an
MT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an
Intel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet
adapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard
SMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in
every system configuration, as they occur only if the receiving netdev
leaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its
SDIO headers.

Here is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite
2023-02-21 running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]:

For htab map, just like the preallocated case, these is no need to
initialize these special fields in map value again once these fields
have been initialized. For preallocated htab map, these fields are
initialized through __GFP_ZERO in bpf_map_area_alloc(), so do the
similar thing for non-preallocated htab in bpf memory allocator. And
there is no need to use __GFP_ZERO for per-cpu bpf memory allocator,
because __alloc_percpu_gfp() does it implicitly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53791 | md: fix warning for holder mismatch from export_rdev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53791</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: fix warning for holder mismatch from export_rdev()

Commit a1d767191096 ("md: use mddev-&gt;external to select holder in
export_rdev()") fix the problem that 'claim_rdev' is used for
blkdev_get_by_dev() while 'rdev' is used for blkdev_put().

However, if mddev-&gt;external is changed from 0 to 1, then 'rdev' is used
for blkdev_get_by_dev() while 'claim_rdev' is used for blkdev_put(). And
this problem can be reporduced reliably by following:

As part of the sequence to join the two existing primitives together.

Allowing the refcount the be elevated without holding the destroy_rwsem
violates the assumption that all temporary refcount elevations are

The solution is to not increment the refcount on the IOMMUFD_DESTROY path
at all. Instead use the xa_lock to serialize everything. The refcount
check == 1 and xa_erase can be done under a single critical region. This
avoids the need for any refcount incrementing.

It has the downside that if userspace races destroy with other operations
it will get an EBUSY instead of waiting, but this is kind of racing is
already dangerous.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53796 | f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53796</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()

When converting an inline directory to a regular one, f2fs is leaking
uninitialized memory to disk because it doesn't initialize the entire
directory block.  Fix this by zero-initializing the block.

This bug was introduced by commit 4ec17d688d74 ("f2fs: avoid unneeded
initializing when converting inline dentry"), which didn't consider the
security implications of leaking uninitialized memory to disk.

This was found by running xfstest generic/435 on a KMSAN-enabled kernel.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53797 | HID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53797</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps

Code which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type
returned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer
enough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a
recipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur
when calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being
reported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause input
handling in userspace to appear hung.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53798 | ethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53798</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes

It is not possible to set the number of lanes when setting link modes
using the legacy IOCTL ethtool interface. Since 'struct
ethtool_link_ksettings' is not initialized in this path, drivers receive
an uninitialized number of lanes in 'struct
ethtool_link_ksettings::lanes'.

When this information is later queried from drivers, it results in the
ethtool code making decisions based on uninitialized memory, leading to
the following KMSAN splat [1]. In practice, this most likely only
happens with the tun driver that simply returns whatever it got in the
set operation.

As far as I can tell, this uninitialized memory is not leaked to user
space thanks to the 'ethtool_ops-&gt;cap_link_lanes_supported' check in
linkmodes_prepare_data().

Fix by initializing the structure in the IOCTL path. Did not find any
more call sites that pass an uninitialized structure when calling
'ethtool_ops::set_link_ksettings()'.

nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()

During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  However, since
nilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may
cause use-after-free read if inodes are left in "garbage_list" and
released by nilfs_dispose_list() at the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer().

Fix this issue by modifying nilfs_evict_inode() to only clear inode
without additional metadata changes that use nilfs_root if the file system
is degraded to read-only or the writer is detached.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53805 | tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53805</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[Why]
System restart observed while changing the display resolution

[How]
When the driver populates subvp info it did it for both the pipes using
vblank which caused an outof bounds array access causing the page fault.

l2tp: Avoid possible recursive deadlock in l2tp_tunnel_register()

When a file descriptor of pppol2tp socket is passed as file descriptor
of UDP socket, a recursive deadlock occurs in l2tp_tunnel_register().
This situation is reproduced by the following program:

int main(void)
{
	int sock;
	struct sockaddr_pppol2tp addr;

	sock = socket(AF_PPPOX, SOCK_DGRAM, PX_PROTO_OL2TP);
	if (sock &lt; 0) {
		perror("socket");
		return 1;
	}

	addr.sa_family = AF_PPPOX;
	addr.sa_protocol = PX_PROTO_OL2TP;
	addr.pppol2tp.pid = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.fd = sock;
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_family = PF_INET;
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_port = htons(0);
	addr.pppol2tp.addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.0.1");
	addr.pppol2tp.s_tunnel = 1;
	addr.pppol2tp.s_session = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.d_tunnel = 0;
	addr.pppol2tp.d_session = 0;

	if (connect(sock, (const struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(addr)) &lt; 0) {
		perror("connect");
		return 1;
	}

	return 0;
}

This program causes the following lockdep warning:

blk-mq: release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete

Once all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed, filesystems can call
blk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn't call
blk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens
after upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has
completed.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()
can see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.

This makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the
'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&amp;amp;slot-&gt;slot_refs) != 0)' and return without
doing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in
blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This is a very rare bug and has only
been seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)

There are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before
bio_endio() is called on the request's last bio, or make
__blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let's go with the first
solution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via
WARN_ON_ONCE) where a key is evicted while still in-use.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53811 | RDMA/irdma: Cap MSIX used to online CPUs + 1</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53811</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix rbtree traversal bug in ext4_mb_use_preallocated

During allocations, while looking for preallocations(PA) in the per
inode rbtree, we can't do a direct traversal of the tree because
ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocation() can paralelly mark the pa deleted
and that can cause direct traversal to skip some entries. This was
leading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy
our request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap
with the missed one.

To makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of
the rbtree, we make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly
overlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below
conditions:

  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of
  (ie less than) original logical start.

  2. It must not be deleted

To find this pa we use the following traversal method:

1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring
PA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if
it overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately
adjacent PA.

2. If the found PA is on right of original goal, use rb_prev() to find
the left adjacent PA.

3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until
a non deleted PA is found.

4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy
the original request and proceed accordingly.

This approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.

PCI: Fix dropping valid root bus resources with .end = zero

On r8a7791/koelsch:

  kmemleak: 1 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)

      [] devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources.constprop.0+0xb0/0x390

When coalescing two resources for a contiguous aperture, the second
resource is enlarged to cover the full contiguous range, while the first
resource is marked invalid.  This invalidation is done by clearing the
flags, start, and end members.

When adding the initial resources to the bus later, invalid resources are
skipped.  Unfortunately, the check for an invalid resource considers only
the end member, causing false positives.

E.g. on r8a7791/koelsch, root bus resource 0 ("bus 00") is skipped, and no
longer registered with pci_bus_insert_busn_res() (causing the memory leak),
nor printed:

   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci: host bridge /soc/pci@ee090000 ranges:
   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci:      MEM 0x00ee080000..0x00ee08ffff -&gt; 0x00ee080000
   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci: PCI: revision 11
   pci-rcar-gen2 ee090000.pci: PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
  -pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00]
   pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xee080000-0xee08ffff]

Fix this by only skipping resources where all of the flags, start, and end
members are zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53815 | posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53815</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()

itimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is concurrently expired. On
non-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has completed,
except for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK
enabled.

In that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when
preempting the task which does the timer delivery.

Replace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running() to handle
it the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53816 | drm/amdkfd: fix potential kgd_mem UAFs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53816</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: lib/mpi - avoid null pointer deref in mpi_cmp_ui()

During NVMeTCP Authentication a controller can trigger a kernel
oops by specifying the 8192 bit Diffie Hellman group and passing
a correctly sized, but zeroed Diffie Hellamn value.
mpi_cmp_ui() was detecting this if the second parameter was 0,
but 1 is passed from dh_is_pubkey_valid(). This causes the null

Versions 3.3.1 and below are subject to a XSS vulnerability through the ui.interactive_image component of NiceGUI. The component renders SVG content using Vue's v-html directive without any sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript via the SVG  tag whenever the image component is rendered or updated. This is particularly dangerous for dashboards or multi-user applications displaying user-generated content or annotations. This issue is fixed in version 3.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:11:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66469 | NiceGUI Reflected XSS in ui.add_css, ui.add_scss, and ui.add_sass via Style Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66469</link><description>NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework.

Versions 5.15.7 and below have a double URL encoding bypass which allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765 was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded URLs, attackers can still bypass authentication and access any route protected by middleware pathname checks.

Versions 0.123.1 through 1.119.1 do not have adequate protections to prevent RCE through the project's pre-commit hooks. The Add Config operation allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including core.hooksPath, which can point to a malicious Git hook that executes arbitrary commands on the n8n host during subsequent Git operations. Exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow using the Git node. This issue is fixed in version 1.119.2. Workarounds include excluding the Git Node (Docs) and avoiding cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 23:43:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65962 | Tuleap  has missing CSRF protections its in tracker field dependencies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65962</link><description>Tuleap is a free and open source suite for management of software development and collaboration.

application state (e.g. changing database entries, user data, 
configurations, or other privileged actions) may have been accessible 
via HTTP GET requests without requiring a CSRF token. This flaw leaves 
the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks:
 an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious 
website could cause the user’s browser to issue GET requests that 
perform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their 
authenticated session.


Because the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no 
CSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker 
could exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out
 other unauthorized actions without needing the user’s explicit consent 
or awareness. 

The fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST 
requests and include a valid CSRF token. This enforces that state 
changes cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests.



This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:29:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-42620 | CSRF vulnerability in CIRCL Vulnerability-Lookup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-42620</link><description>In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled 
content in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to 
stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).




On the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted 
arbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On 
the frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from 
Markdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string 
templates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could 
create or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript 
payloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of 
any user visiting the affected profile page (user.html).

Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /Admin/Controller/CustomController.class.php of the component Menu Management Page. This manipulation of the argument Link causes cross site scripting. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been published and may be used.

 One-Time Password (OTP) attempts during Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
 verification. An attacker who already knew or guessed a valid username 
and password could submit an arbitrary number of OTP codes without 
causing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert for 
administrators.


This lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly 
lowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and 
increases the risk of successful account takeover, especially if OTP 
entropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric codes, user reuse, or predictable
 tokens). Additionally, administrators had no direct visibility into 
accounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures, making targeted attacks 
harder to detect and investigate.


The patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts counter on user 
accounts, locks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions, resets the 
counter on successful verification, and surfaces failed 2FA attempts in 
the admin user list. This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP 
brute-force attempts and improves monitoring capabilities for suspicious
 2FA activity.This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:29:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14230 | code-projects Daily Time Recording System add_payroll.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14230</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in code-projects Daily Time Recording System 4.5.0.

The attacker must have permissions to access the jobs but then they were saved into the catalog service using the wrong owner permissions. Therefore it may have been possible to save into spaces where the attacker does not have write permissions.

There is no workaround.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 09:45:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66461 | FULLBACK Manager Pro provided by GS Yuasa International Ltd. registers  two Windows services with unquoted file paths.

md/raid0, raid10: Don't set discard sectors for request queue

It should use disk_stack_limits to get a proper max_discard_sectors
rather than setting a value by stack drivers.

And there is a bug. If all member disks are rotational devices,
raid0/raid10 set max_discard_sectors. So the member devices are
not ssd/nvme, but raid0/raid10 export the wrong value. It reports
warning messages in function __blkdev_issue_discard when mkfs.xfs
like this:

regulator: core: Use different devices for resource allocation and DT lookup

Following by the below discussion, there's the potential UAF issue
between regulator and mfd.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221128143601.1698148-1-yangyingliang@huawei.com/

From the analysis of Yingliang

CPU A				|CPU B
mt6370_probe()			|
  devm_mfd_add_devices()	|
				|mt6370_regulator_probe()
				|  regulator_register()
				|    //allocate init_data and add it to devres
				|    regulator_of_get_init_data()
i2c_unregister_device()		|
  device_del()			|
    devres_release_all()	|
      // init_data is freed	|
      release_nodes()		|
				|  // using init_data causes UAF
				|  regulator_register()

It's common to use mfd core to create child device for the regulator.
In order to do the DT lookup for init data, the child that registered
the regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes
init data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen
when parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing
some operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.

To fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the
different devices for init data allocation and DT lookup.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50617 | drm/amdgpu/powerplay/psm: Fix memory leak in power state init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register

Chapter "B Generic UART" in "ARM Server Base System Architecture" [1]
documentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART
does not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and
amba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke
pl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This
commit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the
access to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.

When the kernel enables DMA engine with "CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y", Linux
SBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.
For most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write
behaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause
obvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen
virtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.
Xen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is
accessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA
compatible, it will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA
PL011 driver access DMACR register, it will get an unhandled data abort
fault and the application will get a segmentation fault:

media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()

Syzbot reports a memory leak in "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".
The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's
adapter-&gt;priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,
it will exit before incrementing "num_adapters_initalized",
which is used as a reference counter to free all adap-&gt;priv
in "dvb_usb_adapter_exit()". There are multiple error paths that
can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the
error handling paths for "dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()",
"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()" and "dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()"
within "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".

This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the
current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's
adap-&gt;priv is not freed.

Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap-&gt;priv in the
"stream_init_err:" label in the error path. The rest of the
(accounted for) adap-&gt;priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()
as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.

The source of this warning is in iosys_map_clear() called from
dma_buf_vmap(). It conditionally sets values based on map-&gt;is_iomem. The
iosys_map variables are allocated uninitialized on the stack leading to
-&gt;is_iomem having all kinds of values and not only 0/1.

Fix this by zeroing the iosys_map variables.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50629 | wifi: rsi: Fix memory leak in rsi_coex_attach()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50629</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault

The vma_lock and hugetlb_fault_mutex are dropped before handling userfault
and reacquire them again after handle_userfault(), but reacquire the
vma_lock could lead to UAF[1,2] due to the following race,

hugetlb_fault
  hugetlb_no_page
    /*unlock vma_lock */
    hugetlb_handle_userfault
      handle_userfault
        /* unlock mm-&gt;mmap_lock*/
                                           vm_mmap_pgoff

        /* lock vma_lock again  &lt;--- UAF */
    /* unlock vma_lock */

Since the vma_lock will unlock immediately after
hugetlb_handle_userfault(), let's drop the unneeded lock and unlock in
hugetlb_handle_userfault() to fix the issue.

The reason for this is that on certain arm64 configuration since
e35123d83ee3 ("arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when
CONFIG_LTO=y"), READ_ONCE() may be promoted to a full atomic acquire
instruction which cannot be used on unaligned addresses.

Fix it by avoiding READ_ONCE() in read_instrumented_memory(), and simply
forcing the compiler to do the required access by casting to the
appropriate volatile type. In terms of generated code this currently
only affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()
implementation.

The only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the access
itself, although on most architectures a plain load up to machine word
size should still be atomic (a fact the default READ_ONCE() still relies
on itself).</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53743 | PCI: Free released resource after coalescing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver

The device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device
uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the
pointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The
problem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the
kfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the
vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.

Since the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev
object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53747 | vc_screen: reload load of struct vc_data pointer in vcs_write() to avoid UAF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000020081000

net: deal with integer overflows in kmalloc_reserve()

Blamed commit changed:
    ptr = kmalloc(size);
    if (ptr)
      size = ksize(ptr);

    size = kmalloc_size_roundup(size);
    ptr = kmalloc(size);

This allowed various crash as reported by syzbot [1]
and Kyle Zeng.

Problem is that if @size is bigger than 0x80000001,
kmalloc_size_roundup(size) returns 2^32.

kmalloc_reserve() uses a 32bit variable (obj_size),
so 2^32 is truncated to 0.

kmalloc(0) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is not handled by
skb allocations.

Following trace can be triggered if a netdev-&gt;mtu is set
close to 0x7fffffff

We might in the future limit netdev-&gt;mtu to more sensible
limit (like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE).

This patch is based on a syzbot report, and also a report
and tentative fix from Kyle Zeng.

the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function

KVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs

KVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as
a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,
evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark
that the msr bitmap was changed.

vmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr
-&gt; vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The
function checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is
insufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the
code might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value
left by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be
preempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple
times from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.

The manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the
solution is to use vmx-&gt;vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.

spi: atmel-quadspi: Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()

An early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove() doesn't prevent the device
unbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent
and unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).
So using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.

Instead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware
access and clk disable.

Also add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.
The latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by
the spi core.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53759 | HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead
acquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF in hci_disconnect_all_sync

Use-after-free can occur in hci_disconnect_all_sync if a connection is
deleted by concurrent processing of a controller event.

To prevent this the code now tries to iterate over the list backwards
to ensure the links are cleanup before its parents, also it no longer
relies on a cursor, instead it always uses the last element since
hci_abort_conn_sync is guaranteed to call hci_conn_del.

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly

The root cause is we applied both v1 and v2 of the patch, v2 is the right
fix, so it needs to revert v1 in order to fix reported issue.

v1:
commit d48a7b3a72f1 ("f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly")
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230109034920.492914-1-chao@kernel.org/

regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers

When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.

This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
allocation num_config_regs number of times.

This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.

Amit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device
due to memory corruption (see "Closes" tag for Amit's report). The KASAN

virtio-net: fix received length check in big packets

Since commit 4959aebba8c0 ("virtio-net: use mtu size as buffer length
for big packets"), when guest gso is off, the allocated size for big
packets is not MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE anymore but depends on
negotiated MTU. The number of allocated frags for big packets is stored
in vi-&gt;big_packets_num_skbfrags.

Because the host announced buffer length can be malicious (e.g. the host
vhost_net driver's get_rx_bufs is modified to announce incorrect
length), we need a check in virtio_net receive path. Currently, the
check is not adapted to the new change which can lead to NULL page
pointer dereference in the below while loop when receiving length that

Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix OOB access in parse_adv_monitor_pattern()

In the parse_adv_monitor_pattern() function, the value of
the 'length' variable is currently limited to HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH(251).
The size of the 'value' array in the mgmt_adv_pattern structure is 31.
If the value of 'pattern[i].length' is set in the user space
and exceeds 31, the 'patterns[i].value' array can be accessed
out of bound when copied.

Increasing the size of the 'value' array in
the 'mgmt_adv_pattern' structure will break the userspace.
Considering this, and to avoid OOB access revert the limits for 'offset'
and 'length' back to the value of HCI_MAX_AD_LENGTH.

fscrypt: fix left shift underflow when inode-&gt;i_blkbits &gt; PAGE_SHIFT

When simulating an nvme device on qemu with both logical_block_size and
physical_block_size set to 8 KiB, an error trace appears during
partition table reading at boot time. The issue is caused by
inode-&gt;i_blkbits being larger than PAGE_SHIFT, which leads to a left
shift of -1 and triggering a UBSAN warning.

This situation can happen for block devices because when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, the maximum logical_block_size
is 64 KiB. set_init_blocksize() then sets the block device
inode-&gt;i_blkbits to 13, which is within this limit.

File I/O does not trigger this problem because for filesystems that do
not support the FS_LBS feature, sb_set_blocksize() prevents
sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits from being larger than PAGE_SHIFT. During inode
allocation, alloc_inode()-&gt;inode_init_always() assigns inode-&gt;i_blkbits
from sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits. Currently, only xfs_fs_type has the FS_LBS
flag, and since xfs I/O paths do not reach submit_bh_wbc(), it does not
hit the left-shift underflow issue.

platform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister

regulator_unregister() already frees the associated GPIO device. On
ThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue that leads to
random failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to
allocate interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the
pinctrl_intel_platform module unexpectedly drops to zero when this
driver defers its probe.

This behavior can also be reproduced by unloading the module directly.

Fix the issue by removing the redundant release of the GPIO device
during regulator unregistration.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40297 | net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40297</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass

syzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is
due to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being
deleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been
toggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we
have MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN
filtering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't
happen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled
because we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop
learning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is
initialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port
state bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead
in the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.

btrfs: ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors

[BUG]
During development of a minor feature (make sure all btrfs_bio::end_io()
is called in task context), I noticed a crash in generic/388, where
metadata writes triggered new works after btrfs_stop_all_workers().

It turns out that it can even happen without any code modification, just
using RAID5 for metadata and the same workload from generic/388 is going
to trigger the use-after-free.

[CAUSE]
If btrfs hits an error, the fs is marked as error, no new
transaction is allowed thus metadata is in a frozen state.

But there are some metadata modifications before that error, and they are
still in the btree inode page cache.

Since there will be no real transaction commit, all those dirty folios
are just kept as is in the page cache, and they can not be invalidated
by invalidate_inode_pages2() call inside close_ctree(), because they are
dirty.

And finally after btrfs_stop_all_workers(), we call iput() on btree
inode, which triggers writeback of those dirty metadata.

And if the fs is using RAID56 metadata, this will trigger RMW and queue
new works into rmw_workers, which is already stopped, causing warning
from queue_work() and use-after-free.

[FIX]
Add a special handling for write_one_eb(), that if the fs is already in
an error state, immediately mark the bbio as failure, instead of really
submitting them.

Then during close_ctree(), iput() will just discard all those dirty
tree blocks without really writing them back, thus no more new jobs for
already stopped-and-freed workqueues.

The extra discard in write_one_eb() also acts as an extra safenet.
E.g. the transaction abort is triggered by some extent/free space
tree corruptions, and since extent/free space tree is already corrupted
some tree blocks may be allocated where they shouldn't be (overwriting
existing tree blocks). In that case writing them back will further
corrupting the fs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40304 | fbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40304</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

and clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the
X position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update
the character count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size
mismatches.

Without the character count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned
receive mismatched parameters where the buffer is allocated for the clipped
width but cnt reflects the original larger count, causing out-of-bounds writes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40305 | 9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40305</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN

p9_read_work() doesn't set Rworksched and doesn't do schedule_work(m-&gt;rq)
if list_empty(&amp;amp;m-&gt;req_list).

However, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to
work prior to commit aaec5a95d59615 ("pipe_read: don't wake up the writer
if the pipe is still full").

p9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -&gt; ... -&gt; anon_pipe_read() which (before
the commit above) triggered the unnecessary wakeup. This wakeup calls
p9_pollwake() which kicks p9_poll_workfn() -&gt; p9_poll_mux(), p9_poll_mux()
will notice EPOLLIN and schedule_work(&amp;amp;m-&gt;rq).

orangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...

Willy Tarreau  forwarded me a message from
Disclosure  with the following
warning:

&gt; The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition
&gt; rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL
&gt; (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on
&gt; valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging
&gt; the thread.

I easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel
oops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure
sent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based
this patch on.

After xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an
xattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns
a hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs
used hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using
hash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong
hash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a
getattr for the xattr "security.capability" every time. Orangefs
negative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the
xattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for
"security.capability" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were
ever freed.

I changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead
and the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40307 | exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40307</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation

exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing

the allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.

accel/habanalabs: support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory

When IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return
addresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without
VM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the
VM_PFNMAP restriction.

Fix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP
in the VMA before mapping. This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel
crashes. The memory is still driver-allocated and cannot be accessed
directly by userspace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40312 | jfs: Verify inode mode when loading from disk</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40312</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget

In the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget
structure (pdev-&gt;gadget) was freed before its endpoints.
The endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.
Freeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.
When the endpoints are subsequently freed, this results in a use-after-free.

Fix:
By separating the usb_del_gadget_udc() operation into distinct "del" and
"put" steps, cdnsp_gadget_free_endpoints() can be executed prior to the
final release of the gadget structure with usb_put_gadget().

A patch similar to bb9c74a5bd14("usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.

A race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently
with ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()
sets ffs-&gt;epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs-&gt;eps_count to 0, leading
to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile-&gt;ep in
ffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().

The ffs-&gt;epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and
ffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the
spinlock ffs-&gt;eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function
is also protected by ffs-&gt;eps_lock.

Thus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs-&gt;epfiles in the
ffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix issues</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40316 | drm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40316</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind

A recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking up drm
platform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial
fix which had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b ("drm/mediatek: Fix
kobject put for component sub-drivers").

This results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and
on unbind() which could lead to a user-after-free.

Make sure to only drop the references after retrieving the driver data
by effectively reverting the previous partial fix.

Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40317 | regmap: slimbus: fix bus_context pointer in regmap init calls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40317</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The __devm_regmap_init_slimbus() started to be used instead of
__regmap_init_slimbus() after the commit mentioned above and turns out
the incorrect bus_context pointer (3rd argument) was used in
__devm_regmap_init_slimbus(). It should be just "slimbus" (which is equal
to &amp;amp;slimbus-&gt;dev). Correct it. The wcd934x codec seems to be the only or
the first user of devm_regmap_init_slimbus() but we should fix it till
the point where __devm_regmap_init_slimbus() was introduced therefore
two "Fixes" tags.

While at this, also correct the same argument in __regmap_init_slimbus().</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40318 | Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40318</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: fix crash while sending Action Frames in standalone AP Mode

Currently, whenever there is a need to transmit an Action frame,
the brcmfmac driver always uses the P2P vif to send the "actframe" IOVAR to
firmware. The P2P interfaces were available when wpa_supplicant is managing
the wlan interface.

However, the P2P interfaces are not created/initialized when only hostapd
is managing the wlan interface. And if hostapd receives an ANQP Query REQ
Action frame even from an un-associated STA, the brcmfmac driver tries
to use an uninitialized P2P vif pointer for sending the IOVAR to firmware.
This NULL pointer dereferencing triggers a driver crash.

Fix this, by always using the vif corresponding to the wdev on which the
Action frame Transmission request was initiated by the userspace. This way,
even if P2P vif is not available, the IOVAR is sent to firmware on AP vif
and the ANQP Query RESP Action frame is transmitted without crashing the
driver.

Move init_completion() for "send_af_done" from brcmf_p2p_create_p2pdev()
to brcmf_p2p_attach(). Because the former function would not get executed
when only hostapd is managing wlan interface, and it is not safe to do
reinit_completion() later in brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame(), without any prior
init_completion().

And in the brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame() function, the condition check for
P2P Presence response frame is not needed, since the wpa_supplicant is
properly sending the P2P Presense Response frame on the P2P-GO vif instead
of the P2P-Device vif.

fbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*

bit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer from the
character value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font's
glyph count and read past the end of the built-in font array.
Clamp the index to the actual glyph count before computing the address.

This fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40323 | fbcon: Set fb_display[i]-&amp;gt;mode to NULL when the mode is released</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40323</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbcon: Set fb_display[i]-&gt;mode to NULL when the mode is released

Recently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:

Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
only the memory of fb_info-&gt;modelist is freed, without setting the
corresponding fb_display[i]-&gt;mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
steps:
1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
   to register a new device /dev/fb1;
2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
   a wild pointer in fb_display[];
5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
   from fb0.

Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40324 | NFSD: Fix crash in nfsd4_read_release()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40324</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes

NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new
attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it
ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.

RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:

&gt; The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client
&gt; requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the
&gt; target file system. If the server does not support a particular
&gt; attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the
&gt; attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result
&gt; bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
&gt; attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,
&gt; no attribute values will be returned.

Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:

&gt; These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,
&gt; and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR
&gt; by a client holding an appropriate delegation.

Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated
by specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes
via GETATTR is "invalid", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the
request entirely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14207 | tushar-2223 Hotel-Management-System invoiceprint.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14207</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in tushar-2223 Hotel-Management-System up to bb1f3b3666124b888f1e4bcf51b6fba9fbb01d15.

xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number

Since commit 30f241fcf52a ("xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor
production"), the descriptor number is stored in skb control block and
xsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto
pool's completion queue.

skb control block shouldn't be used for this purpose as after transmit
xsk doesn't have control over it and other subsystems could use it. This
leads to the following kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.
