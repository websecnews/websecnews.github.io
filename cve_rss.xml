versions before 1.979. A physically close 
attacker that is authenticated to the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface can use the network configuration service to inject commands in various configuration parameters including networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.PingTestIP, networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.DNSTestDomain, and networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Gateway6. Additionally, because the configuration can be synced to the Firewalla cloud, the attacker may be able to persist access even after hardware resets and firmware re-flashes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 18:53:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40892 | Firewalla BTLE Weak Credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40892</link><description>A weak credential vulnerability exists in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. This vulnerability allows a physically close attacker to use the license UUID for authentication and provision SSH credentials over the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface. Once an attacker gains access to the LAN, they could log into the SSH interface using the provisioned credentials. The license UUID can be acquired through plain-text Bluetooth sniffing, reading the QR code on the bottom of the device, or brute-forcing the UUID (though this is less likely).</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 18:43:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6768 | Denial of Service in CLFS.sys</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6768</link><description>A Denial of Service in CLFS.sys in Microsoft Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022 allows a malicious authenticated low-privilege user to cause a Blue Screen of Death via a forced call to the KeBugCheckEx function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 18:43:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42543 | TOTOLINK A3700R v9.1.2u.5822_B20200513 has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the http_host parameter in the loginauth function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42543</link><description>TOTOLINK A3700R v9.1.2u.5822_B20200513 has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the http_host parameter in the loginauth function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 18:27:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42545 | TOTOLINK A3700R v9.1.2u.5822_B20200513 has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ssid parameter in setWizardCfg function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42545</link><description>TOTOLINK A3700R v9.1.2u.5822_B20200513 has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ssid parameter in setWizardCfg function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 17:58:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41651 | An issue in Prestashop v.8.1.7 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the module upgrade functionality.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41651</link><description>An issue in Prestashop v.8.1.7 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the module upgrade functionality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 17:09:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42474 | Streamlit Path Traversal Security Vulnerability on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42474</link><description>Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python.

An attacker that can intercept traffic between client and server could drop certain packets from the stream, potentially causing client and server to consequently end up with a connection for which 
some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin 
attack

The mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented in Apache MINA SSHD 2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade to at least this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:27:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42489 | Pro Macros Remote Code Execution via Viewpdf and similar macros</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42489</link><description>Pro Macros provides XWiki rendering macros.

Improper neutralization of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `;` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary command injection is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity. It is recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:49:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42485 | Filament Excel Vulnerable to Path Traversal Attack on Export Download Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42485</link><description>Filament Excel enables excel export for Filament admin resources.

mm: huge_memory: use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines

Yves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 ("mm: huge_memory: don't
force huge page alignment on 32 bit") didn't work for x86_32 [1].  It is
because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.

!CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.

The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.

This issue is another instance of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in this case is from the integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD.

As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code execution as root.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 03:20:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7660 | SourceCodester File Manager App Add File cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7660</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester File Manager App 1.0 and classified as problematic.

When pf is configured to allow ND and block incoming Echo Requests, a crafted Echo Request packet after a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) can trigger an Echo Reply.  The packet has to come from the same host as the NS and have a zero as identifier to match the state created by the Neighbor Discovery and allow replies to be generated.

ICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall rules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going to create a state in the state table.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6759 | NFS client accepts file names containing path separators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6759</link><description>When mounting a remote filesystem using NFS, the kernel did not sanitize remotely provided filenames for the path separator character, "/".  This allows readdir(3) and related functions to return filesystem entries with names containing additional path components.

The lack of validation described above gives rise to a confused deputy problem.
