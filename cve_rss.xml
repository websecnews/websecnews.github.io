Although this would not be useful for attackers in most cases, if an administrator account becomes compromised this could be useful information to an attacker in a limited environment.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 03:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2337 | Easy Testimonials &amp;lt;= 3.9.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2337</link><description>The Easy Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'testimonials_grid ' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

TorchServe 's check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as ".." but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected. This issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as ".." before downloading see PR #3082. TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 01:36:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35199 | TorchServe gRPC Port Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35199</link><description>TorchServe is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production. In affected versions the two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/) by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces.
