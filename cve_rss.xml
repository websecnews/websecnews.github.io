When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.

allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

(.) Warning: jbuf pool id &lt;#&gt; utilization level (%) is above %!

To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.

A vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.  Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32381 | Denial of Service by abusing xgrammar unbounded cache in memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32381</link><description>XGrammar is an open-source library for efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation. Prior to 0.1.18, Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory. Since the cache is unbounded, a system making use of xgrammar can be abused to fill up a host's memory and case a denial of service. For example, sending many small requests to an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas would eventually cause this denial of service to occur. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.1.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32379 | XSS at ctx.redirect() function in Koajs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32379</link><description>Koa is expressive middleware for Node.js using ES2017 async functions.

This vulnerability affects confidential client applications, including daemons, web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information such as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely. Service logs generated at the information level or credential descriptions containing local file paths with passwords, Base64 encoded values, or Client secret. Additionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded certificates or certificate paths with password credential descriptions are also affected if the certificates are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials are not usable due to their invalid or expired status. To mitigate this vulnerability, update to Microsoft.Identity.Web 3.8.2 or Microsoft.Identity.Abstractions 9.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:57:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32378 | Shopware&amp;#x27;s default newsletter opt-in settings allow for mass sign-up abuse</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32378</link><description>Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform.

The issue affects the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with duplicate names (including the path) in the zip.

Multiple file upload functions within the HAX CMS PHP application call a ’save’ function in ’HAXCMSFile.php’. This save function uses a denylist to block specific file types from being uploaded to the server. This list is non-exhaustive and only blocks ’.php’, ’.sh’, ’.js’, and ’.css’ files. The existing logic causes the system to "fail open" rather than "fail closed."

In versions 0.45.0 through 0.48.6, the Cursor app introduced a regression affecting the set of file paths the Cursor Agent is permitted to modify automatically. Under specific conditions, the agent could be prompted, either directly by the user or via maliciously crafted context, to automatically write to files outside of the opened workspace. This behavior required deliberate prompting, making successful exploitation highly impractical in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the edited file was still displayed in the UI as usual for user review, making it unlikely for the edit to go unnoticed by the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 15:58:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32017 | Umbraco has a Management API Vulnerability to Path Traversal With Authenticated Users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32017</link><description>Umbraco is a free and open source .NET content management system.

read_answers()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31498</link><description>c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:09:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30150 | Shopware 6 allows attackers to check for registered accounts through the store-api</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30150</link><description>Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue.

Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"

There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a
given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups
and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,
but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).

This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where
likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate
for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which
often serves as a baseline for products).

Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.

KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state

There are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's
FPSIMD/SVE state, including:

* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent
  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to
  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by
  Eric Auger:

  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997

* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an
  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.

* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,
  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses
  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR
  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale
  value in memory.

Avoid these by eagerly saving and "flushing" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME
state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the
host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is
removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is
placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'
should not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be
removed in subsequent patches.

Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous
assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:

  8383741ab2e773a9 ("KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving")

... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL
stable trees.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22014 | soc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock

When some client process A call pdr_add_lookup() to add the look up for
the service and does schedule locator work, later a process B got a new
server packet indicating locator is up and call pdr_locator_new_server()
which eventually sets pdr-&gt;locator_init_complete to true which process A
sees and takes list lock and queries domain list but it will timeout due
to deadlock as the response will queued to the same qmi-&gt;wq and it is
ordered workqueue and process B is not able to complete new server
request work due to deadlock on list lock.

Fix it by removing the unnecessary list iteration as the list iteration
is already being done inside locator work, so avoid it here and just
call schedule_work() here.

       Process A                        Process B

                                     process_scheduled_works()

Timeout error log due to deadlock:

an audio regression when using the in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes it

mm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration

A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the
same time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio-&gt;mapping should be
NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.

In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to
update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page
cache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index
entry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during
xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using
folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache
entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/

Note:
In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() &amp;&amp; folio_test_swapcache() is
used to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in
swap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a
in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since
!folio_test_anon() is true and folio-&gt;mapping is NULL.  But fortunately,
its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY
when folio-&gt;mapping is NULL.  So no need to take care of it here.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:42:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22016 | dpll: fix xa_alloc_cyclic() error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22016</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
