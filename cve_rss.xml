Authorino allows the users with developer persona to add callbacks to be executed to HTTP endpoints once the authorization process is completed. It was found that an attacker with developer persona access can add a large number of those callbacks to be executed by Authorino and as the authentication policy is enforced by a single instance of the service, this leada to a Denial of Service in Authorino while processing the post-authorization callbacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:28:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25208 | Rhcl: authorino denial of service through authpolicy with sharedsecretref severity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25208</link><description>A Developer persona can bring down the Authorino service, preventing the evaluation of all AuthPolicies on the cluster</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:28:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25209 | Rhcl: sharedsecretref can be used to leak secrets severity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25209</link><description>The AuthPolicy metadata on Red Hat Connectivity Link contains an object which stores secretes, however it assumes those secretes are already in the kuadrant-system instead of copying it to the referred namespace. This creates space for a malicious actor with a developer persona access to leak those secrets over HTTP connection, as long the attacker knows the name of the targeted secrets and those secrets are limited to one line only.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:28:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3581 | Newsletter &amp;lt; 8.8.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Widget</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3581</link><description>The Newsletter  WordPress plugin before 8.8.5 does not validate and escape some of its Widget options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:28:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3582 | Newsletter &amp;lt; 8.8.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Form</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3582</link><description>The Newsletter  WordPress plugin before 8.85 does not sanitise and escape some of its Form settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:28:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47711 | Nbdkit: nbdkit-server: off-by-one error when processing block status may lead to a denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47711</link><description>There's a flaw in the nbdkit server when handling responses from its plugins regarding the status of data blocks.

can: bcm: add missing rcu read protection for procfs content

When the procfs content is generated for a bcm_op which is in the process
to be removed the procfs output might show unreliable data (UAF).

As the removal of bcm_op's is already implemented with rcu handling this
patch adds the missing rcu_read_lock() and makes sure the list entries
are properly removed under rcu protection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38004 | can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updates</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38004</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updates

The CAN broadcast manager (CAN BCM) can send a sequence of CAN frames via
hrtimer. The content and also the length of the sequence can be changed
resp reduced at runtime where the 'currframe' counter is then set to zero.

Although this appeared to be a safe operation the updates of 'currframe'
can be triggered from user space and hrtimer context in bcm_can_tx().
Anderson Nascimento created a proof of concept that triggered a KASAN
slab-out-of-bounds read access which can be prevented with a spin_lock_bh.

At the rework of bcm_can_tx() the 'count' variable has been moved into
the protected section as this variable can be modified from both contexts
too.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55585 | moPS App Engine 1.8.618 has incorrect access control.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55585</link><description>moPS App Engine 1.8.618 has incorrect access control.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 19:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5840 | SourceCodester Client Database Management System user_update_customer_order.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5840</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0.
