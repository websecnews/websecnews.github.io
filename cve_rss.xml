When a user changes their password, the existing list of Access Tokens stay valid instead of expiring. If a user finds that their account has been compromised, they can update their password. In versions up to and including 0.18.1, though, the bad actor will still have access to their account because the bad actor's Access Token stays on the list as a valid token. The user will have to manually delete the bad actor's Access Token to secure their account. The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description which makes it hard to pinpoint a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens. A known patched version of Memos isn't available. To improve Memos security, all Access Tokens will need to be revoked when a user changes their password. This removes the session for all the user's devices and prompts the user to log in again. One can treat the old Access Tokens as "invalid" because those Access Tokens were created with the older password.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:25:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12149 | Unauthorized access to documents protected by Document-Level Security (DLS), when Signal&amp;#x27;s watches include a search query involving protected documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12149</link><description>In Search Guard FLX versions 3.1.2 and earlier, while Document-Level Security (DLS) is correctly enforced elsewhere, when the search is trigged from a Signal's watch, the DLS rule is not enforced, allowing access to all documents in the queried indices.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:25:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11918 | Rockwell Automation Arena® Simulation Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11918</link><description>Rockwell Automation Arena® suffers from a

A vulnerability in versions of Apollo Federation's composition logic prior to 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 allowed some queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface types/fields, which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object types/fields in Apollo Router via inline fragments, for example. A fix to versions 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 of composition logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined access control directives. Some workarounds are available. Users of Apollo Rover with an unpatched composition version or are using the Apollo Studio build pipeline with Federation version 2.8 or below should manually copy the access control requirements on interface types/fields to each implementing object type/field where appropriate. Do not remove those access control requirements from the interface types/fields, as unpatched Apollo Composition will not automatically generate them in the supergraph schema. Customers not using Apollo Router access control features (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives) or not specifying access control requirements on interface types/fields are not affected and do not need to take action.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13130 | Radarr Service Radarr.Console.exe default permission</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13130</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Radarr 5.28.0.10274.

The impacted element is an unknown function of the file C:\ProgramData\Sonarr\bin\Sonarr.Console.exe of the component Service. Performing manipulation results in incorrect default permissions. The attack is only possible with local access. The vendor confirms this vulnerability but classifies it as a "low severity issue due to the default service user being used as it would either require someone to intentionally change the service to a highly privileged account or an attacker would need an admin level account". It is planned to fix this issue in the next major release v5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36096 | AIX Insufficiently Protected Credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36096</link><description>IBM AIX 7.2, and 7.3 and IBM VIOS 3.1, and 4.1 stores NIM private keys used in NIM environments in an insecure way which is susceptible to unauthorized access by an attacker using man in the middle techniques.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36236 | AIX Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36236</link><description>IBM AIX 7.2, and 7.3 and IBM VIOS 3.1, and 4.1 NIM server (formerly known as NIM master) service (nimesis) could allow a remote attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 21:34:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47221 | Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 2 of 3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47221</link><description>Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 2 of 3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 21:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47222 | Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 3 of 3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47222</link><description>Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 3 of 3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 21:19:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47220 | Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 1 of 3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47220</link><description>Keyfactor SignServer before 7.3.1 has Incorrect Access Control, issue 1 of 3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64746 | Directus has Improper Permission Handling on Deleted Fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64746</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.13.0, Directus does not properly clean up field-level permissions when a field is deleted. When a field is removed from a collection, its reference in the permissions table remains intact. This stale reference creates a security gap: if another field is later created using the same name, it inherits the outdated permission entry. This behavior can unintentionally grant roles access to data they should not be able to read or modify. The issue is particularly risky in multi-tenant or production environments, where administrators may reuse field names, assuming old permissions have been fully cleared. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4619 | PAN-OS: Firewall Denial of Service (DoS) Using Specially Crafted Packets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4619</link><description>A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an unauthenticated attacker to reboot a firewall by sending a specially crafted packet through the dataplane.

Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.15.6, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Astro's development server error pages when the `trailingSlash` configuration option is used. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context by crafting a malicious URL. While this vulnerability only affects the development server and not production builds, it could be exploited to compromise developer environments through social engineering or malicious links. Version 5.15.6 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:35:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64726 | External Control of System or Configuration Setting and Uncontrolled Search Path Element in sfw</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64726</link><description>Socket Firewall is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server that intercepts package manager requests and enforces security policies by blocking dangerous packages. Socket Firewall binary versions (separate from installers) prior to 0.15.5 are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when run in untrusted project directories. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious `.sfw.config` file in a project directory. When a developer runs Socket Firewall commands (e.g., `sfw npm install`) in that directory, the tool loads the `.sfw.config` file and populates environment variables directly into the Node.js process. An attacker can exploit this by setting `NODE_OPTIONS` with a `--require` directive to execute malicious JavaScript code before Socket Firewall's security controls are initialized, effectively bypassing the tool's malicious package detection. The attack vector is indirect and requires a developer to install dependencies for an untrusted project and execute a command within the context of the untrusted project. The vulnerability has been patched in Socket Firewall version 0.15.5. Users should upgrade to version 0.15.5 or later. The fix isolates configuration file values from subprocess environments. Look at `sfw --version` for version information. If users rely on the recommended installation mechanism (e.g. global installation via `npm install -g sfw`) then no workaround is necessary. This wrapper package automatically ensures that users are running the latest version of Socket Firewall. Users who have manually installed the binary and cannot immediately upgrade should avoid running Socket Firewall in untrusted project directories. Before running Socket Firewall in any new project, inspect `.sfw.config` and `.env.local` files for suspicious `NODE_OPTIONS` or other environment variable definitions that reference local files.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:13:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59840 | Vega Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via expressions abusing toString calls in environments using the VEGA_DEBUG global variable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59840</link><description>Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 6.2.0, applications meeting 2 conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. They are vulnerable if they use `vega` in an application that attaches `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window` and if they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). Patches are available in the following Vega applications. If using the latest Vega line (6.x), upgrade to `vega` `6.2.0` / `vega-expression` `6.1.0` / `vega-interpreter`  `2.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). If using Vega in a non-ESM environment, upgrade to `vega-expression` `5.2.1` / `1.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). Some workarounds are available. Do not attach `vega` View instances to global variables, and do not attach `vega` to the global window. These practices of attaching the vega library and View instances may be convenient for debugging, but should not be used in production or in any situation where vega/vega-lite definitions could be provided by untrusted parties.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:13:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-4984 | ZenTao Biz &amp;lt; 6.5, Max &amp;lt; 3.0, &amp;amp; Open Source Edition 16.5/16.5beta1 SQL Injection via user-login.html</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4984</link><description>ZenTao Biz &lt; 6.5, ZenTao Max &lt; 3.0, ZenTao Open Source Edition &lt; 16.5, and ZenTao Open Source Edition &lt; 16.5.beta1 contain an SQL injection vulnerability in the login functionality.

Starting in version 2.50.0 and prior to versions 2.71.19, 3.4.4, and 4.6.6, a vulnerability in ZITADEL's federation process allowed auto-linking users from external identity providers to existing users in ZITADEL even if the corresponding IdP was not active or if the organization did not allow federated authentication. This vulnerability stems from the platform's failure to correctly check or enforce an organization's specific security settings during the authentication flow. An Organization Administrator can explicitly disable an IdP or disallow federation, but this setting was not being honored during the auto-linking process. This allowed an unauthenticated attacker to initiate a login using an IdP that should have been disabled for that organization. The platform would incorrectly validate the login and, based on a matching criteria, link the attacker's external identity to an existing internal user account. This may result in a full Account Takeover, bypassing the organization's mandated security controls. Note that accounts with MFA enabled can not be taken over by this attack. Also note that only IdPs create on an instance level would allow this to work. IdPs registered on another organization would always be denied in the (auto-)linking process. Versions 4.6.6, 3.4.4, and 2.71.19 resolve the issue by correctly validating the organization's login policy before auto-linking an external user.

All users who parse untrusted yaml documents may be impacted. The problem is patched in js-yaml 4.1.1. Users can protect against this kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution protection is on by default).</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52186 | Lichess lila before commit 11b4c0fb00f0ffd823246f839627005459c8f05c (2025-06-02) contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-52186</link><description>Lichess lila before commit 11b4c0fb00f0ffd823246f839627005459c8f05c (2025-06-02) contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the game export API.

Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3, an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion exists in the template-switching feature. If `templateselection` is enabled in the configuration, the server trusts the `template` cookie and includes the referenced PHP file. An attacker can read sensitive data or, if they manage to drop a PHP file elsewhere, gain remote code execution. The constructed path of the template file is checked for existence, then included. For PrivateBin project files this does not leak any secrets due to data files being created with PHP code that prevents execution, but if a configuration file without that line got created or the visitor figures out the relative path to a PHP script that directly performs an action without appropriate privilege checking, those might execute or leak information. The issue has been patched in version 2.0.3. As a workaround, set `templateselection = false` (which is the default) in `cfg/conf.php` or remove it entirely</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:34:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62484 | Zoom Workplace Clients - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62484</link><description>Inefficient regular expression complexity in certain Zoom Workplace Clients before version 6.5.10 may allow an unauthenticated user to conduct an escalation of privilege via network access.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:34:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13118 | macrozheng mall-swarm paySuccess improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13118</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in macrozheng mall-swarm up to 1.0.3.

Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3, dragging a file whose filename contains HTML is reflected verbatim into the page via the drag-and-drop helper, so any user who drops a crafted file on PrivateBin will execute arbitrary JavaScript within their own session (self-XSS). This allows an attacker who can entice a victim to drag or otherwise attach such a file to exfiltrate plaintext, encryption keys, or stored pastes before they are encrypted or sent. Certain conditions must exist for the vulnerability to be exploitable. Only macOS or Linux users are affected, due to the way the `&gt;` character is treated in a file name on Windows. The PrivateBin instance needs to have file upload enabled. An attacker needs to have access to the local file system or somehow convince the user to create (or download) a malicious file (name). An attacker needs to convince the user to attach that malicious file to PrivateBin. Any Mac / Linux user who can be tricked into dragging a maliciously named file into the editor is impacted; code runs in the origin of the PrivateBin instance they are using. Attackers can steal plaintext, passphrases, or manipulate the UI before data is encrypted, defeating the zero-knowledge guarantees for that victim session, assuming counter-measures like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) have been disabled. If CSP is not disabled, HTML injection attacks may be possible - like redirecting to a foreign website, phishing etc. As the whole exploit needs to be included in the file name of the attached file and only affects the local session of the user (aka it is neither persistent nor remotely executable) and that user needs to interact and actively attach that file to the paste, the impact is considered to be practically low. Version 2.0.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 03:18:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64716 | Anubis vulnerable to possible XSS via redir parameter when using subrequest auth mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64716</link><description>Anubis is a Web AI Firewall Utility that challenges users' connections in order to protect upstream resources from scraper bots.

In cups-filters prior to 1.28.18, by crafting a PDF file with a large `MediaBox` value, an attacker can cause CUPS-Filter 1.x’s `pdftoraster` tool to write beyond the bounds of an array. First, a PDF with a large `MediaBox` width value causes `header.cupsWidth` to become large.  Next, the calculation of `bytesPerLine = (header.cupsBitsPerPixel * header.cupsWidth + 7) / 8` overflows, resulting in a small value. Then, `lineBuf` is allocated with the small `bytesPerLine` size. Finally, `convertLineChunked` calls `writePixel8`, which attempts to write to `lineBuf` outside of its buffer size (out of bounds write). In libcupsfilters, the maintainers found the same `bytesPerLine` multiplication without overflow check, but the provided test case does not cause an overflow there, because the values are different.

With `Defaults targetpw` (or `Defaults rootpw`) enabled,  the password of the target account (or root account) instead of the invoking user is used for authentication. sudo-rs starting in version 0.2.5 and prior to version 0.2.10 incorrectly recorded the invoking user’s UID instead of the authenticated-as user's UID in the authentication timestamp. Any later `sudo` invocation on the same terminal while the timestamp was still valid would use that timestamp, potentially bypassing new authentication even if the policy would have required it. A highly-privileged user (able to run commands as other users, or as root, through sudo) who knows one password of an account they are allowed to run commands as, would be able to run commands as any other account the policy permits them to run commands for, even if they don't know the password for those accounts. A common instance of this would be that a user can still use their own password to run commands as root (the default behaviour of `sudo`), effectively negating the intended behaviour of the `targetpw` or `rootpw` options. Version 0.2.10 contains a patch for the issue. Versions prior to 0.2.5 are not affected, since they do not offer `Defaults targetpw` or `Defaults rootpw`.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40178 | pid: Add a judgment for ns null in pid_nr_ns</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40178</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However orphan replay
needs to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus
filesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of
memory consumed. Limit orphan file size to a sane value and also use
kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid
large order allocations for sane but large orphan files.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40180 | mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix out-of-bounds access in mailbox cleanup loop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40180</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/kvm: Force legacy PCI hole to UC when overriding MTRRs for TDX/SNP

When running as an SNP or TDX guest under KVM, force the legacy PCI hole,
i.e. memory between Top of Lower Usable DRAM and 4GiB, to be mapped as UC
via a forced variable MTRR range.

In most KVM-based setups, legacy devices such as the HPET and TPM are
enumerated via ACPI.  ACPI enumeration includes a Memory32Fixed entry, and
optionally a SystemMemory descriptor for an OperationRegion, e.g. if the
device needs to be accessed via a Control Method.

If a SystemMemory entry is present, then the kernel's ACPI driver will
auto-ioremap the region so that it can be accessed at will.  However, the
ACPI spec doesn't provide a way to enumerate the memory type of
SystemMemory regions, i.e. there's no way to tell software that a region
must be mapped as UC vs. WB, etc.  As a result, Linux's ACPI driver always
maps SystemMemory regions using ioremap_cache(), i.e. as WB on x86.

The dedicated device drivers however, e.g. the HPET driver and TPM driver,
want to map their associated memory as UC or WC, as accessing PCI devices
using WB is unsupported.

On bare metal and non-CoCO, the conflicting requirements "work" as firmware
configures the PCI hole (and other device memory) to be UC in the MTRRs.
So even though the ACPI mappings request WB, they are forced to UC- in the
kernel's tracking due to the kernel properly handling the MTRR overrides,
and thus are compatible with the drivers' requested WC/UC-.

With force WB MTRRs on SNP and TDX guests, the ACPI mappings get their
requested WB if the ACPI mappings are established before the dedicated
driver code attempts to initialize the device.  E.g. if acpi_init()
runs before the corresponding device driver is probed, ACPI's WB mapping
will "win", and result in the driver's ioremap() failing because the
existing WB mapping isn't compatible with the requested WC/UC-.

E.g. when a TPM is emulated by the hypervisor (ignoring the security
implications of relying on what is allegedly an untrusted entity to store
measurements), the TPM driver will request UC and fail:

  [  1.730459] ioremap error for 0xfed40000-0xfed45000, requested 0x2, got 0x0
  [  1.732780] tpm_tis MSFT0101:00: probe with driver tpm_tis failed with error -12

Note, the '0x2' and '0x0' values refer to "enum page_cache_mode", not x86's
memtypes (which frustratingly are an almost pure inversion; 2 == WB, 0 == UC).
E.g. tracing mapping requests for TPM TIS yields:

 Mapping TPM TIS with req_type = 0

crypto: skcipher - Fix reqsize handling

Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg")
introduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type
specific reqsize fields. It looks like this was introduced specifically
for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent commits
add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.

However, this is being recommended for use in all crypto algs [1]
instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
cra_reqsize in skcipher algorithms, hence, causes memory
corruptions and crashes as the underlying functions in the algorithm
framework have not been updated to set the reqsize properly from
cra_reqsize. [2]

Add proper set_reqsize calls in the skcipher init function to
properly initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.

bpf: Fix metadata_dst leak __bpf_redirect_neigh_v{4,6}

Cilium has a BPF egress gateway feature which forces outgoing K8s Pod
traffic to pass through dedicated egress gateways which then SNAT the
traffic in order to interact with stable IPs outside the cluster.

The traffic is directed to the gateway via vxlan tunnel in collect md
mode. A recent BPF change utilized the bpf_redirect_neigh() helper to
forward packets after the arrival and decap on vxlan, which turned out
over time that the kmalloc-256 slab usage in kernel was ever-increasing.

The issue was that vxlan allocates the metadata_dst object and attaches
it through a fake dst entry to the skb. The latter was never released
though given bpf_redirect_neigh() was merely setting the new dst entry
via skb_dst_set() without dropping an existing one first.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40184 | KVM: arm64: Fix debug checking for np-guests using huge mappings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40184</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Fix debug checking for np-guests using huge mappings

When running with transparent huge pages and CONFIG_NVHE_EL2_DEBUG then
the debug checking in assert_host_shared_guest() fails on the launch of an
np-guest. This WARN_ON() causes a panic and generates the stack below.

In __pkvm_host_relax_perms_guest() the debug checking assumes the mapping
is a single page but it may be a block map. Update the checking so that
the size is not checked and just assumes the correct size.

While we're here make the same fix in __pkvm_host_mkyoung_guest().

ice: ice_adapter: release xa entry on adapter allocation failure

When ice_adapter_new() fails, the reserved XArray entry created by
xa_insert() is not released. This causes subsequent insertions at
the same index to return -EBUSY, potentially leading to
NULL pointer dereferences.

Reorder the operations as suggested by Przemek Kitszel:
1. Check if adapter already exists (xa_load)
2. Reserve the XArray slot (xa_reserve)
3. Allocate the adapter (ice_adapter_new)
4. Store the adapter (xa_store)</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40186 | tcp: Don&amp;#x27;t call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40186</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Don't call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request().

syzbot reported the splat below in tcp_conn_request(). [0]

If a listener is close()d while a TFO socket is being processed in
tcp_conn_request(), inet_csk_reqsk_queue_add() does not set reqsk-&gt;sk
and calls inet_child_forget(), which calls tcp_disconnect() for the
TFO socket.

After the cited commit, tcp_disconnect() calls reqsk_fastopen_remove(),
where reqsk_put() is called due to !reqsk-&gt;sk.

Then, reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request() decrements the
last req-&gt;rsk_refcnt and frees reqsk, and __reqsk_free() at the
drop_and_free label causes the refcount underflow for the listener
and double-free of the reqsk.

Let's remove reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_conn_request().

Note that other callers make sure tp-&gt;fastopen_rsk is not NULL.

The function lan78xx_read_raw_eeprom failed to properly propagate EEPROM
read timeout errors (-ETIMEDOUT). In the fallthrough path, it first
attempted to restore the pin configuration for LED outputs and then
returned only the status of that restore operation, discarding the
original timeout error.

As a result, callers could mistakenly treat the data buffer as valid
even though the EEPROM read had actually timed out with no data or partial
data.

To fix this, handle errors in restoring the LED pin configuration separately.
If the restore succeeds, return any prior EEPROM timeout error correctly
to the caller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40190 | ext4: guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40190</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update

syzkaller found a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA
inode refcount that is already &lt;= 0 and then applies ref_change (often
-1). That lets the refcount underflow and we proceed with a bogus value,
triggering errors like:

  EXT4-fs error: EA inode  ref underflow: ref_count=-1 ref_change=-1
  EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err=-117

Make the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive,
treat this as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the
operation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount. Delete the
WARN_ONCE() as negative refcounts are now impossible; keep error reporting
in ext4_error_inode().

This prevents the underflow and the follow-on orphan/cleanup churn.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40191 | drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd process ref leaking when userptr unmapping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40191</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

indirectly accesses the policy object in question through the QoS request
object passed to it.

Fortunately, update_qos_request() is called under intel_pstate_driver_lock,
so this issue does not matter for changing the intel_pstate operation
mode, but it theoretically can cause a crash to occur on CPU device hot
removal (which currently can only happen in virt, but it is formally
supported nevertheless).

Address this issue by modifying update_qos_request() to drop the

fs: quota: create dedicated workqueue for quota_release_work

There is a kernel panic due to WARN_ONCE when panic_on_warn is set.

This issue occurs when writeback is triggered due to sync call for an
opened file(ie, writeback reason is WB_REASON_SYNC). When f2fs balance
is needed at sync path, flush for quota_release_work is triggered.
By default quota_release_work is queued to "events_unbound" queue which
does not have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag. During f2fs balance "writeback"
workqueue tries to flush quota_release_work causing kernel panic due to
MEM_RECLAIM flag mismatch errors.

This patch creates dedicated workqueue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag
for work quota_release_work.

page_pool: Fix PP_MAGIC_MASK to avoid crashing on some 32-bit arches

Helge reported that the introduction of PP_MAGIC_MASK let to crashes on
boot on his 32-bit parisc machine. The cause of this is the mask is set
too wide, so the page_pool_page_is_pp() incurs false positives which
crashes the machine.

Just disabling the check in page_pool_is_pp() will lead to the page_pool
code itself malfunctioning; so instead of doing this, this patch changes
the define for PP_DMA_INDEX_BITS to avoid mistaking arbitrary kernel
pointers for page_pool-tagged pages.

The fix relies on the kernel pointers that alias with the pp_magic field
always being above PAGE_OFFSET. With this assumption, we can use the
lowest bit of the value of PAGE_OFFSET as the upper bound of the
PP_DMA_INDEX_MASK, which should avoid the false positives.

Because we cannot rely on PAGE_OFFSET always being a compile-time
constant, nor on it always being &gt;0, we fall back to disabling the
dma_index storage when there are not enough bits available. This leaves
us in the situation we were in before the patch in the Fixes tag, but
only on a subset of architecture configurations. This seems to be the
best we can do until the transition to page types in complete for
page_pool pages.

v2:
- Make sure there's at least 8 bits available and that the PAGE_OFFSET
  bit calculation doesn't wrap</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40200 | Squashfs: reject negative file sizes in squashfs_read_inode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40200</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The usage of task_lock(tsk-&gt;group_leader) in sys_prlimit64()-&gt;do_prlimit()
path is very broken.

sys_prlimit64() does get_task_struct(tsk) but this only protects task_struct
itself. If tsk != current and tsk is not a leader, this process can exit/exec
and task_lock(tsk-&gt;group_leader) may use the already freed task_struct.

Another problem is that sys_prlimit64() can race with mt-exec which changes
-&gt;group_leader. In this case do_prlimit() may take the wrong lock, or (worse)
-&gt;group_leader may change between task_lock() and task_unlock().

Change sys_prlimit64() to take tasklist_lock when necessary. This is not
nice, but I don't see a better fix for -stable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40202 | ipmi: Rework user message limit handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40202</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: avoid potential out-of-bounds in btrfs_encode_fh()

The function btrfs_encode_fh() does not properly account for the three
cases it handles.

Before writing to the file handle (fh), the function only returns to the
user BTRFS_FID_SIZE_NON_CONNECTABLE (5 dwords, 20 bytes) or
BTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE (8 dwords, 32 bytes).

However, when a parent exists and the root ID of the parent and the
inode are different, the function writes BTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE_ROOT
(10 dwords, 40 bytes).

If *max_len is not large enough, this write goes out of bounds because
BTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE_ROOT is greater than
BTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE originally returned.

This results in an 8-byte out-of-bounds write at
fid-&gt;parent_root_objectid = parent_root_id.

A previous attempt to fix this issue was made but was lost.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/4CADAEEC020000780001B32C@vpn.id2.novell.com/

Although this issue does not seem to be easily triggerable, it is a
potential memory corruption bug that should be fixed. This patch
resolves the issue by ensuring the function returns the appropriate size
for all three cases and validates that *max_len is large enough before
writing any data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:16:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40206 | netfilter: nft_objref: validate objref and objrefmap expressions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40206</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Implement objref and objrefmap expression validate functions.

Currently, only NFT_OBJECT_SYNPROXY object type requires validation.
This will also handle a jump to a chain using a synproxy object from the
OUTPUT hook.

Now when trying to reference a synproxy object in the OUTPUT hook, nft
will produce the following error:

media: v4l2-subdev: Fix alloc failure check in v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()

v4l2_subdev_call_state_try() macro allocates a subdev state with
__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc(), but does not check the returned value. If
__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc fails, it returns an ERR_PTR, and that would

Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:47:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64429 | DuckDB Encryption Crypto implementation is vulnerable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64429</link><description>DuckDB is a SQL database management system. DuckDB implemented block-based encryption of DB on the filesystem starting with DuckDB 1.4.0. There are a few issues related to this implementation. The DuckDB can fall back to an insecure random number generator (pcg32) to generate cryptographic keys or IVs. When clearing keys from memory, the compiler may remove the memset() and leave sensitive data on the heap. By modifying the database header, an attacker could downgrade the encryption mode from GCM to CTR to bypass integrity checks. There may be a failure to check return value on call to OpenSSL `rand_bytes()`. An attacker could use public IVs to compromise the internal state of RNG and determine the randomly generated key used to encrypt temporary files, get access to cryptographic keys if they have access to process memory (e.g. through memory leak),circumvent GCM integrity checks, and/or influence the OpenSSL random number generator and DuckDB would not be able to detect a failure of the generator. Version 1.4.2 has disabled the insecure random number generator by no longer using the fallback to write to or create databases. Instead, DuckDB will now attempt to install and load the OpenSSL implementation in the `httpfs` extension. DuckDB now uses secure MbedTLS primitive to clear memory as recommended and requires explicit specification of ciphers without integrity checks like CTR on `ATTACH`. Additionally, DuckDB now checks the return code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:38:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64482 | Tuleap missing CSRF protections in the File Release System</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64482</link><description>Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration.

Prior to version 38.0.4, 37.0.3, 36.0.3, and 24.0.5, Wasmtime's Rust embedder API contains an unsound interaction where a WebAssembly shared linear memory could be viewed as a type which provides safe access to the host (Rust) to the contents of the linear memory. This is not sound for shared linear memories, which could be modified in parallel, and this could lead to a data race in the host. Patch releases have been issued for all supported versions of Wasmtime, notably: 24.0.5, 36.0.3, 37.0.3, and 38.0.4. These releases reject creation of shared memories via `Memory::new` and shared memories are now excluded from core dumps. As a workaround, eembeddings affected by this issue should use `SharedMemory::new` instead of `Memory::new` to create shared memories. Affected embeddings should also disable core dumps if they are unable to upgrade. Note that core dumps are disabled by default but the wasm threads proposal (and shared memory) is enabled by default.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:38:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-33119 | IBM QRadar SIEM Information Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-33119</link><description>IBM QRadar Security Information and Event Management 7.5 through 7.5.0 UP14 stores user credentials in configuration files in source control which can be read by an autheciated user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:25:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13063 | DinukaNavaratna Dee Store authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13063</link><description>A flaw has been found in DinukaNavaratna Dee Store 1.0.

A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache, and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 20:42:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46608 | Dell Data Lakehouse, versions prior to 1.6.0.0, contain(s) an Improper Access Control vulnerability.

In versions prior to 16.0.0, if the "claims_parameter_supported" parameter is activated, it is possible, thanks to the "oidc-claims-extension.groovy" script, to inject the value of one's choice into a claim contained in the id_token or in the user_info. In the request of an authorize function, a claims parameter containing a JSON file can be injected. This JSON file allows attackers to customize the claims returned by the "id_token" and "user_info" files. This allows for a very wide range of vulnerabilities depending on how clients use claims. For example, if some clients rely on an email field to identify a user, an attacker can choose the email address they want, and therefore assume any identity they choose. Version 16.0.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 19:15:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61667 | Datadog Linux Host Agent affected by local privilege escalation due to insufficient pycache permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61667</link><description>The Datadog Agent collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog. A vulnerability within the Datadog Linux Host Agent versions 7.65.0 through 7.70.2 exists due to insufficient permissions being set on the `opt/datadog-agent/python-scripts/__pycache__` directory during installation. Code in this directory is only run by the Agent during Agent install/upgrades.  This could allow an attacker with local access to modify files in this directory, which would then subsequently be run when the Agent is upgraded, resulting in local privilege escalation. This issue requires local access to the host and a valid low privilege account to be vulnerable. Note that this vulnerability only impacts the Linux Host Agent. Other variations of the Agent including the container, kubernetes, windows host and other agents are not impacted. Version 7.71.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:56:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63929 | A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in airpig2011 IEC104 thru Commit be6d841 (2019-07-08).

In CUPS-Filters versions up to and including 1.28.17 and libscupsfilters versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.1, CUPS-Filters's `imagetoraster` filter has an out of bounds read/write vulnerability in the processing of TIFF image files.  While the pixel buffer is allocated with the number of pixels times a pre-calculated bytes-per-pixel value, the function which processes these pixels is called with a size of the number of pixels times 3.  When suitable inputs are passed, the bytes-per-pixel value can be set to 1 and bytes outside of the buffer bounds get processed. In order to trigger the bug, an attacker must issue a print job with a crafted TIFF file, and pass appropriate print job options to control the bytes-per-pixel value of the output format. They must choose a printer configuration under which the `imagetoraster` filter or its C-function equivalent `cfFilterImageToRaster()` gets invoked. The vulnerability exists in both CUPS-Filters 1.x and the successor library libcupsfilters (CUPS-Filters 2.x). In CUPS-Filters 2.x, the vulnerable function is `_cfImageReadTIFF() in libcupsfilters`. When this function is invoked as part of `cfFilterImageToRaster()`, the caller passes a look-up-table during whose processing the out of bounds memory access happens. In CUPS-Filters 1.x, the equivalent functions are all found in the cups-filters repository, which is not split into subprojects yet, and the vulnerable code is in `_cupsImageReadTIFF()`, which is called through `cupsImageOpen()` from the `imagetoraster` tool. A patch is available in commit b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:56:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63927 | A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in airpig2011 IEC104 thru Commit be6d841 (2019-07-08).

While receiving the KDC's response, kdcproxy copies the entire buffered stream into a new
buffer on each recv() call, even when the transfer is incomplete, causing excessive memory allocation and CPU usage. Additionally, kdcproxy accepts incoming response chunks as long as the received data length is not exactly equal to the length indicated in the response
header, even when individual chunks or the total buffer exceed the maximum length of a Kerberos message. This allows an attacker to send unbounded data until the connection timeout is reached (approximately 12 seconds), exhausting server memory or CPU resources. Multiple concurrent requests can cause accept queue overflow, denying service to legitimate clients.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:01:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2843 | Observability-operator: observability operator privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2843</link><description>A flaw was found in the Observability Operator.

SKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.
However, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is

Add a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB

bpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops

When verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates
instructions with ALU operations. The 'offset' field in these
instructions is a signed 16-bit integer.

The existing check 'insn-&gt;off &gt; 1' was intended to ensure the offset is
either 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV. However, because 'insn-&gt;off' is
signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1).

This commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to
'(insn-&gt;off != 0 &amp;&amp; insn-&gt;off != 1)'. This ensures that any value
other than the explicitly permitted 0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the
verifier against malformed BPF programs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40170 | net: use dst_dev_rcu() in sk_setup_caps()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40170</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc: Check GuC running state before deregistering exec queue

In normal operation, a registered exec queue is disabled and
deregistered through the GuC, and freed only after the GuC confirms
completion. However, if the driver is forced to unbind while the exec
queue is still running, the user may call exec_destroy() after the GuC
has already been stopped and CT communication disabled.

In this case, the driver cannot receive a response from the GuC,
preventing proper cleanup of exec queue resources. Fix this by directly
releasing the resources when GuC is not running.

Here is the failure dmesg log:

ext4: detect invalid INLINE_DATA + EXTENTS flag combination

syzbot reported a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() when opening a verity
file on a corrupted ext4 filesystem mounted without a journal.

The issue is that the filesystem has an inode with both the INLINE_DATA
and EXTENTS flags set:

    EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_cache_extents:545: inode #15:
    comm syz.0.17: corrupted extent tree: lblk 0 &lt; prev 66

Investigation revealed that the inode has both flags set:
    DEBUG: inode 15 - flag=1, i_inline_off=164, has_inline=1, extents_flag=1

This is an invalid combination since an inode should have either:
- INLINE_DATA: data stored directly in the inode
- EXTENTS: data stored in extent-mapped blocks

Having both flags causes ext4_has_inline_data() to return true, skipping
extent tree validation in __ext4_iget(). The unvalidated out-of-order
extents then trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() due to integer
underflow when calculating hole sizes.

Fix this by detecting this invalid flag combination early in ext4_iget()
and rejecting the corrupted inode.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:48:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40112 | sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for Niagara</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40112</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: qcom: pas: Shutdown lite ADSP DTB on X1E

The ADSP firmware on X1E has separate firmware binaries for the main
firmware and the DTB. The same applies for the "lite" firmware loaded by
the boot firmware.

When preparing to load the new ADSP firmware we shutdown the lite_pas_id
for the main firmware, but we don't shutdown the corresponding lite pas_id
for the DTB. The fact that we're leaving it "running" forever becomes
obvious if you try to reuse (or just access) the memory region used by the
"lite" firmware: The &amp;amp;adsp_boot_mem is accessible, but accessing the
&amp;amp;adsp_boot_dtb_mem results in a crash.

We don't support reusing the memory regions currently, but nevertheless we
should not keep part of the lite firmware running. Fix this by adding the
lite_dtb_pas_id and shutting it down as well.

We don't have a way to detect if the lite firmware is actually running yet,
so ignore the return status of qcom_scm_pas_shutdown() for now. This was
already the case before, the assignment to "ret" is not used anywhere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40115 | scsi: mpt3sas: Fix crash in transport port remove by using ioc_info()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod

Since commit f7b705c238d1 ("scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached to zero when
device is gone") UBSAN reports:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17
  index 28 is out of range for type 'pm8001_phy [16]'

on rmmod when using an expander.

For a direct attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id.
For a device behind an expander, attached_phy contains the remote phy
id, not the local phy id.

I.e. while pm8001_ha will have pm8001_ha-&gt;chip-&gt;n_phy local phys, for a
device behind an expander, attached_phy can be much larger than
pm8001_ha-&gt;chip-&gt;n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the
expander).

E.g. on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the
ports has an expander connected.  The expander has 31 phys with phy ids
0-30.

The pm8001_ha-&gt;phy array only contains the phys of the HBA.  It does not
contain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy
to index the pm8001_ha-&gt;phy array for a device behind an expander.

Thus, we can only clear phy_attached for devices that are directly
attached.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40119 | ext4: fix potential null deref in ext4_mb_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40119</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix: hold PM usage ref to avoid PM/MDIO + RTNL deadlock

Prevent USB runtime PM (autosuspend) for AX88772* in bind.

usbnet enables runtime PM (autosuspend) by default, so disabling it via
the usb_driver flag is ineffective. On AX88772B, autosuspend shows no
measurable power saving with current driver (no link partner, admin
up/down). The ~0.453 W -&gt; ~0.248 W drop on v6.1 comes from phylib powering
the PHY off on admin-down, not from USB autosuspend.

The real hazard is that with runtime PM enabled, ndo_open() (under RTNL)
may synchronously trigger autoresume (usb_autopm_get_interface()) into
asix_resume() while the USB PM lock is held. Resume paths then invoke
phylink/phylib and MDIO, which also expect RTNL, leading to possible
deadlocks or PM lock vs MDIO wake issues.

To avoid this, keep the device runtime-PM active by taking a usage
reference in ax88772_bind() and dropping it in unbind(). A non-zero PM
usage count blocks runtime suspend regardless of userspace policy
(.../power/control - pm_runtime_allow/forbid), making this approach
robust against sysfs overrides.

Holding a runtime-PM usage ref does not affect system-wide suspend;
system sleep/resume callbacks continue to run as before.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40121 | ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix invalid quirk input mapping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40121</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

On PTL, GP counter 0 and 1 doesn't support auto counter reload feature,
thus it would trigger a #GP when trying to write 1 on bit 0 of CFG_B MSR
which requires to enable auto counter reload on GP counter 0.

The root cause of causing this issue is the check for auto counter
reload (ACR) counter mask from user space is incorrect in
intel_pmu_acr_late_setup() helper. It leads to an invalid ACR counter
mask from user space could be set into hw.config1 and then written into
CFG_B MSRs and trigger the MSR access warning.

e.g., User may create a perf event with ACR counter mask (config2=0xcb),
and there is only 1 event created, so "cpuc-&gt;n_events" is 1.

The correct check condition should be "i + idx &gt;= cpuc-&gt;n_events"
instead of "i + idx &gt; cpuc-&gt;n_events" (it looks a typo). Otherwise,
the counter mask would traverse twice and an invalid "cpuc-&gt;assign[1]"
bit (bit 0) is set into hw.config1 and cause MSR accessing error.

Besides, also check if the ACR counter mask corresponding events are
ACR events. If not, filter out these counter mask. If a event is not a
ACR event, it could be scheduled to an HW counter which doesn't support
ACR. It's invalid to add their counter index in ACR counter mask.

Furthermore, remove the WARN_ON_ONCE() since it's easily triggered as
user could set any invalid ACR counter mask and the warning message
could mislead users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40123 | bpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40123</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility

Yinhao et al. recently reported:

  Our fuzzer tool discovered an uninitialized pointer issue in the
  bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() function within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.
  This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when a BPF program attempts to
  deference the txq member of struct xdp_buff object.

The test initializes two programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP: progA acts as the
entry point for bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() and its expected_attach_type can
neither be of be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP nor BPF_XDP_CPUMAP. progA calls into a slot
of a tailcall map it owns. progB's expected_attach_type must be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP
to pass xdp_is_valid_access() validation. The program returns struct xdp_md's
egress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned
expected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA
calls.

The underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs
of type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well
as sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'
expected_attach_type. Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME
should not be allowed doing a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind()
out of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.

In short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional
functionality or restrictions beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables.
The use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints. Fix it by enforcing
expected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().

Note that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or
cpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and
cpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment / context and therefore
these situations are not prone to this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40124 | sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40124</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III

Anthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios
enabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values
greater than the size to be copied. This lead to __copy_from_iter()
returning impossible values instead of the actual number of bytes it was
able to copy.

The BUG_ON has been reported in
https://lore.kernel.org/r/b14f55642207e63e907965e209f6323a0df6dcee.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de

The referenced commit introduced exception handlers on user-space memory
references in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These handlers return from
the respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy
using the current register contents. The exception handlers expect that
%o2 has already been masked during the bulk copy loop, but the masking was
performed after that loop. This will fix the return value of copy_from_user
and copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays
unchanged.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40125 | blk-mq: check kobject state_in_sysfs before deleting in blk_mq_unregister_hctx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40125</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Please note bs &gt; ps support is still under development and the
enablement patch is not even in btrfs development branch.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs reuses its data folio read path to handle symbolic links, as the
symbolic link target is stored as an inline data extent.

But for newly created inodes, btrfs only set the minimal order if the
target inode is a regular file.

Thus for above newly created symbolic link, it doesn't properly respect
the minimal folio order, and triggered the above crash.

[FIX]
Call btrfs_set_inode_mapping_order() unconditionally inside
btrfs_create_new_inode().

For symbolic links this will fix the crash as now the folio will meet
the minimal order.

For regular files this brings no change.

For directory/bdev/char and all the other types of inodes, they won't
go through the data read path, thus no effect either.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40129 | sunrpc: fix null pointer dereference on zero-length checksum</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40129</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix data race in CPU latency PM QoS request handling

The cpu_latency_qos_add/remove/update_request interfaces lack internal
synchronization by design, requiring the caller to ensure thread safety.
The current implementation relies on the 'pm_qos_enabled' flag, which is
insufficient to prevent concurrent access and cannot serve as a proper
synchronization mechanism. This has led to data races and list
corruption issues.

A typical race condition call trace is:

wifi: ath12k: Fix peer lookup in ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu()

In ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu(), peer lookup fails because
rxcb-&gt;peer_id is not updated with a valid value. This is expected
in monitor mode, where RX frames bypass the regular RX
descriptor path that typically sets rxcb-&gt;peer_id.
As a result, the peer is NULL, and link_id and link_valid fields
in the RX status are not populated. This leads to a WARN_ON in
mac80211 when it receives data frame from an associated station
with invalid link_id.

Fix this potential issue by using ppduinfo-&gt;peer_id, which holds
the correct peer id for the received frame. This ensures that the
peer is correctly found and the associated link metadata is updated
accordingly.

Fix this by checking if a valid table (map) exists before performing
request-based suspend and waiting for target I/O. When map is NULL,
skip these table-dependent suspend steps.

Even when map is NULL, no I/O can reach any target because there is
no table loaded; I/O submitted in this state will fail early in the
DM layer. Skipping the table-dependent suspend logic in this case
is safe and avoids NULL pointer dereferences.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40135 | ipv6: use RCU in ip6_xmit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40135</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Disable bottom softirqs as part of spin_lock_irq() on PREEMPT_RT

snd_pcm_group_lock_irq() acquires a spinlock_t and disables interrupts
via spin_lock_irq(). This also implicitly disables the handling of
softirqs such as TIMER_SOFTIRQ.
On PREEMPT_RT softirqs are preemptible and spin_lock_irq() does not
disable them. That means a timer can be invoked during spin_lock_irq()
on the same CPU. Due to synchronisations reasons local_bh_disable() has
a per-CPU lock named softirq_ctrl.lock which synchronizes individual
softirq against each other.
syz-bot managed to trigger a lockdep report where softirq_ctrl.lock is
acquired in hrtimer_cancel() in addition to hrtimer_run_softirq(). This
is a possible deadlock.

The softirq_ctrl.lock can not be made part of spin_lock_irq() as this
would lead to too much synchronisation against individual threads on the
system. To avoid the possible deadlock, softirqs must be manually
disabled before the lock is acquired.

Disable softirqs before the lock is acquired on PREEMPT_RT.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40143 | bpf: dont report verifier bug for missing bpf_scc_visit on speculative path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: dont report verifier bug for missing bpf_scc_visit on speculative path

Syzbot generated a program that triggers a verifier_bug() call in
maybe_exit_scc(). maybe_exit_scc() assumes that, when called for a
state with insn_idx in some SCC, there should be an instance of struct
bpf_scc_visit allocated for that SCC. Turns out the assumption does
not hold for speculative execution paths. See example in the next
patch.

maybe_scc_exit() is called from update_branch_counts() for states that
reach branch count of zero, meaning that path exploration for a
particular path is finished. Path exploration can finish in one of
three ways:
a. Verification error is found. In this case, update_branch_counts()
   is called only for non-speculative paths.
b. Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of
   an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return
   false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early.
c. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by
   is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates
   bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.

Hence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption
still holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC,
bpf_scc_visit instance must exist.

This patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40144 | nvdimm: ndtest: Return -ENOMEM if devm_kcalloc() fails in ndtest_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40144</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Tighten blk_throtl_activated() to also require that the throttle policy
bit is set on the queue:

  return q-&gt;td != NULL &amp;&amp;
         test_bit(blkcg_policy_throtl.plid, q-&gt;blkcg_pols);

This prevents blk_should_throtl() from accessing throttle group state
until policy data has been attached to blkgs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40148 | drm/amd/display: Add NULL pointer checks in dc_stream cursor attribute functions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add NULL pointer checks in dc_stream cursor attribute functions

The function dc_stream_set_cursor_attributes() currently dereferences
the `stream` pointer and nested members `stream-&gt;ctx-&gt;dc-&gt;current_state`
without checking for NULL.

All callers of these functions, such as in
`dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations()` and
`amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update()`, already perform NULL checks
before calling these functions.

Fixes below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_stream.c:336 dc_stream_program_cursor_attributes()
error: we previously assumed 'stream' could be null (see line 334)

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_stream.c
    327 bool dc_stream_program_cursor_attributes(
    328         struct dc_stream_state *stream,
    329         const struct dc_cursor_attributes *attributes)
    330 {
    331         struct dc  *dc;
    332         bool reset_idle_optimizations = false;

    334         dc = stream ? stream-&gt;ctx-&gt;dc : NULL;
                     ^^^^^^
The old code assumed stream could be NULL.

                                                    ^^^^^^
The refactor added an unchecked dereference.

This function used to check for if stream as NULL and return false at
the start. Probably we should add that back.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40149 | tls: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40149</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().

get_netdev_for_sock() is called during setsockopt(),
so not under RCU.

Using sk_dst_get(sk)-&gt;dev could trigger UAF.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().

Note that the only -&gt;ndo_sk_get_lower_dev() user is
bond_sk_get_lower_dev(), which uses RCU.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40150 | f2fs: fix to avoid migrating empty section</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid migrating empty section

It reports a bug from device w/ zufs:

F2FS-fs (dm-64): Inconsistent segment (173822) type [1, 0] in SSA and SIT
F2FS-fs (dm-64): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 4

Thread A				Thread B
- f2fs_expand_inode_data
 - f2fs_allocate_pinning_section
  - f2fs_gc_range
   - do_garbage_collect w/ segno #x
					- writepage
					 - f2fs_allocate_data_block
					  - new_curseg
					   - allocate segno #x

The root cause is: fallocate on pinning file may race w/ block allocation
as above, result in do_garbage_collect() from fallocate() may migrate
segment which is just allocated by a log, the log will update segment type
in its in-memory structure, however GC will get segment type from on-disk
SSA block, once segment type changes by log, we can detect such
inconsistency, then shutdown filesystem.

In this case, on-disk SSA shows type of segno #173822 is 1 (SUM_TYPE_NODE),
however segno #173822 was just allocated as data type segment, so in-memory
SIT shows type of segno #173822 is 0 (SUM_TYPE_DATA).

Change as below to fix this issue:
- check whether current section is empty before gc
- add sanity checks on do_garbage_collect() to avoid any race case, result
in migrating segment used by log.
- btw, it fixes misc issue in printed logs: "SSA and SIT" -&gt; "SIT and SSA".</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40151 | LoongArch: BPF: No support of struct argument in trampoline programs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40151</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Soft lockup is not triggered with THP or base page because there is
cond_resched() called for each PMD size.

Although the soft lockup was triggered by MTE, it should be not MTE
specific.  The other processing which takes long time in the loop may
trigger soft lockup too.

So add cond_resched() for hugetlb to avoid soft lockup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40154 | ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix invalid quirk input mapping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40154</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/i10nm: Skip DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory controller

When loading the i10nm_edac driver on some Intel Granite Rapids servers,
a call trace may appear as follows:

~0, resulting in the call trace above.

xsk: Harden userspace-supplied xdp_desc validation

Turned out certain clearly invalid values passed in xdp_desc from
userspace can pass xp_{,un}aligned_validate_desc() and then lead
to UBs or just invalid frames to be queued for xmit.

desc-&gt;len close to ``U32_MAX`` with a non-zero pool-&gt;tx_metadata_len
can cause positive integer overflow and wraparound, the same way low
enough desc-&gt;addr with a non-zero pool-&gt;tx_metadata_len can cause
negative integer overflow. Both scenarios can then pass the
validation successfully.
This doesn't happen with valid XSk applications, but can be used
to perform attacks.

Always promote desc-&gt;len to ``u64`` first to exclude positive
overflows of it. Use explicit check_{add,sub}_overflow() when
validating desc-&gt;addr (which is ``u64`` already).

xen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs

Change find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a
different CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON()
from bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate the error upwards.

Some VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must
be bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for
per-domain and global will probably fail when migrated off CPU 0,
especially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now returns -EEXIST
instead of BUG_ON().

A second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is not expected, but
make it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don't
know which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40161 | mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix SGI cleanup on unbind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40161</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Git bisects to: commit 4ae8d9aa9f9d ("sched/deadline: Fix dl_server getting stuck")

This happens since:
- dl_server hrtimer gets enqueued close to cpu offline, when
  kthread_park enqueues a fair task.
- CPU goes offline and drmgr removes it from cpu_present_mask.
- hrtimer fires and warning is hit.

Fix it by stopping the dl_server before CPU is marked dead.

A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links 
to be loaded without prompt. Such links could also be used to transmit system information, such as environment variables or configuration settings.

In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used a certain URI scheme linking to external files would 
load the contents of such files without prompting the user for 
permission to do so. Such URI scheme allows to include system configuration data, that is not supposed to be transmitted externally.

This issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper

Check that the resource which is converted to a surface exists before
trying to use the cursor snooper on it.

vmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers
because some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean "no surface",
unfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might
(and in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null
objects. Make sure that we validate not only the identifier (via the
vmw_cmd_res_check) but also check that the actual resource exists before
trying to do something with it.

Fixes unchecked null-ptr reference in the snooping code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 02:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40111 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix Use-after-free in validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40111</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
