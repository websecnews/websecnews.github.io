net/tcp: Disable TCP-AO static key after RCU grace period

The lifetime of TCP-AO static_key is the same as the last
tcp_ao_info. On the socket destruction tcp_ao_info ceases to be
with RCU grace period, while tcp-ao static branch is currently deferred
destructed. The static key definition is
: DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_DEFERRED_FALSE(tcp_ao_needed, HZ);

which means that if RCU grace period is delayed by more than a second
and tcp_ao_needed is in the process of disablement, other CPUs may
yet see tcp_ao_info which atent dead, but soon-to-be.
And that breaks the assumption of static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled().

See the comment near the definition:
&gt; * The caller must make sure that the static key can't get disabled while
&gt; * in this function. It doesn't patch jump labels, only adds a user to
&gt; * an already enabled static key.

Originally it was introduced in commit eb8c507296f6 ("jump_label:
Prevent key-&gt;enabled int overflow"), which is needed for the atomic
contexts, one of which would be the creation of a full socket from a
request socket. In that atomic context, it's known by the presence
of the key (md5/ao) that the static branch is already enabled.
So, the ref counter for that static branch is just incremented
instead of holding the proper mutex.
static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled() is just a helper for such usage
case. But it must not be used if the static branch could get disabled
in parallel as it's not protected by jump_label_mutex and as a result,
races with jump_label_update() implementation details.

Happened on netdev test-bot[1], so not a theoretical issue:

tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()

"tracing_map-&gt;next_elt" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.

Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map

Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the
tracing_map containing "tracing_map-&gt;max_size" elements, leaving no empty
entries.
If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using
`__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption
disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.

Fix this by preventing any further increments to "tracing_map-&gt;next_elt"

tracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED

When eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the
freeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user
space. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file
is created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that
opened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it
would set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,
and any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is
marked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was
set (under the event_mutex).

All the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a
pointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last
reference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it
is safe to free the file meta data.

A shortcut was made for the "format" file. It's i_private would point to
the "call" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is
because all format files are the same for the same "call", so it was
thought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files
maintain state (like the "enable", "trigger", etc). But this meant if the
file were to disappear, the "format" file would be unaware of it.

This caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that
would create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would
read the user_events format files:

In one console run:

 # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events
 # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done

And in another console run:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
 # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2&gt;/dev/null

With KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report
(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking
the file's meta data flag "EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED", so it would access the
event that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.

After inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check
the EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a
new helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the
event_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the
EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file
pointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use
the event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and
was not released since the event_file_file() call.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43892 | memcg: protect concurrent access to mem_cgroup_idr</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43892</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memcg: protect concurrent access to mem_cgroup_idr

Commit 73f576c04b94 ("mm: memcontrol: fix cgroup creation failure after
many small jobs") decoupled the memcg IDs from the CSS ID space to fix the
cgroup creation failures.  It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID
space.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for
modifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()
happen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex
from concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr
was not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for
different memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.

We have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in
our fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of
list_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting
code.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry
and inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the
memcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is
not allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow
memcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but
returned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.

Looking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id
is not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs
have same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most
reasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race
between multiple idr_remove() calls or race between
idr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing
multiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them
would cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from
other memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43893 | serial: core: check uartclk for zero to avoid divide by zero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43893</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[how]
dsc recompute should be skipped if no mode change detected on the new

net: drop bad gso csum_start and offset in virtio_net_hdr

Tighten csum_start and csum_offset checks in virtio_net_hdr_to_skb
for GSO packets.

The function already checks that a checksum requested with
VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM is in skb linear. But for GSO packets
this might not hold for segs after segmentation.

Syzkaller demonstrated to reach this warning in skb_checksum_help

	offset = skb_checksum_start_offset(skb);
	ret = -EINVAL;
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(offset &gt;= skb_headlen(skb)))

By injecting a TSO packet:

The geometry of the bad input packet at tcp_gso_segment:

[   52.003050][ T8403] csum(0x60000c7 start=199 offset=1536
ip_summed=3 complete_sw=0 valid=0 level=0)

Mitigate with stricter input validation.

csum_offset: for GSO packets, deduce the correct value from gso_type.
This is already done for USO. Extend it to TSO. Let UFO be:
udp[46]_ufo_fragment ignores these fields and always computes the
checksum in software.

csum_start: finding the real offset requires parsing to the transport
header. Do not add a parser, use existing segmentation parsing. Thanks
to SKB_GSO_DODGY, that also catches bad packets that are hw offloaded.
Again test both TSO and USO. Do not test UFO for the above reason, and
do not test UDP tunnel offload.

GSO packet are almost always CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. USO packets may be
CHECKSUM_NONE since commit 10154dbded6d6 ("udp: Allow GSO transmit
from devices with no checksum offload"), but then still these fields
are initialized correctly in udp4_hwcsum/udp6_hwcsum_outgoing. So no
need to test for ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL first.

This revises an existing fix mentioned in the Fixes tag, which broke
small packets with GSO offload, as detected by kselftests.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43898 | ext4: sanity check for NULL pointer after ext4_force_shutdown</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43898</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: sanity check for NULL pointer after ext4_force_shutdown

Test case: 2 threads write short inline data to a file.
In ext4_page_mkwrite the resulting inline data is converted.
Handling ext4_grp_locked_error with description "block bitmap
and bg descriptor inconsistent: X vs Y free clusters" calls
ext4_force_shutdown. The conversion clears
EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA but fails for
ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock and ext4_mark_iloc_dirty due
to ext4_forced_shutdown. The restoration of inline data fails
for the same reason not setting EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA.
Without the flag set a regular process path in ext4_da_write_end
follows trying to dereference page folio private pointer that has
not been set. The fix calls early return with -EIO error shall the
pointer to private be NULL.

media: xc2028: avoid use-after-free in load_firmware_cb()

syzkaller reported use-after-free in load_firmware_cb() [1].
The reason is because the module allocated a struct tuner in tuner_probe(),
and then the module initialization failed, the struct tuner was released.
A worker which created during module initialization accesses this struct
tuner later, it caused use-after-free.

The process is as follows:

task-6504           worker_thread
tuner_probe                             &lt;= alloc dvb_frontend [2]
...
request_firmware_nowait                 &lt;= create a worker
...
tuner_remove                            &lt;= free dvb_frontend
...
                    request_firmware_work_func  &lt;= the firmware is ready

This error happens when the color log tries to read the gamut remap
information from DCN401 which is not initialized in the dcn401_dpp_funcs
which leads to a null pointer dereference. This commit addresses this
issue by adding a proper guard to access the gamut_remap callback in
case the specific ASIC did not implement this function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43902 | drm/amd/display: Add null checker before passing variables</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43902</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing

This commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables in
the dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables were
previously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later in
the code without checking if they were null. This could potentially lead
to a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.

The null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null before
they are used, preventing potential crashes.

bpf: add missing check_func_arg_reg_off() to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, it's possible to pass in a modified CONST_PTR_TO_DYNPTR to
a global function as an argument. The adverse effects of this is that
BPF helpers can continue to make use of this modified
CONST_PTR_TO_DYNPTR from within the context of the global function,
which can unintentionally result in out-of-bounds memory accesses and
therefore compromise overall system stability i.e.

Add a check_func_arg_reg_off() to the path in which the BPF verifier
verifies the arguments of global function arguments, specifically
those which take an argument of type ARG_PTR_TO_DYNPTR |
MEM_RDONLY. Also, process_dynptr_func() doesn't appear to perform any
explicit and strict type matching on the supplied register type, so
let's also enforce that a register either type PTR_TO_STACK or
CONST_PTR_TO_DYNPTR is by the caller.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43911 | wifi: mac80211: fix NULL dereference at band check in starting tx ba session</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43911</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid5: avoid BUG_ON() while continue reshape after reassembling

Currently, mdadm support --revert-reshape to abort the reshape while

Root cause is that --revert-reshape update the raid_disks from 5 to 4,
while reshape position is still set, and after reassembling the array,
reshape position will be read from super block, then during reshape the
checking of 'writepos' that is caculated by old reshape position will
fail.

Fix this panic the easy way first, by converting the BUG_ON() to
WARN_ON(), and stop the reshape if checkings fail.

Noted that mdadm must fix --revert-shape as well, and probably md/raid
should enhance metadata validation as well, however this means
reassemble will fail and there must be user tools to fix the wrong
metadata.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44931 | gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44931</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.
Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
information leaks.

idpf: fix UAFs when destroying the queues

The second tagged commit started sometimes (very rarely, but possible)
throwing WARNs from
net/core/page_pool.c:page_pool_disable_direct_recycling().
Turned out idpf frees interrupt vectors with embedded NAPIs *before*
freeing the queues making page_pools' NAPI pointers lead to freed
memory before these pools are destroyed by libeth.
It's not clear whether there are other accesses to the freed vectors
when destroying the queues, but anyway, we usually free queue/interrupt
vectors only when the queues are destroyed and the NAPIs are guaranteed
to not be referenced anywhere.

Invert the allocation and freeing logic making queue/interrupt vectors
be allocated first and freed last. Vectors don't require queues to be
present, so this is safe. Additionally, this change allows to remove
that useless queue-&gt;q_vector pointer cleanup, as vectors are still
valid when freeing the queues (+ both are freed within one function,
so it's not clear why nullify the pointers at all).</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 10:22:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44933 | bnxt_en : Fix memory out-of-bounds in bnxt_fill_hw_rss_tbl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44933</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en : Fix memory out-of-bounds in bnxt_fill_hw_rss_tbl()

A recent commit has modified the code in __bnxt_reserve_rings() to
set the default RSS indirection table to default only when the number
of RX rings is changing.  While this works for newer firmware that
requires RX ring reservations, it causes the regression on older
firmware not requiring RX ring resrvations (BNXT_NEW_RM() returns
false).

With older firmware, RX ring reservations are not required and so
hw_resc-&gt;resv_rx_rings is not always set to the proper value.  The
comparison:

if (old_rx_rings != bp-&gt;hw_resc.resv_rx_rings)

in __bnxt_reserve_rings() may be false even when the RX rings are
changing.  This will cause __bnxt_reserve_rings() to skip setting
the default RSS indirection table to default to match the current
number of RX rings.  This may later cause bnxt_fill_hw_rss_tbl() to
use an out-of-range index.

We already have bnxt_check_rss_tbl_no_rmgr() to handle exactly this
scenario.  We just need to move it up in bnxt_need_reserve_rings()
to be called unconditionally when using older firmware.  Without the
fix, if the TX rings are changing, we'll skip the
bnxt_check_rss_tbl_no_rmgr() call and __bnxt_reserve_rings() may also
skip the bnxt_set_dflt_rss_indir_tbl() call for the reason explained
in the last paragraph.  Without setting the default RSS indirection
table to default, it causes the regression:

net: bridge: mcast: wait for previous gc cycles when removing port

syzbot hit a use-after-free[1] which is caused because the bridge doesn't
make sure that all previous garbage has been collected when removing a
port. What happens is:
      CPU 1                   CPU 2
 start gc cycle           remove port
                         acquire gc lock first
 wait for lock
                         call br_multicasg_gc() directly
 acquire lock now but    free port
 the port can be freed
 while grp timers still
 running

Make sure all previous gc cycles have finished by using flush_work before
freeing the port.

sctp: Fix null-ptr-deref in reuseport_add_sock().

syzbot reported a null-ptr-deref while accessing sk2-&gt;sk_reuseport_cb in
reuseport_add_sock(). [0]

The repro first creates a listener with SO_REUSEPORT.  Then, it creates
another listener on the same port and concurrently closes the first
listener.

The second listen() calls reuseport_add_sock() with the first listener as
sk2, where sk2-&gt;sk_reuseport_cb is not expected to be cleared concurrently,
but the close() does clear it by reuseport_detach_sock().

The problem is SCTP does not properly synchronise reuseport_alloc(),
reuseport_add_sock(), and reuseport_detach_sock().

The caller of reuseport_alloc() and reuseport_{add,detach}_sock() must
provide synchronisation for sockets that are classified into the same
reuseport group.

Otherwise, such sockets form multiple identical reuseport groups, and
all groups except one would be silently dead.

  1. Two sockets call listen() concurrently
  2. No socket in the same group found in sctp_ep_hashtable[]
  3. Two sockets call reuseport_alloc() and form two reuseport groups
  4. Only one group hit first in __sctp_rcv_lookup_endpoint() receives
      incoming packets

Also, the reported null-ptr-deref could occur.

TCP/UDP guarantees that would not happen by holding the hash bucket lock.

Let's apply the locking strategy to __sctp_hash_endpoint() and
__sctp_unhash_endpoint().

This is due to lib9p not properly verifying that the uname given in the Tauth and Tattach 9p messages matches the client UID returned from the factotum authentication handshake.


The only filesystem making use of these functions within the base 9front systems is the experimental hjfs disk filesystem, other disk filesystems (cwfs and gefs) are not affected by this bug.

This bug was inherited from Plan 9 and is present in all versions of 9front and is remedied fully in commit 9645ae07eb66a59015e3e118d0024790c37400da.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 21:38:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45258 | The req package before 3.43.4 for Go may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided, because cleanHost in http.go intention...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45258</link><description>The req package before 3.43.4 for Go may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided, because cleanHost in http.go intentionally uses a "garbage in, garbage out" design.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 21:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48957 | PureVPN Linux client 2.0.2-Productions fails to properly handle DNS queries, allowing them to bypass the VPN tunnel and be sent directly to ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48957</link><description>PureVPN Linux client 2.0.2-Productions fails to properly handle DNS queries, allowing them to bypass the VPN tunnel and be sent directly to the ISP or default DNS servers.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 16:39:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8011 | Logitech Options+ on MacOS prior 1.72 allows a local attacker to inject dynamic library within Options+ runtime and abuse permissions grante...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8011</link><description>Logitech Options+ on MacOS prior 1.72 allows a local attacker to inject dynamic library within Options+ runtime and abuse permissions granted by the user to Options+ such as Camera.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 11:54:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8147 | code-projects Pharmacy Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8147</link><description>A vulnerability was found in code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.
