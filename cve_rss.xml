This attack can be chained with CVE-2024-8503 to execute arbitrary shell commands starting from an unauthenticated perspective.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 19:36:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8503 | VICIdial Unauthenticated SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8503</link><description>An unauthenticated attacker can leverage a time-based SQL injection vulnerability in VICIdial to enumerate database records. By default, VICIdial stores plaintext credentials within the database.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 19:24:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45409 | The Ruby SAML library vulnerable to a SAML authentication bypass via Incorrect XPath selector</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45409</link><description>The Ruby SAML library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization. Ruby-SAML in &lt;= 12.2 and 1.13.0 &lt;= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 19:12:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45596 | Directus&amp;#x27;s session is cached for OpenID and OAuth2 if `redirect` is not used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45596</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 18:55:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34831 | cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in

The REST API exposes the history of any page in XWiki of which the attacker knows the name. The exposed information includes for each modification of the page the time of the modification, the version number, the author of the modification (both username and displayed name) and the version comment. This information is exposed regardless of the rights setup, and even when the wiki is configured to be fully private. On a private wiki, this can be tested by accessing /xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Main/pages/WebHome/history, if this shows the history of the main page then the installation is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 15.10.9 and XWiki 16.3.0RC1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 16:28:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45592 | auditor-bundle vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting because name of entity does not get escaped</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45592</link><description>auditor-bundle, formerly known as DoctrineAuditBundle, integrates auditor library into any Symfony 3.4+ application.

Remote user-controlled data tags can reach a Unicode normalization with a compatibility form NFKD. Under Windows, such normalization is costly in resources and may lead to denial of service with attacks such as One Million Unicode payload. This can get worse with the use of special Unicode characters like U+2100 (℀), or U+2105 (℅) which could lead the payload size to be tripled. Versions prior to 2.1.11 are affected by this vulnerability. The patch is included in 2.1.11.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31960 | An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor Exynos 1480, Exynos 2400.

When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. "w" for "whoami") the ACL check did not apply to the full form (i.e. "whoami") but to the abbreviated form (i.e. "w"). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that should forbid using the "whoami" command, you could still use "w" or "who" as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are used without any negation, the problem does not occur.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:08:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45393 | Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is missing authorization for endpoints related to webhook deliveries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45393</link><description>Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.

The message-parser normally reads reasonably sized chunks of the message. However, when it feeds them to message-header-parser, it starts building up "full_value" buffer out of the smaller chunks. The full_value buffer has no size limit, so large headers can cause large memory usage. It doesn't matter whether it's a single long header line, or a single header split into multiple lines. This bug exists in all Dovecot versions. Incoming mails typically have some size limits set by MTA, so even largest possible header size may still fit into Dovecot's vsz_limit. So attackers probably can't DoS a victim user this way. A user could APPEND larger mails though, allowing them to DoS themselves (although maybe cause some memory issues for the backend in general). One can implement restrictions on headers on MTA component preceding Dovecot.

In certain cases, path-to-regexp will output a regular expression that can be exploited to cause poor performance. Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and lead to a DoS. The bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (.). For users of 0.1, upgrade to 0.1.10. All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 19:12:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7260 | Keycloak-core: open redirect on account page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7260</link><description>An open redirect vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.

Once a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 18:55:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7318 | Keycloak-core: one time passcode (otp) is valid longer than expiration timeseverity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7318</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. Expired OTP codes are still usable when using FreeOTP when the OTP token period is set to 30 seconds (default). Instead of expiring and deemed unusable around 30 seconds in, the tokens are valid for an additional 30 seconds totaling 1 minute.
A one time passcode that is valid longer than its expiration time increases the attack window for malicious actors to abuse the system and compromise accounts. Additionally, it increases the attack surface because at any given time, two OTPs are valid.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 18:55:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7341 | Wildfly-elytron: org.keycloak/keycloak-services: session fixation in elytron saml adapters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7341</link><description>A session fixation issue was discovered in the SAML adapters provided by Keycloak.
