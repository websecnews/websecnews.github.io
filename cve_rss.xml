Prior to version 0.2.2, there are resource leaks when querying thread counts on Windows and Apple platforms. In Windows platforms, the thread_amount function calls CreateToolhelp32Snapshot but fails to close the returned HANDLE using CloseHandle. Repeated calls to this function will cause the handle count of the process to grow indefinitely, eventually leading to system instability or process termination when the handle limit is reached. In Apple platforms, the thread_amount function calls task_threads (via Mach kernel APIs) which allocates memory for the thread list. The function fails to deallocate this memory using vm_deallocate. Repeated calls will result in a steady memory leak, eventually causing the process to be killed by the OOM (Out of Memory) killer. This issue has been patched in version 0.2.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:23:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11935 | Forward Secrecy Violation in WolfSSL TLS 1.3</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11935</link><description>With TLS 1.3 pre-shared key (PSK) a malicious or faulty server could ignore the request for PFS (perfect forward secrecy) and the client would continue on with the connection using PSK without PFS. This happened when a server responded to a ClientHello containing psk_dhe_ke without a key_share extension. The re-use of an authenticated PSK connection that on the clients side unexpectedly did not have PFS, reduces the security of the connection.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:23:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65111 | SpiceDB&amp;#x27;s LookupResources with Multiple Entrypoints across Different Definitions Can Return Incomplete Results</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65111</link><description>SpiceDB is an open source database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions.

session key used for Public-Key Encrypted Session Key (PKESK) packets to
 be left uninitialized except for zeroing, resulting in it always being 
an all-zero byte array.

Any data encrypted using public-key encryption 
in this release can be decrypted trivially by supplying an all-zero 
session key, fully compromising confidentiality.

The vulnerability affects only public key encryption (PKESK packets).  Passphrase-based encryption (SKESK packets) is not affected.

Root cause: Vulnerable session key buffer used in PKESK packet generation.



The defect was introduced in commit `7bd9a8dc356aae756b40755be76d36205b6b161a` where initialization 
logic inside `encrypted_build_skesk()` only randomized the key for the 
SKESK path and omitted it for the PKESK path.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:16:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12747 | Tainacan &amp;lt;= 1.0.0 - Unauthenticated Information Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12747</link><description>The Tainacan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via uploaded files marked as private being exposed in wp-content without adequate protection.

In Grafana versions 12.x where SCIM provisioning is enabled and configured, a vulnerability in user identity handling allows a malicious or compromised SCIM client to provision a user with a numeric externalId, which in turn could allow to override internal user IDs and lead to impersonation or privilege escalation.

This vulnerability applies only if all of the following conditions are met:
- `enableSCIM` feature flag set to true
- `user_sync_enabled` config option in the `[auth.scim]` block set to true</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:33:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11127 | Mstoreapp Mobile (App &amp;lt;= 2.08, Multivendor &amp;lt;= 9.0.1) - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11127</link><description>The Mstoreapp Mobile App WordPress plugin through 2.08 and Mstoreapp Mobile Multivendor through 9.0.1 do not properly verify users identify when using an AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to retrieve a valid session for arbitrary users by knowing their email address.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10039 | ELEX WordPress HelpDesk &amp;amp; Customer Ticketing System &amp;lt;= 3.2.9 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Insecure Direct Object Reference via &amp;#x27;eh_crm_ticket_single_view_client&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10039</link><description>The ELEX WordPress HelpDesk &amp; Customer Ticketing System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.9 via the 'eh_crm_ticket_single_view_client' due to missing validation on a user controlled key.

btrfs: fix memory leak of qgroup_list in btrfs_add_qgroup_relation

When btrfs_add_qgroup_relation() is called with invalid qgroup levels
(src &gt;= dst), the function returns -EINVAL directly without freeing the
preallocated qgroup_list structure passed by the caller. This causes a
memory leak because the caller unconditionally sets the pointer to NULL
after the call, preventing any cleanup.

The issue occurs because the level validation check happens before the
mutex is acquired and before any error handling path that would free
the prealloc pointer. On this early return, the cleanup code at the
'out' label (which includes kfree(prealloc)) is never reached.

In btrfs_ioctl_qgroup_assign(), the code pattern is:

    prealloc = kzalloc(sizeof(*prealloc), GFP_KERNEL);
    ret = btrfs_add_qgroup_relation(trans, sa-&gt;src, sa-&gt;dst, prealloc);
    prealloc = NULL;  // Always set to NULL regardless of return value
    ...
    kfree(prealloc);  // This becomes kfree(NULL), does nothing

When the level check fails, 'prealloc' is never freed by either the
callee or the caller, resulting in a 64-byte memory leak per failed
operation. This can be triggered repeatedly by an unprivileged user
with access to a writable btrfs mount, potentially exhausting kernel
memory.

Fix this by freeing prealloc before the early return, ensuring prealloc
is always freed on all error paths.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 10:40:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40210 | Revert &amp;quot;NFSD: Remove the cap on number of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40210</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "NFSD: Remove the cap on number of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND"

I've found that pynfs COMP6 now leaves the connection or lease in a
strange state, which causes CLOSE9 to hang indefinitely. I've dug
into it a little, but I haven't been able to root-cause it yet.
However, I bisected to commit 48aab1606fa8 ("NFSD: Remove the cap on
number of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND").

Tianshuo Han also reports a potential vulnerability when decoding
an NFSv4 COMPOUND. An attacker can place an arbitrarily large op
count in the COMPOUND header, which results in:

[   51.410584] nfsd: vmalloc error: size 1209533382144, exceeds total
pages, mode:0xdc0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO),
nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0

when NFSD attempts to allocate the COMPOUND op array.

Let's restore the operation-per-COMPOUND limit, but increased to 200
for now.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 10:40:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40211 | ACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40211</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()

The switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device-&gt;brightness
and device-&gt;backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()
during device removal.

If the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()
frees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when
acpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device-&gt;brightness or
device-&gt;backlight.

Fix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's
switch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()
after removing the notify handler that queues the work. This ensures
the work completes before the memory is freed.

From versions 0.10.2 to before 0.11.1, a memory corruption vulnerability could lead to a crash (denial-of-service) and potentially remote code execution (RCE), exists in the Completions API endpoint. When processing user-supplied prompt embeddings, the endpoint loads serialized tensors using torch.load() without sufficient validation. Due to a change introduced in PyTorch 2.8.0, sparse tensor integrity checks are disabled by default. As a result, maliciously crafted tensors can bypass internal bounds checks and trigger an out-of-bounds memory write during the call to to_dense(). This memory corruption can crash vLLM and potentially lead to code execution on the server hosting vLLM. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:44:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62372 | vLLM vulnerable to DoS with incorrect shape of multimodal embedding inputs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62372</link><description>vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs).

In ClipBucket version 5.5.2, a change to network.class.php causes the application to dynamically build the server URL from the incoming HTTP Host header when the configuration base_url is not set. Because Host is a client-controlled header, an attacker can supply an arbitrary Host value. This allows an attacker to cause password-reset links (sent by forget.php) to be generated with the attacker’s domain. If a victim follows that link and enters their activation code on the attacker-controlled domain, the attacker can capture the code and use it to reset the victim’s password and take over the account. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.2#162.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:55:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62724 | Open OnDemand allowlist bypass using symlinks in directory downloads (TOCTOU)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62724</link><description>Open OnDemand is an open-source HPC portal.

When an invalid CSV file is uploaded, the application returns a progress_message value that is rendered as raw HTML in the admin interface. An attacker can intercept and modify the POST /livewire/update request to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the progress_message. Because the server accepts the modified input without sanitization and reflects it back to the user, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the browser of any authenticated admin who views the import page.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:55:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13437 | Arbitrary node_modules Directory Deletion in Google zx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13437</link><description>When zx is invoked with --prefer-local=, the CLI creates a symlink named ./node_modules pointing to /node_modules.
