We can see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment` is defined with an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`.  The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000 bytes it will overflow the `header` buffer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 14:10:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24685 | Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the readOFF functionality of libigl v2.5.0.

Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `"0.0.0.0"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `"::"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:29:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35238 | Denial of service of Minder Server from maliciously crafted GitHub attestations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35238</link><description>Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.

The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:

1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.
2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.
3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35236 | Audiobookshelf Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability via crafted ebooks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35236</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35237 | MIT IdentiBot User-Kerberos Mapping Publicly Available</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35237</link><description>MIT IdentiBot is an open-source Discord bot written in Node.js that verifies individuals' affiliations with MIT, grants them roles in a Discord server, and stores information about them in a database backend. A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a "public" Discord application—i.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e). There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch. To prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, all vulnerable instances of IdentiBot should be taken offline until they have been updated.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35231 | rack-contrib vulnerable to Denial of Service due to the unconstrained value of the incoming &amp;quot;profiler_runs&amp;quot; parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35231</link><description>rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web server interface. Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 16:49:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-4969 | bwoodsend rockhopper Binary Parser ragged_array.c count_rows buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4969</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in bwoodsend rockhopper up to 0.1.2. Affected by this issue is the function count_rows of the file rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c of the component Binary Parser. The manipulation of the argument raw leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. Upgrading to version 0.2.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 1a15fad5e06ae693eb9b8908363d2c8ef455104e. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

A security vulnerability involving insecure file permissions has been identified in the Kaminari pagination library for Ruby on Rails, concerning insecure file permissions. This vulnerability is of moderate severity due to the potential for unauthorized write access to particular Ruby files managed by the library. Such access could lead to the alteration of application behavior or data integrity issues. Users of affected versions are advised to update to Kaminari version 1.2.2 or later, where file permissions have been adjusted to enhance security. If upgrading is not feasible immediately, review and adjust the file permissions for particular Ruby files in Kaminari to ensure they are only accessible by authorized user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 16:24:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35219 | OpenAPI Generator Online - Arbitrary File Read/Delete</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35219</link><description>OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec.
