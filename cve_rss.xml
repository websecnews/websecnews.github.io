This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 22:13:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47518 | Specially constructed queries targeting ETM could discover active remote access sessions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47518</link><description>Specially constructed queries targeting ETM could discover active remote access sessions</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:57:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47517 | Expired and unusable administrator authentication tokens can be revealed by units that have timed out from ETM access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47517</link><description>Expired and unusable administrator authentication tokens can be revealed by units that have timed out from ETM access</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:50:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9134 | Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in the reporting application.

Prior to 2.10.4, there is a flaw in the authentication in the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter class, which can be bypassed and cause the risk of unauthorized access. In the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter class, ”request.getRequestURI“ is used to obtain the request URL, and it is passed to the "WhitelistUtils.match" method to determine whether the URL request is an interface that does not require authentication. The "match" method filters semicolons, but this is not enough. When users set "server.servlet.context-path" when deploying products, there is still a risk of being bypassed, which can be bypassed by any whitelist prefix /geo/../context-path/. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.4.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 15:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22949 | Tenda ac9 v1.0 firmware v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to command injection in /goform/SetSambaCfg, which may lead to remote arbitrary code exec...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22949</link><description>Tenda ac9 v1.0 firmware v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to command injection in /goform/SetSambaCfg, which may lead to remote arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 15:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22946 | Tenda ac9 v1.0 firmware v15.03.05.19 contains a stack overflow vulnerability in /goform/SetOnlineDevName, which may lead to remote arbitrary...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22946</link><description>Tenda ac9 v1.0 firmware v15.03.05.19 contains a stack overflow vulnerability in /goform/SetOnlineDevName, which may lead to remote arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 15:12:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23022 | FreeType 2.8.1 has a signed integer overflow in cf2_doFlex in cff/cf2intrp.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23022</link><description>FreeType 2.8.1 has a signed integer overflow in cf2_doFlex in cff/cf2intrp.c.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 15:12:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57686 | A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in /landrecordsys/admin/contactus.php in PHPGurukul Land Record System v1.0, which allo...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57686</link><description>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in /landrecordsys/admin/contactus.php in PHPGurukul Land Record System v1.0, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "pagetitle" parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 13:53:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57687 | An OS Command Injection vulnerability was found in /landrecordsys/admin/dashboard.php in PHPGurukul Land Record System v1.0, which allows re...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57687</link><description>An OS Command Injection vulnerability was found in /landrecordsys/admin/dashboard.php in PHPGurukul Land Record System v1.0, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "Cookie" GET request parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 13:46:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41787 | IBM Engineering Requirements Management DOORS Next code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41787</link><description>IBM Engineering Requirements Management DOORS Next 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a race condition.

Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:55:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13239 | Two-factor Authentication (TFA) - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-003</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13239</link><description>Weak Authentication vulnerability in Drupal Two-factor Authentication (TFA) allows Authentication Abuse.This issue affects Two-factor Authentication (TFA): from 0.0.0 before 1.5.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:48:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13238 | Typogrify - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2024-002</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13238</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal Typogrify allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Typogrify: from 0.0.0 before 1.3.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13237 | File Entity (fieldable files) - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-001</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13237</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal File Entity (fieldable files) allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects File Entity (fieldable files): from 7.X-* before 7.X-2.38.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21598 | Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: When BGP traceoptions are configured, receipt of malformed BGP packets causes RPD to crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21598</link><description>An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved's routing protocol daemon (rpd) allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to send malformed BGP packets to a device configured with packet receive trace options enabled to crash rpd.

This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[]: Received malformed update from  (External AS )
and
  rpd[]: Malformed Attribute</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22149 | JWK Set&amp;#x27;s HTTP client only overwrites and appends JWK to local cache during refresh</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22149</link><description>JWK Set (JSON Web Key Set) is a JWK and JWK Set Go implementation.

This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 17:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21628 | Chatwoot has a Blind SQL-injection in Conversation and Contacts filters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21628</link><description>Chatwoot is a customer engagement suite.

Through the execution of either 'show services advanced-anti-malware' or 'show services security-intelligence' command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. 

The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models.

Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.

Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit by
either obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trial
and error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)
account to gain access to the .exe CGI binary or .sh
script to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such access
send an HTTP request that triggers it.


Impact: High – The  process, which we assume is
responsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing after
performing the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflow
causes the process to segfault before

Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.

Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station.

temporary file.  The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user's
current `umask` settings, meaning that it's possible for other users on the
same system to read the contents of the temporary file.

Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contents
of this temporary file while a user is editing it.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27980 | Due to the improper handling of batch files in child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync, a malicious command line argument can inject a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27980</link><description>Due to the improper handling of batch files in child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync, a malicious command line argument can inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37372 | The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix that can be ignored, which is not alw...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37372</link><description>The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix that can be ignored, which is not always true.
