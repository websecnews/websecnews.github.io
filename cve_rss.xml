Change request allows to edit any page by default, and the changes are then exported in an XML file that anyone can download. So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing an edit on the user profiles and then downloading the XML file that has been created. This is also true for any document that might contain password field and that a user can view.
This vulnerability impacts all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have the Change request right (allowed by default) and view rights on the page to target. This issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated way. The patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages that contains a password field with change request. It means that already existing change request for those pages won't be removed by the patch, administrators needs to take care of it. The patch is provided in Change Request 1.10, administrators should upgrade immediately. It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by denying manually the Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki space which will include any user profile by default.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 22:41:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-24046 | An issue was discovered on Connectize AC21000 G6 641.139.1.1256 allows attackers to run arbitrary commands via use of a crafted string in th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-24046</link><description>An issue was discovered on Connectize AC21000 G6 641.139.1.1256 allows attackers to run arbitrary commands via use of a crafted string in the ping utility.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 22:41:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4460 | Uploading SVG, WEBP and ICO files &amp;lt;= 1.2.1 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4460</link><description>The Uploading SVG, WEBP and ICO files WordPress plugin through 1.2.1 does not sanitise uploaded SVG files, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:39:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5105 | Frontend File Manager &amp;lt;

Unhandled errors in API requests coming from an authenticated user include traceback information, which can include path information. There is no known mechanism by which to trigger these errors without authentication, so the paths revealed are not considered particularly sensitive, given that the requesting user has arbitrary execution permissions already in the same environment. A fix has been introduced in commit `0056c3aa52` which no longer includes traceback information in JSON error responses. For compatibility, the traceback field is present, but always empty. This commit has been included in version 2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47633 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Traefik</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47633</link><description>Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. The traefik docker container uses 100% CPU when it serves as its own backend, which is an automatically generated route resulting from the Docker integration in the default configuration. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 20:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47106 | Incorrect processing of fragment in the URL leads to Authorization Bypass in Traefik</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47106</link><description>Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When a request is sent to Traefik with a URL fragment, Traefik automatically URL encodes and forwards the fragment to the backend server. This violates RFC 7230 because in the origin-form the URL should only contain the absolute path and the query. When this is combined with another frontend proxy like Nginx, it can be used to bypass frontend proxy URI-based access control restrictions. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 20:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47124 | Denial of service whith ACME HTTPChallenge in Traefik</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47124</link><description>Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When Traefik is configured to use the `HTTPChallenge` to generate and renew the Let's Encrypt TLS certificates, the delay authorized to solve the challenge (50 seconds) can be exploited by attackers to achieve a `slowloris attack`. This vulnerability has been patch in version 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should replace the `HTTPChallenge` with the `TLSChallenge` or the `DNSChallenge`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 20:30:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48910 | Microcks up to 1.17.1 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the component /jobs and /artifact/download.
