Prior to 1.5.3 and 1.6.1, a vulnerability was discovered that allows a VM to read arbitrary files from the virt-launcher pod's file system. This issue stems from improper symlink handling when mounting PVC disks into a VM. Specifically, if a malicious user has full or partial control over the contents of a PVC, they can create a symbolic link that points to a file within the virt-launcher pod's file system. Since libvirt can treat regular files as block devices, any file on the pod's file system that is symlinked in this way can be mounted into the VM and subsequently read. Although a security mechanism exists where VMs are executed as an unprivileged user with UID 107 inside the virt-launcher container, limiting the scope of accessible resources, this restriction is bypassed due to a second vulnerability. The latter causes the ownership of any file intended for mounting to be changed to the unprivileged user with UID 107 prior to mounting. As a result, an attacker can gain access to and read arbitrary files located within the virt-launcher pod's file system or on a mounted PVC from within the guest VM. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.3 and 1.6.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:27:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64437 | KubeVirt Isolation Detection Flaw Allows Arbitrary File Permission Changes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64437</link><description>KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions before 1.5.3 and 1.6.1, the virt-handler does not verify whether the launcher-sock is a symlink or a regular file. This oversight can be exploited, for example, to change the ownership of arbitrary files on the host node to the unprivileged user with UID 107 (the same user used by virt-launcher) thus, compromising the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) of data on the host. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker should be in control of the file system of the virt-launcher pod. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.3 and 1.6.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:27:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64435 | KubeVirt VMI Denial-of-Service (DoS) Using Pod Impersonation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64435</link><description>KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. Prior to 1.7.0-beta.0, a logic flaw in the virt-controller allows an attacker to disrupt the control over a running VMI by creating a pod with the same labels as the legitimate virt-launcher pod associated with the VMI. This can mislead the virt-controller into associating the fake pod with the VMI, resulting in incorrect status updates and potentially causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.0-beta.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:09:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64436 | KubeVirt Excessive Role Permissions Could Enable Unauthorized VMI Migrations Between Nodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64436</link><description>KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In 1.5.0 and earlier, the permissions granted to the virt-handler service account, such as the ability to update VMI and patch nodes, could be abused to force a VMI migration to an attacker-controlled node. This vulnerability could otherwise allow an attacker to mark all nodes as unschedulable, potentially forcing the migration or creation of privileged pods onto a compromised node.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:09:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64434 | KubeVirt Improper TLS Certificate Management Handling Allows API Identity Spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64434</link><description>KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes.

In versions 4.2.0 through 7.5.3, and 8.0.0 through 8.3.1-alpha.1, there is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying to upload a Parse.File with uri parameter, allowing execution of an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response. This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.4 and 8.4.0-alpha.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57697 | AstrBot Project v3.5.22 has an arbitrary file read vulnerability in function _encode_image_bs64.

In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files.

Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively).

In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1, 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container's /dev/null to mask. This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount gadget, leading to host information disclosure, host denial of service, container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25621 | containerd affected by a local privilege escalation via wide permissions on CRI directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25621</link><description>containerd is an open-source container runtime.

This flaw stems from a defect in the XML parsing logic, which allows an attacker to construct a malicious XML entity that forces the server to initiate an HTTP request to an arbitrary internal or external network address. Successful exploitation could lead to internal network reconnaissance, port scanning, or the retrieval of sensitive information. The vulnerability may be present in the backend API called by or associated with the path `/admin/#/webset/?head_tab_active=0`, where user-provided XML data is processed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:40:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12815 | An ownership verification issue in the Virtual Desktop preview page in the Research and Engineering Studio (RES) on AWS before version 2025....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12815</link><description>An ownership verification issue in the Virtual Desktop preview page in the Research and Engineering Studio (RES) on AWS before version 2025.09 may allow an authenticated remote user to view another user's active desktop session metadata, including periodical desktop preview screenshots.
