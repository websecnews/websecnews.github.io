Handling 'unknown'-type values from string literals without type designation can disclose bytes, potentially revealing notable and confidential information. This issue exists due to excessive data output in aggregate function calls, enabling remote users to read some portion of system memory.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 18:13:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5869 | Postgresql: buffer overrun from integer overflow in array modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5869</link><description>A flaw was found in PostgreSQL that allows authenticated database users to execute arbitrary code through missing overflow checks during SQL array value modification. This issue exists due to an integer overflow during array modification where a remote user can trigger the overflow by providing specially crafted data. This enables the execution of arbitrary code on the target system, allowing users to write arbitrary bytes to memory and extensively read the server's memory.</description><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 18:13:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5870 | Postgresql: role pg_signal_backend can signal certain superuser processes.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5870</link><description>A flaw was found in PostgreSQL involving the pg_cancel_backend role that signals background workers, including the logical replication launcher, autovacuum workers, and the autovacuum launcher. Successful exploitation requires a non-core extension with a less-resilient background worker and would affect that specific background worker only.

A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller &gt;= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 01:22:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6560 | Kernel: io_uring out of boundary memory access in __io_uaddr_map()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6560</link><description>An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the io_uring SQ/CQ rings functionality in the Linux kernel.

This has been recently changed to use the regular expression `^https?://`, however this regular expression can be bypassed by an absolute URL with leading whitespace. For example `\nhttps://whatever.com` which has a leading newline. According to the fetch specification, before a fetch is made the URL is normalized. "To normalize a byte sequence potentialValue, remove any leading and trailing HTTP whitespace bytes from potentialValue.". This means the final request will be normalized to `https://whatever.com` bypassing the check and nuxt-api-party will send a request outside of the whitelist. This could allow us to leak credentials or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should revert to the previous method of detecting absolute URLs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 23:50:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49800 | Denial of service by abusing `fetchOptions.retry` in nuxt-api-party</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49800</link><description>`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 23:50:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49798 | Duplicated execution of subcalls in OpenZeppelin Contracts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49798</link><description>OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. A merge issue when porting the 5.0.1 patch to the 4.9 branch caused a line duplication. In the version of `Multicall.sol` released in `@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.4` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@4.9.4`, all subcalls are executed twice. Concretely, this exposes a user to unintentionally duplicate operations like asset transfers. The duplicated delegatecall was removed in version 4.9.5. The 4.9.4 version is marked as deprecated. Users are advised to upgrade.

Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 20:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49782 | Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in error message passing in richdocumentscode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49782</link><description>Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology.

The issue was fixed in CPython 3.12.1 and does not affect other stable releases.

When using the `extra_groups=` parameter with an empty list as a value (ie `extra_groups=[]`) the logic regressed to not call `setgroups(0, NULL)` before calling `exec()`, thus not dropping the original processes' groups before starting the new process. There is no issue when the parameter isn't used or when any value is used besides an empty list.

This issue only impacts CPython processes run with sufficient privilege to make the `setgroups` system call (typically `root`).</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 18:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6622 | Kernel: null pointer dereference vulnerability in nft_dynset_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6622</link><description>A null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in nft_dynset_init() in net/netfilter/nft_dynset.c in nf_tables in the Linux kernel.

parsing a specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example,
 if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop.


Canisters using affected versions of candid
 are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run 
indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum 
instruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload 
will result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters written in Motoko are unaffected.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:37:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49443 | DoraCMS v2.1.8 was discovered to re-use the same code for verification of valid usernames and passwords.
