To execute code as the root user, the attacker must have the SNMPv1 or v2c read-only community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials and administrative or privilege 15 credentials on the affected device. &#13; &#13; An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device over IPv4 or IPv6 networks. 
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a stack overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or allow a high-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and obtain full control of the affected system.
&#13; Note: This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 17:32:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48869 | Horilla Unauthorized Access to Candidate Resume Files Due to Broken Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48869</link><description>Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS).

&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system and performing an API call with crafted input. Alternatively, an unauthenticated attacker could persuade a legitimate user with administrative privileges who is currently logged in to the system to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 17:13:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20339 | Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20339</link><description>A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing of IPv4 packets of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.

directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8869</link><description>When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706.
Note that upgrading pip to a "fixed" version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by using a Python version that implements PEP 706.

Note that this is a vulnerability in pip's fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706
and therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're using a Python version that implements PEP 706
then pip doesn't use the "vulnerable" fallback code.

Mitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python &gt;=3.9.17, &gt;=3.10.12, &gt;=3.11.4, or &gt;=3.12),
applying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:20:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48868 | Horilla vulnerable to authenticated RCE via eval() in project_bulk_archive</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48868</link><description>Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:52:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23248 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the nvdisasm binary where a user may cause an out-of-bounds read by passin...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23248</link><description>NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for all platforms contains a vulnerability in the nvdisasm binary where a user may cause an out-of-bounds read by passing a malformed ELF file to nvdisasm.

This issue affects Apache ZooKeeper: from 3.9.0 before 3.9.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.4, which fixes the issue.

The issue can be mitigated by disabling both commands (via admin.snapshot.enabled and admin.restore.enabled), disabling the whole AdminServer interface (via admin.enableServer), or ensuring that the root ACL does not provide open permissions. (Note that ZooKeeper ACLs are not recursive, so this does not impact operations on child nodes besides notifications from recursive watches.)</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:42:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41715 | Missing Authentication for Database Access in Web Application</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41715</link><description>The database for the web application is exposed without authentication, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:28:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41716 | Unauthenticated User Enumeration via Missing Authentication</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41716</link><description>The web application allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to learn information about existing user accounts with their corresponding role due to missing authentication for critical function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:28:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9031 | Timing-Based Username Enumeration in DivvyDrive Information Technologies&amp;#x27; DivvyDrive Web</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9031</link><description>Observable Timing Discrepancy vulnerability in DivvyDrive Information Technologies Inc.

In versions 0.5.3 and earlier of astral-tokio-tar, tar archives may extract outside of their intended destination directory when using the Entry::unpack_in_raw API. Additionally, the Entry::allow_external_symlinks control (which defaults to true) could be bypassed via a pair of symlinks that individually point within the destination but combine to point outside of it. These behaviors could be used individually or combined to bypass the intended security control of limiting extraction to the given directory. This in turn would allow an attacker with a malicious tar archive to perform an arbitrary file write and potentially pivot into code execution. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.4. There is no workaround other than upgrading.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 20:14:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57636 | OS Command injection vulnerability in D-Link C1 2020-02-21.

The vulnerability arises from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled regular expressions in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists. Malicious regular expressions can cause catastrophic backtracking during the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization and a denial of service. This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:59:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8354 | RFA File Parsing Type Confusion Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8354</link><description>A maliciously crafted RFA file, when parsed through Autodesk Revit, can force a Type Confusion vulnerability.

The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js` uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the 'USER' role to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `['USE', 'CREATE']` passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well, such as `PROMPTS`.

dmaengine: ti: edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_map

Fix a critical memory allocation bug in edma_setup_from_hw() where
queue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory. The code
declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8),
but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.

This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing:
  queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;
  queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;

The bug manifested as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction"
on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the
memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.

Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which
automatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39870 | dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39870</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()

The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error
handling is a bit subtle.  It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner
way.  The issues here are:

1) If "idxd-&gt;max_wqs" is &lt;= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when
   "conf_dev" hasn't been initialized.
2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again "conf_dev" is invalid.  It's
   either uninitialized or it points to the "conf_dev" from the
   previous iteration so it leads to a double free.

It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then
the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations.  I also
renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto
was located.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39871 | dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB

can_put_echo_skb() takes ownership of the SKB and it may be freed

However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call.

Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done
touching the SKB.

The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and
also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not
matter.

An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb
memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.

macsec: sync features on RTM_NEWLINK

Syzkaller managed to lock the lower device via ETHTOOL_SFEATURES:

It happens because lower features are out of sync with the upper:

  __dev_ethtool (real_dev)
    netdev_lock_ops(real_dev)
    ETHTOOL_SFEATURES
      __netdev_features_change

		  ...

    netdev_unlock_ops(real_dev)

Per commit af5f54b0ef9e ("net: Lock lower level devices when updating
features"), we elide the lock/unlock when the upper and lower features
are synced. Makes sure the lower (real_dev) has proper features after
the macsec link has been created. This makes sure we never hit the
situation where we need to sync upper flags to the lower.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:15:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39875 | igb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39875</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

not added to the test rings.

mm/damon/sysfs: fix use-after-free in state_show()

state_show() reads kdamond-&gt;damon_ctx without holding damon_sysfs_lock.

mutex_lock(&amp;amp;ctx-&gt;kdamond_lock); /* UAF */

(The race can also occur with damon_sysfs_kdamonds_rm_dirs() and
damon_sysfs_kdamond_release(), which free or replace the context under
damon_sysfs_lock.)

Fix by taking damon_sysfs_lock before dereferencing the context, mirroring
the locking used in pid_show().

The bug has existed since state_show() first accessed kdamond-&gt;damon_ctx.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39878 | ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39878</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error

The function move_dirty_folio_in_page_array() was created by commit
ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method") by
moving code from ceph_writepages_start() to this function.

This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked
by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the
caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the
loop.

However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it
always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and
then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are
silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may
later crash the kernel.

The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39879 | ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39879</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()

The function ceph_process_folio_batch() sets folio_batch entries to
NULL, which is an illegal state.  Before folio_batch_release() crashes
due to this API violation, the function ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()
is supposed to remove those NULLs from the array.

However, since commit ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce
ceph_process_folio_batch() method"), this shifting doesn't happen
anymore because the "for" loop got moved to ceph_process_folio_batch(),
and now the `i` variable that remains in ceph_writepages_start()
doesn't get incremented anymore, making the shifting effectively
unreachable much of the time.

Later, commit 1551ec61dc55 ("ceph: introduce ceph_submit_write()
method") added more preconditions for doing the shift, replacing the
`i` check (with something that is still just as broken):

- if ceph_process_folio_batch() fails, shifting never happens

- if ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() was never called (because
  ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of various
  reasons), shifting never happens

- if `processed_in_fbatch` is zero (because ceph_process_folio_batch()
  has returned early for some of the reasons mentioned above or
  because ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() has failed), shifting
  never happens

Since those two commits, any problem in ceph_process_folio_batch()
could crash the kernel, e.g. this way:

The crash can be reproduced easily by changing the
ceph_check_page_before_write() return value to `-E2BIG`.

(Interestingly, the crash happens only if `huge_zero_folio` has
already been allocated; without `huge_zero_folio`,
is_huge_zero_folio(NULL) returns true and folios_put_refs() skips NULL
entries instead of dereferencing them.  That makes reproducing the bug
somewhat unreliable.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/20250826231626.218675-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com
for a discussion of this detail.)

My suggestion is to move the ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() to right
after ceph_process_folio_batch() to ensure it always gets called to
fix up the illegal folio_batch state.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39880 | libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39880</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and

checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).

On 64-bit systems, con-&gt;v1.auth_retry overlaps with con-&gt;v2.out_iter,
so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of
0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the
side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive
fetching of new tickets.

con-&gt;v1.connect_seq overlaps with con-&gt;v2.conn_bufs and the fact that

it's not something that happens often.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39881 | kernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39881</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The race condition occurs because:
1. When cgroup.pressure is disabled (echo 0 &gt; cgroup.pressure), it:
   - Releases PSI triggers via cgroup_file_release()
   - Frees of-&gt;priv through kernfs_drain_open_files()
2. While epoll still holds reference to the file and continues polling
3. Re-enabling (echo 1 &gt; cgroup.pressure) accesses freed of-&gt;priv

To address this issue, introduce kernfs_get_active_of() for kernfs open

to prevent further operations on released file descriptors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39882 | drm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39882</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception ]---

The root cause is that unpoison_memory() tries to check the PG_HWPoison
flags of an uninitialized page.  So VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(page)) is
triggered.  This can be reproduced by below steps:

1.Offline memory block:

 echo offline &gt; /sys/devices/system/memory/memory12/state

2.Get offlined memory pfn:

 page-types -b n -rlN

3.Write pfn to unpoison-pfn

 echo  &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/hwpoison/unpoison-pfn

This scenario can be identified by pfn_to_online_page() returning NULL. 
And ZONE_DEVICE pages are never expected, so we can simply fail if
pfn_to_online_page() == NULL to fix the bug.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39884 | btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39884</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race

There is a race condition between inode eviction and inode caching that
can cause a live struct btrfs_inode to be missing from the root-&gt;inodes
xarray. Specifically, there is a window during evict() between the inode
being unhashed and deleted from the xarray. If btrfs_iget() is called
for the same inode in that window, it will be recreated and inserted
into the xarray, but then eviction will delete the new entry, leaving
nothing in the xarray:

Thread 1                          Thread 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
evict()
  remove_inode_hash()
                                  btrfs_iget_path()
                                    btrfs_iget_locked()
                                    btrfs_read_locked_inode()
                                      btrfs_add_inode_to_root()
  destroy_inode()
    btrfs_destroy_inode()
      btrfs_del_inode_from_root()
        __xa_erase

In turn, this can cause issues for subvolume deletion. Specifically, if
an inode is in this lost state, and all other inodes are evicted, then
btrfs_del_inode_from_root() will call btrfs_add_dead_root() prematurely.
If the lost inode has a delayed_node attached to it, then when
btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot() calls btrfs_kill_all_delayed_nodes(),
it will loop forever because the delayed_nodes xarray will never become
empty (unless memory pressure forces the inode out). We saw this
manifest as soft lockups in production.

Fix it by only deleting the xarray entry if it matches the given inode
(using __xa_cmpxchg()).</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39885 | ocfs2: fix recursive semaphore deadlock in fiemap call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39885</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2_fiemap() takes a read lock of the ip_alloc_sem semaphore (since
v2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the
extent list of this running mmap executable.  The user supplied buffer to
hold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which
will take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same
semaphore.  This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes
a hang of the fileystem.

The ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size.  Release the
read semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap()
and ocfs2_fiemap_inline().  This does an unnecessary semaphore lock/unlock
on the last extent but simplifies the error path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 06:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39886 | bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39886</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init()

Currently, calling bpf_map_kmalloc_node() from __bpf_async_init() can
cause various locking issues; see the following stack trace (edited for

...

The above was reproduced on bpf-next (b338cf849ec8) by modifying
./tools/sched_ext/scx_flatcg.bpf.c to call bpf_timer_init() during
ops.runnable(), and hacking the memcg accounting code a bit to make
a bpf_timer_init() call more likely to raise an MEMCG_MAX event.

We have also run into other similar variants (both internally and on
bpf-next), including double-acquiring cgroup_file_kn_lock, the same
worker_pool::lock, etc.

As suggested by Shakeel, fix this by using __GFP_HIGH instead of
GFP_ATOMIC in __bpf_async_init(), so that e.g. if try_charge_memcg()
raises an MEMCG_MAX event, we call __memcg_memory_event() with
@allow_spinning=false and avoid calling cgroup_file_notify() there.

Non-root users with legitimate write access to /etc/asterisk can exploit this behaviour by placing malicious scripts in the startup.d directory, which will then execute with root privileges upon service restart.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 04:35:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9321 | WPCasa &amp;lt;= 1.4.1 - Unauthenticated Code Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9321</link><description>The WPCasa plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.1.

In versions 0.2.0 to 0.38.0, due to a bug in the sandbox configuration logic, Codex CLI could treat a model-generated cwd as the sandbox’s writable root, including paths outside of the folder where the user started their session. This logic bypassed the intended workspace boundary and enables arbitrary file writes and command execution where the Codex process has permissions - this did not impact the network-disabled sandbox restriction. This issue has been patched in Codex CLI 0.39.0 that canonicalizes and validates that the boundary used for sandbox policy is based on where the user started the session, and not the one generated by the model. Users running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced. If using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to 0.4.12 for a fix of the sandbox issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10813 | code-projects Hostel Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10813</link><description>A vulnerability was found in code-projects Hostel Management System 1.0.

In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59527 | FlowiseAI/Flowise has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59527</link><description>Flowise is a drag &amp; drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow.

Prior to version 3.2, a timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client proofs and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1 by replacing Arrays.equals with MessageDigest.isEqual, which ensures constant-time comparison.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:28:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57203 | MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to aut...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57203</link><description>MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to authenticated admin users. The vulnerability resides in the prompt parameter submitted to the /dashboard/user/generator/generate-stream endpoint via a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to insufficient input sanitization, attackers can inject HTML-based JavaScript payloads. This payload is stored and rendered unsanitized in subsequent views, leading to execution in other users' browsers when they access affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate input filtering to prevent such attacks. A fix should include proper sanitization, output encoding, and strong CSP enforcement to mitigate exploitation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59433 | @conventional-changelog/git-client has an Argument Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59433</link><description>Conventional Changelog generates changelogs and release notes from a project's commit messages and metadata. Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10811 | code-projects Hostel Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10811</link><description>A flaw has been found in code-projects Hostel Management System 1.0.

This interface, referred to as the "ATEM Ethernet Protocol 1.0", provides complete device control without requiring credentials or encryption. An attacker on the same network (or with remote access to the exposed port) can exploit this interface to execute arbitrary streaming commands, erase disks, or shut down the device - effectively gaining full remote control.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:42:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57438 | The 2wcom IP-4c 2.15.5 device suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability.

Prior to version 1.6.4, Authlib’s JWS verification accepts tokens that declare unknown critical header parameters (crit), violating RFC 7515 “must‑understand” semantics. An attacker can craft a signed token with a critical header (for example, bork or cnf) that strict verifiers reject but Authlib accepts. In mixed‑language fleets, this enables split‑brain verification and can lead to policy bypass, replay, or privilege escalation.

Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker’s access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59411 | CubeCart Stored/Reflected HTML Injection Vulnerability in Contact Enquiry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59411</link><description>CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution.

Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field. Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display unwanted content.

When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:32:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57602 | Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH priv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57602</link><description>Insufficient hardening of the proxyuser account in the AiKaan IoT management platform, combined with the use of a shared, hardcoded SSH private key, allows remote attackers to authenticate to the cloud controller, gain interactive shell access, and pivot into other connected IoT devices.
