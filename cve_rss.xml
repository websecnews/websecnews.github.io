A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 16:49:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26842 | An issue was discovered in Znuny through 7.1.3.

Betty reported hitting the following warning:

...

It seems we're hitting the error path in virtsnd_probe(), which
triggers a virtsnd_remove() which iterates over the substreams
calling cancel_work_sync() on the elapsed_period work_struct.

Looking at the code, from earlier in:
virtsnd_probe()-&gt;virtsnd_build_devs()-&gt;virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg()

We set snd-&gt;nsubstreams, allocate the snd-&gt;substreams, and if
we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in
virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having
initialized the elapsed_period work_struct.

When that error path unwinds we then call virtsnd_remove()
which as long as the substreams array is allocated, will iterate
through calling cancel_work_sync() on the uninitialized work
struct hitting this warning.

Takashi Iwai suggested this fix, which initializes the substreams
structure right after allocation, so that if we hit the error
paths we avoid trying to cleanup uninitialized data.

Note: I have not yet managed to reproduce the issue myself, so
this patch has had limited testing.

Feedback or thoughts would be appreciated!</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37806 | fs/ntfs3: Keep write operations atomic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37806</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Keep write operations atomic

syzbot reported a NULL pointer dereference in __generic_file_write_iter. [1]

Before the write operation is completed, the user executes ioctl[2] to clear
the compress flag of the file, which causes the is_compressed() judgment to
return 0, further causing the program to enter the wrong process and call the
wrong ops ntfs_aops_cmpr, which triggers the null pointer dereference of
write_begin.

Use inode lock to synchronize ioctl and write to avoid this case.

bpf: Fix kmemleak warning for percpu hashmap

Vlad Poenaru reported the following kmemleak issue:

  unreferenced object 0x606fd7c44ac8 (size 32):
    backtrace (crc 0):

      do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x150
      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

Further investigation shows the reason is due to not 8-byte aligned
store of percpu pointer in htab_elem_set_ptr():
  *(void __percpu **)(l-&gt;key + key_size) = pptr;

Note that the whole htab_elem alignment is 8 (for x86_64). If the key_size
is 4, that means pptr is stored in a location which is 4 byte aligned but
not 8 byte aligned. In mm/kmemleak.c, scan_block() scans the memory based
on 8 byte stride, so it won't detect above pptr, hence reporting the memory
leak.

In htab_map_alloc(), we already have

        htab-&gt;elem_size = sizeof(struct htab_elem) +
                          round_up(htab-&gt;map.key_size, 8);
        if (percpu)
                htab-&gt;elem_size += sizeof(void *);
        else
                htab-&gt;elem_size += round_up(htab-&gt;map.value_size, 8);

So storing pptr with 8-byte alignment won't cause any problem and can fix
kmemleak too.

The issue can be reproduced with bpf selftest as well:
  1. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK config
  2. Add a getchar() before skel destroy in test_hash_map() in prog_tests/for_each.c.
     The purpose is to keep map available so kmemleak can be detected.
  3. run './test_progs -t for_each/hash_map &amp;' and a kmemleak should be reported.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37808 | crypto: null - Use spin lock instead of mutex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37808</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network
traffic, for example using "iperf --bidir" over NCM ethernet link.

The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets
preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock.

usb: xhci: Fix invalid pointer dereference in Etron workaround

This check is performed before prepare_transfer() and prepare_ring(), so
enqueue can already point at the final link TRB of a segment. And indeed
it will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.

Then enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer. It will crash the kernel right
away or load some junk which may look like a link TRB and cause the real
link TRB to be replaced with a NOOP. This wouldn't end well.

Use a functionally equivalent test which doesn't dereference the pointer
and always gives correct result.

   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of
   this "mode" parameter were actually used as an additional way to
   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not
   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.

   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have
   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the
   value of the "hidden" mouse button argument.

   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with
   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/

2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can
   let an attacker simulate "keyboard" input to command line
   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other
   TIOCLINUX "selection mode" IOCTLs.

   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse
   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate
   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI
   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with
   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.

   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to
   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because
   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The
   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,
   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes
   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.

   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/

   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it
   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 ("tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be
   disabled")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with
   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would
   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before
   commit 2f83e38a095f ("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN").

3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or
   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:

   To quote console_codes(4):

     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console
     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these
     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the
     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These
     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application
     such as the gpm(8) daemon.

   Jared Finder has also confirmed in
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/
   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it
   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that
   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Resolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the
generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the
current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using
generic_handle_irq.

A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was
replaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However, this change also causes
the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the
interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped
IRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37816 | mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37816</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use

gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[]
and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length
*without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to
buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:

[   80.842193] memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0

The easiest fix would be to just drop the counted-by but with the exception
of the ack buffer in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only contains enough room
for the packet-header, all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a buffer
of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.

Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split the vsc_tp_packet struct
definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed
size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer
overrun checking still works when enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37817 | mcb: fix a double free bug in chameleon_parse_gdd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37817</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD

LoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot
even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no
mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry
value (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.

The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address
as a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
&amp;&amp; !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a
coincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to
kernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().

Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to
check the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the
entry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULL
instead of the pointer to the slot.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37819 | irqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37819</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/eevdf: Fix se-&gt;slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash

There is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a
sched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.

The offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a
delayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.
In that case:

1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of
   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to
   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then
   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.
2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.
3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration
   tries to dequeue the parent.
4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the
   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.
5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's -&gt;slice to
   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.

This throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic
results. A manifestation we saw in production was:

6. In update_entity_lag(), se-&gt;slice is used to calculate limit, which
   ends up as a huge negative number.
7. limit is used in se-&gt;vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit
   is negative, vlag &gt; limit, so se-&gt;vlag is set to the same huge
   negative number.
8. In place_entity(), se-&gt;vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in
   another huge (positive or negative) number.
9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se-&gt;vruntime, which increases or
   decreases se-&gt;vruntime by a huge number.
10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which
    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the
    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the
    (vruntime - cfs_rq-&gt;min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.
11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.
12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of
    pick_eevdf() and crashes.

Dumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale
huge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se-&gt;slice
being set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually "benign" since
the rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).

Fix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first
non-empty cfs_rq.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37822 | riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37822</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: return EIO on RAID1 block group write pointer mismatch

There was a bug report about a NULL pointer dereference in
__btrfs_add_free_space_zoned() that ultimately happens because a
conversion from the default metadata profile DUP to a RAID1 profile on two
disks.

The stack trace has the following signature:

 BTRFS error (device sdc): zoned: write pointer offset mismatch of zones in raid1 profile

When a RAID1 block-group is created and a write pointer mismatch between
the disks in the RAID set is detected, btrfs sets the alloc_offset to the
length of the block group marking it as full. Afterwards the code expects
that a balance operation will evacuate the data in this block-group and
repair the problems.

But before this is possible, the new space of this block-group will be
accounted in the free space cache. But in __btrfs_

scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()

A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:
once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq-&gt;mq_hctx to
NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in
ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is
dereferenced, the kernel will crash.

Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an
error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer
dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is
removed.

This is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 ("scsi: ufs: core: Fix
ufshcd_abort_one racing issue").

This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37829 | cpufreq: scpi: Fix null-ptr-deref in scpi_cpufreq_get_rate()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: sun50i: prevent out-of-bounds access

A KASAN enabled kernel reports an out-of-bounds access when handling the
nvmem cell in the sun50i cpufreq driver:
==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sun50i_cpufreq_nvmem_probe+0x180/0x3d4
Read of size 4 at addr ffff000006bf31e0 by task kworker/u16:1/38

This is because the DT specifies the nvmem cell as covering only two
bytes, but we use a u32 pointer to read the value. DTs for other SoCs
indeed specify 4 bytes, so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.

Fortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem
cell, in bytes, so we can use that information to only access the valid
portion of the data.
To cover multiple cell sizes, use memcpy() to copy the information into a
zeroed u32 buffer, then also make sure we always read the data in little
endian fashion, as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37833 | net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37833</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads

Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.

Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to
work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.

For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal
trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries'
ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other
registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value
does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up,
so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the
trap.

I can reproduce this issue with the following steps:

1) When a dirty swapcache page is isolated by reclaim process and the
   page isn't locked, inject memory failure for the page. 
   me_swapcache_dirty() clears uptodate flag and tries to delete from lru,
   but fails.  Reclaim process will put the hwpoisoned page back to lru.

2) The process that maps the hwpoisoned page exits, the page is deleted
   the page will never be freed and will be in the lru forever.

3) If we trigger a reclaim again and tries to reclaim the page,
   add_to_swap() will trigger VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO due to the uptodate flag is
   cleared.

To fix it, skip the hwpoisoned page in shrink_folio_list().  Besides, the
hwpoison folio may not be unmapped by hwpoison_user_mappings() yet, unmap
it in shrink_folio_list(), otherwise the folio will fail to be unmaped by
hwpoison_user_mappings() since the folio isn't in lru list.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3419 | Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin &amp;lt;= 4.0.26 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3419</link><description>The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.26 via the proxy_image() function.

Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&amp;`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:27:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32441 | Rack session gets restored after deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32441</link><description>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0936 | On affected platforms running Arista EOS with a gNMI transport enabled, running the gNOI File TransferToRemote RPC with credentials for a remote server may cause these remote-server credentials to be logged or accounted on the local EOS device or possibly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0936</link><description>On affected platforms running Arista EOS with a gNMI transport enabled, running the gNOI File TransferToRemote RPC with credentials for a remote server may cause these remote-server credentials to be logged or accounted on the local EOS device or possibly on other remote accounting servers (i.e. TACACS, RADIUS, etc).</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:08:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-35939 | Craft CMS stores user-provided content session files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-35939</link><description>Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication to the login page and generates a session file on the server at `/var/lib/php/sessions`. Such session files are named `sess_[session_value]`, where `[session_value]` is provided to the client in a `Set-Cookie` response header. Craft CMS stores the return URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location on the server.

Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:45:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20194 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20194</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform an injection attack against an affected device.

Starting in JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.12.1 and prior to version 0.15.4 (corresponding to JRuby versions starting in 9.3.4.0 prior to 9.4.12.1 and 10.0.0.0 prior to 10.0.0.1), when verifying SSL certificates, JRuby-OpenSSL does not verify that the hostname presented in the certificate matches the one the user tries to connect to. This means a man-in-the-middle could just present any valid cert for a completely different domain they own, and JRuby would accept the cert. Anybody using JRuby to make requests of external APIs, or scraping the web, that depends on https to connect securely. JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.15.4 contains a fix for the issue. This fix is included in JRuby versions 10.0.0.1 and 9.4.12.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 16:46:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46827 | Graylog Allows Session Takeover via Insufficient HTML Sanitization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46827</link><description>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Prior to versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0, it is possible to obtain user session cookies by submitting an HTML form as part of an Event Definition Remediation Step field. For this attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account with permissions to create event definitions, while the user must have permissions to view alerts. Additionally, an active Input must be present on the Graylog server that is capable of receiving form data (e.g. a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc). Versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available, as long as the relatively rare prerequisites are met.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 15:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47619 | tranport: TLS host name wildcard matching too lax</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47619</link><description>syslog-ng is an enhanced log daemo.

net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation

In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
I moved cp-&gt;hash calculation before the first
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp-&gt;alloc_hash is left untouched.
This difference could lead to another out of bound access.

cp-&gt;alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should
update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 13:24:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-33093 | IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-33093</link><description>IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.2.2 JWT secret is stored in public Helm Charts and is not stored as a Kubernetes secret.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 11:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4104 | Frontend Dashboard 1.0 - 2.2.6 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post Function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4104</link><description>The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.6.

During unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections.
This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39361 | WordPress Royal Elementor Addons plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.1017 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39361</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WProyal Royal Elementor Addons allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Royal Elementor Addons: from n/a through 1.7.1017.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20980 | Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20980</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20937 | Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20937</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20949 | Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20949</link><description>Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privilege of Samsung Members.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20953 | Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20953</link><description>Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20954 | Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitiv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20954</link><description>Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitive information.

Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur.

This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 17:30:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46736 | Umbraco Makes User Enumeration Feasible Based on Timing of Login Response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46736</link><description>Umbraco is a free and open source .NET content management system.

In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use.

An HTTP header injection vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 15:23:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4373 | Glib: buffer underflow on glib through glib/gstring.c via function g_string_insert_unichar</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4373</link><description>A flaw was found in GLib, which is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the g_string_insert_unichar() function.

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed.

The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the "specific" or the "reflect" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. ("generic" model is not impacted)

Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property "org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:31:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22886 | distributeddatamgr_udmf has a memory leak vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22886</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker case DOS through missing release of memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25052 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has a buffer overflow vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25052</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker cause DOS through buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27132 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27132</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker arbitrary code execution in pre-installed apps through out-of-bounds write.

Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 01:15:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4303 | PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System add-phlebotomist.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4303</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System 1.0.
