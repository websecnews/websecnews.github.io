Further information on this can be found on the website of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). An attacker could theoretically leverage this by delivering a manipulated PDF file to the target, and depending on the environment, various actions can be executed. These actions include:

  *  Reading files from the operating system
  *  Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop
  *  Executing HTTP requests
  *  Loading additional DTDs or XML files
  *  Under certain conditions, executing OS commands</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 13:37:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9139 | OS Command Injection in Restricted Command</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9139</link><description>The affected product permits OS command injection through improperly restricted commands, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 08:40:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43701 | GPU DDK - PowerVR: TLB invalidate UAF of dma_buf imported into multiple GPU devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43701</link><description>Software installed and run as a non-privileged user may conduct GPU system calls to read and write freed physical memory from the GPU.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 08:19:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46911 | Apache Roller: Weakness in CSRF protection allows privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46911</link><description>Cross-site Resource Forgery (CSRF), Privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Roller. On multi-blog/user Roller websites, by default weblog owners are trusted to publish arbitrary weblog content and this combined with a deficiency in Roller's CSRF protections allowed an escalation of privileges attack. This issue affects Apache Roller before 6.1.4.

Roller users who run multi-blog/user Roller websites are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.4, which fixes the issue.
