Prior to version 0.5.3, a security vulnerability exists in the Mermaid diagram rendering component that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Due to the exposure of the Electron IPC renderer to the DOM, this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw escalates to full Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. Two concurrent issues, unsafe Mermaid configuration and an exposed IPC interface, cause this issue. Version 0.5.3 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67751 | ChurchCRM has SQL Injection in Event Editor via `EN_tyid` Parameter caused by an Incomplete Fix</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67751</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `EventEditor.php` file. When creating a new event and selecting an event type, the `EN_tyid` POST parameter is not sanitized. This allows an authenticated user with event management permissions (`isAddEvent`) to execute arbitrary SQL queries. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67874 | ChurchCRM has plaintext password return in response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67874</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, the application echoes back plaintext passwords submitted by users in subsequent HTTP responses. This information disclosure significantly increases the risk of credential compromise and may amplify the impact of other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, IDOR, session fixation), enabling attackers to harvest other users’ passwords. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68113 | ALTCHA Proof-of-Work Vulnerable to Challenge Splicing and Replay</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68113</link><description>ALTCHA is privacy-first software for captcha and bot protection. A cryptographic semantic binding flaw in ALTCHA libraries allows challenge payload splicing, which may enable replay attacks. The HMAC signature does not unambiguously bind challenge parameters to the nonce, allowing an attacker to reinterpret a valid proof-of-work submission with a modified expiration value. This may allow previously solved challenges to be reused beyond their intended lifetime, depending on server-side replay handling and deployment assumptions. The vulnerability primarily impacts abuse-prevention mechanisms such as rate limiting and bot mitigation. It does not directly affect data confidentiality or integrity. This issue has been addressed by enforcing explicit semantic separation between challenge parameters and the nonce during HMAC computation. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions, which include version 1.0.0 of the altcha Golang package, version 1.0.0 of the altcha Rubygem, version 1.0.0 of the altcha pip package, version 1.0.0 of the altcha Erlang package, version 1.4.1 of the altcha-lib npm package, version 1.3.1 of the altcha-org/altcha Composer package, and version 1.3.0 of the org.altcha:altcha Maven package. As a mitigation, implementations may append a delimiter to the end of the `salt` value prior to HMAC computation (for example, `?expires=&lt;time&gt;&amp;`). This prevents ambiguity between parameters and the nonce and is backward-compatible with existing implementations, as the delimiter is treated as a standard URL parameter separator.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68115 | Parse Server vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Mustache Template Variables</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68115</link><description>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

In versions prior to 0.16.0, the endpoint `/upload` allows an authenticated user to write arbitrary files on the system, overwriting binaries and allowing code execution. The upload function takes `file.name` directly from user supplied data without doing any sanitization on the name thus allowing for arbitrary file write. This can be used to overwrite system binaries with ones provided from an attacker allowing full code execution. Version 0.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67492 | Weblate&amp;#x27;s over‑permissive webhook endpoint enables mass repository updates and component enumeration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67492</link><description>Weblate is a web based localization tool.

Prior to versions 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 of the FreePBX framework, an authenticated local privilege escalation exists in the deprecated FreePBX startup script `amportal`. In the deprecated `amportal` utility, the lookup for the `freepbx_engine` file occurs in `/etc/asterisk/` directories. Typically, these are configured by FreePBX as writable by the **asterisk** user and any members of the **asterisk** group. This means that a member of the **asterisk** group can add their own `freepbx_engine` file in `/etc/asterisk/` and upon `amportal` executing, it would exec that file with root permissions (even though the file was created and placed by a non-root user). Version 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 contain a fix for the issue. Other mitigation strategies are also available. Confirm only trusted local OS system users are members of the `asterisk` group. Look for suspicious files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory (via Admin -&gt; Config Edit in the GUI, or via CLI). Double-check that `live_dangerously = no` is set (or unconfigured, as the default is **no**) in `/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf` file. Eliminate any unsafe custom use of Asterisk dial plan applications and functions that potentially can manipulate the file system, e.g., System(), FILE(), etc.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67735 | Netty has a CRLF Injection vulnerability in io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67735</link><description>Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection. Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67736 | Authenticated SQL Injection in FreePBX tts (Text To Speech) module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67736</link><description>The FreePBX module tts (Text to Speech) for FreePBX, an open-source web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that manages Asterisk. Versions prior to 16.0.5 and 17.0.5 are vulnerable to SQL injection by authenticated users with administrator access. Authenticated users with administrative access to the Administrator Control Panel (ACP) can leverage this SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database and execute code on the system as the `asterisk` user with chained elevation to `root` privileges. Users should upgrade to version 16.0.5 or 17.0.5 to receive a fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67747 | Fickling has missing detection for marshal.loads and types.FunctionType in unsafe modules list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67747</link><description>Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Versions prior to 0.1.6 are missing `marshal` and `types` from the block list of unsafe module imports. Fickling started blocking both modules to address this issue. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious pickle file that can bypass fickling since it misses detections for `types.FunctionType` and `marshal.loads`. A user who deserializes such a file, believing it to be safe, would inadvertently execute arbitrary code on their system. This impacts any user or system that uses Fickling to vet pickle files for security issues. The issue was fixed in version 0.1.6.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67748 | Fickling has Code Injection vulnerability via pty.spawn()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67748</link><description>Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer.

The Create Component functionality in Weblate allows authorized users to add new translation components by specifying both a version control system and a source code repository URL to pull from. However, prior to version 5.15, the repository URL field is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary protocols, hostnames, and IP addresses, including localhost, internal network addresses, and local filenames. When the Mercurial version control system is selected, Weblate exposes the full server-side HTTP response for the provided URL. This effectively creates a server-side request forgery (SSRF) primitive that can probe internal services and return their contents. In addition to accessing internal HTTP endpoints, the behavior also enables local file enumeration by attempting file:// requests. While file contents may not always be returned, the application’s error messages clearly differentiate between files that exist and files that do not, revealing information about the server’s filesystem layout. In cloud environments, this behavior is particularly dangerous, as internal-only endpoints such as cloud metadata services may be accessible, potentially leading to credential disclosure and full environment compromise. This has been addressed in the Weblate 5.15 release. As a workaround, remove Mercurial from `VCS_BACKENDS`; the Git backend is not affected. The Git backend was already configured to block the file protocol and does not expose the HTTP response content in the error message.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 23:52:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9456 | SLDPRT File Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9456</link><description>A maliciously crafted SLDPRT file, when parsed through certain Autodesk products, can force a Memory corruption vulnerability.

Attackers who use an untrusted reverse proxy or not using a reverse proxy at all can bypass IP rate limiting by adding a forged X-Forwarded-For header. Starting with version 2025.9.1, an option (`trustProxy`) has been added in config file to prevent this from happening. However, it is initialized with an insecure default value before version 2025.12.0-alpha.2, making it still vulnerable if the configuration is not set correctly. This is patched in v2025.12.0-alpha.2 by flipping default value of `trustProxy` to `false`. Users of a trusted reverse proxy who are unsure if they manually overode this value should check their config for optimal behavior. Users are running Misskey with a trusted reverse proxy should not be affected by this vulnerability. From v2025.9.1 to v2025.11.1, workaround is available. Set `trustProxy: false` in config file.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 23:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58173 | FreshRSS vulnerable to authenticated RCE via path traversal inside include()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58173</link><description>FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator.

This could allow an attacker to read potentially sensitive data or possibly cause a denial-of-service by writing malformed data to certain gRPC endpoints. This flaw has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3, and customers should consider upgrading to 1.3.3 as soon as possible.
The flaw is due to a misconfiguration in the Istio Gateway, which manages authentication and authorization for the affected endpoints. The security policy relies on an explicit definition of required permissions in the Istio Gateway configuration, and the affected endpoints were not defined in the configuration. This allowed requests to bypass both authentication and authorization within a Hybrid Manager service.
All versions of Hybrid Manager - LTS should be upgraded to 1.3.3, and all versions of Hybrid Manager - Innovation should be upgraded to 2025.12.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:26:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66438 | A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in the Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0 Print Format rendering mechanism. Specifi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66438</link><description>A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in the Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0 Print Format rendering mechanism. Specifically, the API frappe.www.printview.get_html_and_style() triggers the rendering of the html field inside a Print Format document using frappe.render_template(template, doc) via the get_rendered_template() call chain. Although ERPNext wraps Jinja2 in a SandboxedEnvironment, it exposes sensitive functions such as frappe.db.sql through get_safe_globals(). An authenticated attacker with permission to create or modify a Print Format can inject arbitrary Jinja expressions into the html field. Once the malicious Print Format is saved, the attacker can call get_html_and_style() with a target document (e.g., Supplier or Sales Invoice) to trigger the render process. This leads to information disclosure from the database, such as database version, schema details, or sensitive values, depending on the injected payload. Exploitation flow: Create a Print Format with SSTI payload in the html field; call the get_html_and_style() API; triggers frappe.render_template(template, doc) inside get_rendered_template(); leaks database information via frappe.db.sql or other exposed globals.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66436 | An SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability exists in the get_terms_and_conditions method of Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0.

By injecting SQL through the LinkName/URI value, a remote attacker can control the FileName field used by the server to read and return files from disk, resulting in arbitrary local file disclosure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:03:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34180 | NetSupport Manager &amp;lt; 14.12.0001 Gateway Key Reversible Encoding Credential Recovery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34180</link><description>NetSupport Manager &lt; 14.12.0001  relies on a shared Gateway Key for authentication between Manager/Control, Client, and Connectivity Server components. The key is stored using a reversible encoding scheme. An attacker who obtains access to a deployed client configuration file can decode the stored value to recover the plaintext Gateway Key. Possession of the Gateway Key allows unauthorized access to NetSupport Manager connectivity services and enables remote control of systems managed through the same key.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:03:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34181 | NetSupport Manager &amp;lt; 14.12.0001 Authenticated Path Traversal Arbitrary File Write RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34181</link><description>NetSupport Manager &lt; 14.12.0001 contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability in its Connectivity Server/Gateway PUTFILE request handler. An attacker with a valid Gateway Key can supply a crafted filename containing directory traversal sequences to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This can be leveraged to place attacker-controlled DLLs or executables in privileged paths and achieve remote code execution in the context of the NetSupport Manager connectivity service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:03:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34411 | Convercent Whistleblowing Platform Unauthenticated GetLegalEntity Endpoint Enables Customer Enumeration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34411</link><description>The Convercent Whistleblowing Platform operated by EQS Group exposes an unauthenticated API endpoint at /GetLegalEntity that returns internal customer legal-entity names based on a supplied searchText fragment.

By default, affected deployments omit HTTP security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy, and implement incomplete clickjacking protections. The application also issues session cookies with insecure or inconsistent attributes by default, including duplicate ASP.NET_SessionId values, an affinity cookie missing the Secure attribute, and mixed or absent SameSite settings. These deficiencies weaken browser-side isolation and session integrity, increasing exposure to client-side attacks, session fixation, and cross-site session leakage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:03:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12900 | FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders &amp;amp; File Manager &amp;lt;= 6.5.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Author+) Global Folders Tampering</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12900</link><description>The FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders &amp; File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.1 via the "ConvertController::insertToNewTable" function due to missing validation on a user controlled key.

This can cause the output byte array to be truncated, discarding the first NUL byte and all subsequent characters, and thereby exposing a possible buffer over-read problem. This issue is fixed in Eclipse OMR version 0.8.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:44:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14706 | Shiguangwu sgwbox N3 NETREBOOT http_eshell_server command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14706</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in Shiguangwu sgwbox N3 2.0.25.
