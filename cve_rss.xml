In versions prior to 4.9.7, a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header was also included. According to the HTTP specification, `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request`, so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment. If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests, this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification, ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7, and all users should upgrade immediately.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 13:32:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59054 | dstack has insecure LUKS2 persistent storage partitions that may be opened and used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59054</link><description>dstack is a software development kit (SDK) to simplify the deployment of arbitrary containerized apps into trusted execution environments. In versions of dstack prior to 0.5.4, a malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 data volume to a dstack CVM for use as the `/data` mount. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key known to the attacker, causing disclosure of Wireguard keys and other secret information. The attacker can also pre-load data on the device, which could potentially compromise guest execution. LUKS2 volume metadata is not authenticated and supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume such that the volume opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase or token, records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known key), and/or contains arbitrary data chosen by the attacker. Version 0.5.4 of dstack contains a patch that addresses LUKS headers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 13:02:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10318 | JeecgBoot WebSocket Message sendWebSocketMsg improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10318</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in JeecgBoot up to 3.8.2.

Attackers could potentially use this vulnerability to change the balance on the cards and generate money. The account balance is stored on an insecure MiFare Classic NFC card and can be read and written back. By carefully observing changes in card dumps, one can identify fields that store the cash value of the card. Additionally, a checksum can be identified, which is created by XOR-ing the cash and an unknown field with a certain value. By updating the fields accordingly, arbitrary amounts of money can be loaded onto the card (up to $655,35) to pay for goods.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 11:28:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6638 | Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in huggingface/transformers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6638</link><description>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically affecting the MarianTokenizer's `remove_language_code()` method.

A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`
2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same
   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set
3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path='/'`).
   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer
   boundary

The bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to
the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the
secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents
immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.

The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of
the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding
it on an insecure host should not be okay.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 05:19:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10288 | roncoo roncoo-pay list improper authentication</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10288</link><description>A vulnerability was found in roncoo roncoo-pay up to 9428382af21cd5568319eae7429b7e1d0332ff40.

In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path, the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable, and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping), and then directly renders it using v-html, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API, which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus, the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 18:38:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8061 | A potential insufficient access control vulnerability was reported in the Lenovo Dispatcher 3.0 and Dispatcher 3.1 drivers used by some Leno...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8061</link><description>A potential insufficient access control vulnerability was reported in the Lenovo Dispatcher 3.0 and Dispatcher 3.1 drivers used by some Lenovo consumer notebooks that could allow an authenticated local user to execute code with elevated privileges.

mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lock

When netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holding
kmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lock
inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because
pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to
__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire
kmemleak_lock.

This is the path for the deadlock.

mem_pool_alloc()
  -&gt; raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;kmemleak_lock, flags);
      -&gt; pr_warn_once()
          -&gt; netconsole subsystem
	     -&gt; netpoll
	         -&gt; __alloc_skb
		   -&gt; __create_object
		     -&gt; raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;kmemleak_lock, flags);

Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() after
kmemleak_lock is released.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39737 | mm/kmemleak: avoid soft lockup in __kmemleak_do_cleanup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39737</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/kmemleak: avoid soft lockup in __kmemleak_do_cleanup()

A soft lockup warning was observed on a relative small system x86-64
system with 16 GB of memory when running a debug kernel with kmemleak
enabled.

  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#8 stuck for 33s! [kworker/8:1:134]

The test system was running a workload with hot unplug happening in
parallel.  Then kemleak decided to disable itself due to its inability to
allocate more kmemleak objects.  The debug kernel has its
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE set to 40,000.

The soft lockup happened in kmemleak_do_cleanup() when the existing
kmemleak objects were being removed and deleted one-by-one in a loop via a
workqueue.  In this particular case, there are at least 40,000 objects
that need to be processed and given the slowness of a debug kernel and the
fact that a raw_spinlock has to be acquired and released in
__delete_object(), it could take a while to properly handle all these
objects.

As kmemleak has been disabled in this case, the object removal and
deletion process can be further optimized as locking isn't really needed. 
However, it is probably not worth the effort to optimize for such an edge
case that should rarely happen.  So the simple solution is to call
cond_resched() at periodic interval in the iteration loop to avoid soft
lockup.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39738 | btrfs: do not allow relocation of partially dropped subvolumes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39738</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

 BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -117)
 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6963 at ../fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2168 btrfs_run_delayed_refs+0xfa/0x110 [btrfs]

And btrfs check doesn't report anything wrong related to the extent
tree.

[CAUSE]
The cause is a little complex, firstly the extent tree indeed doesn't
have the backref for 594526208.

The extent tree only have the following two backrefs around that bytenr
on-disk:

        item 65 key (594509824 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13880 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197740 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE
        item 66 key (594558976 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13847 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197522 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE

But the such missing backref item is not an corruption on disk, as the
offending delayed ref belongs to subvolume 934, and that subvolume is
being dropped:

        item 0 key (934 ROOT_ITEM 198229) itemoff 15844 itemsize 439
                generation 198229 root_dirid 256 bytenr 10741039104 byte_limit 0 bytes_used 345571328
                last_snapshot 198229 flags 0x1000000000001(RDONLY) refs 0
                drop_progress key (206324 EXTENT_DATA 2711650304) drop_level 2
                level 2 generation_v2 198229

And that offending tree block 594526208 is inside the dropped range of
that subvolume.  That explains why there is no backref item for that
bytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.

But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan
subvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.

So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and
balance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we
shouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.

The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.
In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same
problem.

It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and
caused those zombie subvolumes.

Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 ("btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot
deletion not triggered on mount") has long fixed the bug.

[ENHANCEMENT]
For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.

Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref
time) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too
late.

Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the
earliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging
similar bugs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39739 | iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Add SM6115 MDSS compatible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39739</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

During rcu_read_unlock_special(), if this happens during irq_exit(), we

the irq_exit() path causing a recursive lock up.

This is precisely what Xiongfeng found when invoking a BPF program on

managing the irq_work state correctly.

tick_irq_exit(). It will hang on boot without the patch:

  static inline void tick_irq_exit(void)

bpf: Forget ranges when refining tnum after JSET

Syzbot reported a kernel warning due to a range invariant violation on
the following BPF program.

  0: call bpf_get_netns_cookie
  1: if r0 == 0 goto 
  2: if r0 &amp; Oxffffffff goto 

The issue is on the path where we fall through both jumps.

That path is unreachable at runtime: after insn 1, we know r0 != 0, but
with the sign extension on the jset, we would only fallthrough insn 2
if r0 == 0. Unfortunately, is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to
figure this out, so the verifier walks all branches. The verifier then
refines the register bounds using the second condition and we end
up with inconsistent bounds on this unreachable path:

  1: if r0 == 0 goto 
    r0: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0xffffffffffffffff)
  2: if r0 &amp; 0xffffffff goto 
    r0 before reg_bounds_sync: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0)
    r0 after reg_bounds_sync:  u64=[0x1, 0] var_off=(0, 0)

Improving the range refinement for JSET to cover all cases is tricky. We
also don't expect many users to rely on JSET given LLVM doesn't generate
those instructions. So instead of improving the range refinement for
JSETs, Eduard suggested we forget the ranges whenever we're narrowing
tnums after a JSET. This patch implements that approach.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39749 | rcu: Protect -&amp;gt;defer_qs_iw_pending from data race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39749</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Protect -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending from data race

On kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is
invoked within an interrupts-disabled region of code [1], it will invoke
rcu_read_unlock_special(), which uses an irq-work handler to force the
system to notice when the RCU read-side critical section actually ends.
That end won't happen until interrupts are enabled at the soonest.

In some kernels, such as those booted with rcutree.use_softirq=y, the
irq-work handler is used unconditionally.

The per-CPU rcu_data structure's -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending field is
updated by the irq-work handler and is both read and updated by
rcu_read_unlock_special().  This resulted in the following KCSAN splat:

The problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which
means that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,
and that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical
section, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict
KCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on
the -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending field.

This commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending
field.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39750 | wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39750</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails

Currently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(),
the tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding
TID is not actually allocated. Proceed to
ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid,
which might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential
crash or out-of-bounds access.

Hence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only
the successfully allocated TIDs.

Also, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(),
as decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.

fs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX

When sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816
as set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near
the limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed
INT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288

This happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the
requested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is
not flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.

Specifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a
process calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:
- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes
- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB
- Total allocation size: &gt; 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)

Reproducer:
1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:
   # echo 1073741816 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/nr_open

2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:
   #include 
   #include resource.h&gt;

   int main() {
       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};
       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &amp;amp;rlim);
       dup2(2, 1073741880);  / Triggers the warning
       return 0;
   }

3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027

systemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the
maximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory
control groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits
since memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked
that:

1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum
   size regardless of memcg accounting
2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can
   inadvertently trigger massive allocations
3. The resulting allocations (&gt;8GB) are impractical and will always fail

systemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value
until the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open
being set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file
descriptors.

While processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal
operation, certain selftests (like
tools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file
descriptor limits can trigger this issue.

Fix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested
allocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to
fail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the
impractical &gt;8GB memory allocation request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39757 | ALSA: usb-audio: Validate UAC3 cluster segment descriptors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39757</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix the sendmsg byte count in siw_tcp_sendpages

Ever since commit c2ff29e99a76 ("siw: Inline do_tcp_sendpages()"),
we have been doing this:

static int siw_tcp_sendpages(struct socket *s, struct page **page, int offset,
                             size_t size)
[...]
        /* Calculate the number of bytes we need to push, for this page
         * specifically */
        size_t bytes = min_t(size_t, PAGE_SIZE - offset, size);
        /* If we can't splice it, then copy it in, as normal */
        if (!sendpage_ok(page[i]))
                msg.msg_flags &amp;= ~MSG_SPLICE_PAGES;
        /* Set the bvec pointing to the page, with len $bytes */
        bvec_set_page(&amp;amp;bvec, page[i], bytes, offset);
        /* Set the iter to $size, aka the size of the whole sendpages (!!!) */
        iov_iter_bvec(&amp;amp;msg.msg_iter, ITER_SOURCE, &amp;amp;bvec, 1, size);
try_page_again:
        lock_sock(sk);
        /* Sendmsg with $size size (!!!) */
        rv = tcp_sendmsg_locked(sk, &amp;amp;msg, size);

This means we've been sending oversized iov_iters and tcp_sendmsg calls
for a while. This has a been a benign bug because sendpage_ok() always
returned true. With the recent slab allocator changes being slowly
introduced into next (that disallow sendpage on large kmalloc
allocations), we have recently hit out-of-bounds crashes, due to slight
differences in iov_iter behavior between the MSG_SPLICE_PAGES and
"regular" copy paths:

(MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_splice_from_iter
  iov_iter_extract_pages
    iov_iter_extract_bvec_pages
      uses i-&gt;nr_segs to correctly stop in its tracks before OoB'ing everywhere
  skb_splice_from_iter gets a "short" read

(!MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_copy_to_page_nocache copy=iov_iter_count
 [...]
   copy_from_iter
        /* this doesn't help */
        if (unlikely(iter-&gt;count &lt; len))
                len = iter-&gt;count;
          iterate_bvec
            ... and we run off the bvecs

Fix this by properly setting the iov_iter's byte count, plus sending the
correct byte count to tcp_sendmsg_locked.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39759 | btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the
rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from
the fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree rbtree.

This happens as follows:

1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -&gt; btrfs_qgroup_rescan();

2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that
   point fs_info-&gt;qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by
   task A);

3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups
   from fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock;

4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating
   the fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock,
   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding
   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by taking fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().
Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas
were already disabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39760 | usb: core: config: Prevent OOB read in SS endpoint companion parsing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39760</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered

If a synchronous error is detected as a result of user-space process
triggering a 2-bit uncorrected error, the CPU will take a synchronous
error exception such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64. The
kernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related
page, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that
a system wide panic can be avoided.

However, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal
synchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like
invalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,
invalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will
trigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform
firmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a
system reboot.

Fix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued
for synchronous errors.

net/sched: Make cake_enqueue return NET_XMIT_CN when past buffer_limit

The following setup can trigger a WARNING in htb_activate due to
the condition: !cl-&gt;leaf.q-&gt;q.qlen

tc qdisc del dev lo root
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 \

tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle f: \
       cake memlimit 1b
ping -I lo -f -c1 -s64 -W0.001 127.0.0.1

This is because the low memlimit leads to a low buffer_limit, which
causes packet dropping. However, cake_enqueue still returns
NET_XMIT_SUCCESS, causing htb_enqueue to call htb_activate with an
empty child qdisc. We should return NET_XMIT_CN when packets are
dropped from the same tin and flow.

I do not believe return value of NET_XMIT_CN is necessary for packet
drops in the case of ack filtering, as that is meant to optimize
performance, not to signal congestion.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39767 | LoongArch: Optimize module load time by optimizing PLT/GOT counting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39767</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

After analysis, this is because the slow speed of loading the amdgpu
module leads to the long time occupation of the cpu and then the soft
deadlock.

When loading a module, module_frob_arch_sections() tries to figure out
the number of PLTs/GOTs that will be needed to handle all the RELAs. It
will call the count_max_entries() to find in an out-of-order date which
counting algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.

To make it faster, we sort the relocation list by info and addend. That
way, to check for a duplicate relocation, it just needs to compare with
the previous entry. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n
 log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb ("arm64/module: Optimize module
load time by optimizing PLT counting"). This gives sinificant reduction
in module load time for modules with large number of relocations.

After applying this patch, the soft deadlock problem has been solved,
and the kernel starts normally without "Call Trace".

Using the default configuration to test some modules, the results are as
follows:

Module              Size
ip_tables           36K
fat                 143K
radeon              2.5MB
amdgpu              16MB

Without this patch:
Module              Module load time (ms)	Count(PLTs/GOTs)

fat                 0				162/14

net/mlx5: HWS, fix complex rules rehash error flow

Moving rules from matcher to matcher should not fail.
However, if it does fail due to various reasons, the error flow
should allow the kernel to continue functioning (albeit with broken
steering rules) instead of going into series of soft lock-ups or
some other problematic behaviour.

Similar to the simple rules, complex rules rehash logic suffers
from the same problems. This patch fixes the error flow for moving
complex rules:
 - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not
   poll for completion
 - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying
   to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken,
   completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence.
 - If some other completion with error received, don't give up.
   Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage.
 - Make sure that the first error code that was received will
   be actually returned to the caller instead of replacing it
   with the generic error code.

All the aforementioned issues stem from the same bad error flow,
so no point fixing them one by one and leaving partially broken
code - fixing them in one patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39769 | bnxt_en: Fix lockdep warning during rmmod</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39769</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix lockdep warning during rmmod

The commit under the Fixes tag added a netdev_assert_locked() in
bnxt_free_ntp_fltrs().  The lock should be held during normal run-time
but the assert will be triggered (see below) during bnxt_remove_one()
which should not need the lock.  The netdev is already unregistered by
then.  Fix it by calling netdev_assert_locked_or_invisible() which will
not assert if the netdev is unregistered.

net: gso: Forbid IPv6 TSO with extensions on devices with only IPV6_CSUM

When performing Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) on an IPv6 packet that
contains extension headers, the kernel incorrectly requests checksum offload
if the egress device only advertises NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM feature, which has
a strict contract: it supports checksum offload only for plain TCP or UDP
over IPv6 and explicitly does not support packets with extension headers.
The current GSO logic violates this contract by failing to disable the feature
for packets with extension headers, such as those used in GREoIPv6 tunnels.

This violation results in the device being asked to perform an operation
it cannot support, leading to a `skb_warn_bad_offload` warning and a collapse
of network throughput. While device TSO/USO is correctly bypassed in favor
of software GSO for these packets, the GSO stack must be explicitly told not
to request checksum offload.

Mask NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM, NETIF_F_TSO6 and NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_L4
in gso_features_check if the IPv6 header contains extension headers to compute
checksum in software.

The exception is a BIG TCP extension, which, as stated in commit
68e068cabd2c6c53 ("net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets"):
"The feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO.
The header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump,
and not transmitted by physical devices."

When stress-testing the system by repeatedly unbinding and binding the ADC
device in a loop, and the ADC is a supplier for another device (e.g., a
thermal hardware block that reads temperature through the ADC), it may
happen that the ADC device is runtime-resumed immediately after runtime PM
is enabled, triggered by its consumer. At this point, since drvdata is not
yet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can
occur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39775 | mm/mremap: fix WARN with uffd that has remap events disabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39775</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The underlying issue is that we recurse during the original page table
move, but not during the recovery move.

Fix it by checking for both VMAs and performing the check before the
pmd_none() sanity check.

Add a new helper where we perform+document that check for the PMD and PUD
level.

mm/debug_vm_pgtable: clear page table entries at destroy_args()

The mm/debug_vm_pagetable test allocates manually page table entries for
the tests it runs, using also its manually allocated mm_struct.  That in
itself is ok, but when it exits, at destroy_args() it fails to clear those
entries with the *_clear functions.

The problem is that leaves stale entries.  If another process allocates an
mm_struct with a pgd at the same address, it may end up running into the
stale entry.  This is happening in practice on a debug kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE=y, for example this is the output with some extra
debugging I added (it prints a warning trace if pgtables_bytes goes

btrfs: subpage: keep TOWRITE tag until folio is cleaned

btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() calls folio_start_writeback() the first time
a folio is written back, and it also clears the PAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE tag
even if there are still dirty blocks in the folio. This can break ordering
guarantees, such as those required by btrfs_wait_ordered_extents().

That ordering breakage leads to a real failure. For example, running
generic/464 on a zoned setup will hit the following ASSERT. This happens
because the broken ordering fails to flush existing dirty pages before the
file size is truncated.

Consider process A calling writepages() with WB_SYNC_NONE. In zoned mode or
for compressed writes, it locks several folios for delalloc and starts
writing them out. Let's call the last locked folio folio X. Suppose the
write range only partially covers folio X, leaving some pages dirty.
Process A calls btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() when building a bio. This
function call clears the TOWRITE tag of folio X, whose size = 8K and
the block size = 4K. It is following state.

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY)
   &lt;-----&gt; Process A will write this range.

Now suppose process B concurrently calls writepages() with WB_SYNC_ALL. It
calls tag_pages_for_writeback() to tag dirty folios with
PAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE. Since folio X is still dirty, it gets tagged. Then,
B collects tagged folios using filemap_get_folios_tag() and must wait for
folio X to be written before returning from writepages().

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY|TOWRITE)

However, between tagging and collecting, process A may call
btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() and clear folio X's TOWRITE tag.
   0     4K    8K
   |     |/////|  (flag: DIRTY|WRITEBACK, tag: DIRTY)

As a result, process B won't see folio X in its batch, and returns without
waiting for it. This breaks the WB_SYNC_ALL ordering requirement.

Fix this by using btrfs_subpage_set_writeback_keepwrite(), which retains
the TOWRITE tag. We now manually clear the tag only after the folio becomes
clean, via the xas operation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39780 | sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39780</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()

Both jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() and jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list()
periodically release j_list_lock after processing a batch of buffers to
avoid long hold times on the j_list_lock. However, since both functions
contend for j_list_lock, the combined time spent waiting and processing
can be significant.

jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() explicitly calls cond_resched() when
need_resched() is true to avoid softlockups during prolonged operations.
But jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() only exits its loop when need_resched() is
true, relying on potentially sleeping functions like __flush_batch() or
wait_on_buffer() to trigger rescheduling. If those functions do not sleep,
the kernel may hit a softlockup.

This is because the left hand side of the shift is 1, which is of type
int, i.e. 31 bits wide. Shifting by more than that width results in
undefined behaviour.

Fix this by switching to the BIT() macro, which applies correct type
casting as required. This ensures the correct value is written to
UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE (0xffffffff on gs101), and it also fixes a UBSAN shift
warning:

    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/ufs/host/ufs-exynos.c:1113:21
    shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

For consistency, apply the same change to the nutmrs / UTMRL_NEXUS_TYPE

bus: mhi: host: Detect events pointing to unexpected TREs

When a remote device sends a completion event to the host, it contains a
pointer to the consumed TRE. The host uses this pointer to process all of
the TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer.
This works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can
lead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element
transaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the
host's read pointer.

For instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is
updating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old
TRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer
pointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.

This behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without
'commit 6f18d174b73d ("bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer
is written")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before
updating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to
access the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the
chance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an
event pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed
one, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all
of the TREs in between the two read pointers.

This commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the
event points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.

dm: dm-crypt: Do not partially accept write BIOs with zoned targets

Read and write operations issued to a dm-crypt target may be split
according to the dm-crypt internal limits defined by the max_read_size
and max_write_size module parameters (default is 128 KB). The intent is
to improve processing time of large BIOs by splitting them into smaller
operations that can be parallelized on different CPUs.

For zoned dm-crypt targets, this BIO splitting is still done but without
the parallel execution to ensure that the issuing order of write
operations to the underlying devices remains sequential. However, the
splitting itself causes other problems:

1) Since dm-crypt relies on the block layer zone write plugging to
   handle zone append emulation using regular write operations, the
   reminder of a split write BIO will always be plugged into the target
   zone write plugged. Once the on-going write BIO finishes, this
   reminder BIO is unplugged and issued from the zone write plug work.
   If this reminder BIO itself needs to be split, the reminder will be
   re-issued and plugged again, but that causes a call to a
   blk_queue_enter(), which may block if a queue freeze operation was
   initiated. This results in a deadlock as DM submission still holds
   BIOs that the queue freeze side is waiting for.

2) dm-crypt relies on the emulation done by the block layer using
   regular write operations for processing zone append operations. This
   still requires to properly return the written sector as the BIO
   sector of the original BIO. However, this can be done correctly only
   and only if there is a single clone BIO used for processing the
   original zone append operation issued by the user. If the size of a
   zone append operation is larger than dm-crypt max_write_size, then
   the orginal BIO will be split and processed as a chain of regular
   write operations. Such chaining result in an incorrect written sector
   being returned to the zone append issuer using the original BIO
   sector.  This in turn results in file system data corruptions using
   xfs or btrfs.

Fix this by modifying get_max_request_size() to always return the size
of the BIO to avoid it being split with dm_accpet_partial_bio() in
crypt_map(). get_max_request_size() is renamed to
get_max_request_sectors() to clarify the unit of the value returned
and its interface is changed to take a struct dm_target pointer and a
pointer to the struct bio being processed. In addition to this change,
to ensure that crypt_alloc_buffer() works correctly, set the dm-crypt
device max_hw_sectors limit to be at most
BIO_MAX_VECS &lt;&lt; PAGE_SECTORS_SHIFT (1 MB with a 4KB page architecture).
This forces DM core to split write BIOs before passing them to
crypt_map(), and thus guaranteeing that dm-crypt can always accept an
entire write BIO without needing to split it.

This change does not have any effect on the read path of dm-crypt. Read
operations can still be split and the BIO fragments processed in
parallel. There is also no impact on the performance of the write path
given that all zone write BIOs were already processed inline instead of
in parallel.

This change also does not affect in any way regular dm-crypt block
devices.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:09:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26499 | Under heavy system utilization a random race condition can occur during authentication or token refresh operation.

x86/vmscape: Add conditional IBPB mitigation

VMSCAPE is a vulnerability that exploits insufficient branch predictor
isolation between a guest and a userspace hypervisor (like QEMU). Existing
mitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace
can additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a
VMexit.

Since it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,
conditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to
userspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and
userspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.

This new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For
instance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to
get an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the
IBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running
userspace.

The intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.

Angular uses a DI container (the "platform injector") to hold request-specific state during server-side rendering. For historical reasons, the container was stored as a JavaScript module-scoped global variable. When multiple requests are processed concurrently, they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state. In practical terms, this can lead to one request responding with data meant for a completely different request, leaking data or tokens included on the rendered page or in response headers. As long as an attacker had network access to send any traffic that received a rendered response, they may have been able to send a large number of requests and then inspect the responses for information leaks. The APIs `bootstrapApplication`, `getPlatform`, and `destroyPlatform` were vulnerable and required SSR-only breaking changes.
The issue has been patched in all active release lines as well as in the v21 prerelease. Patched packages include `@angular/platform-server` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.15, and 18.2.14 and `@angular/ssr` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.16, and 18.2.21. Several workarounds are available. Disable SSR via Server Routes or builder options, remove any asynchronous behavior from custom `bootstrap` functions, remove uses of `getPlatform()` in application code, and/or ensure that the server build defines `ngJitMode` as false.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 20:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45669 | IBM Security Verify Information Queue denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45669</link><description>IBM Security Verify Information Queue 10.0.5, 10.0.6, 10.0.7, and 10.0.8 could allow a remote user to cause a denial of service due to improper handling of special characters that could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 20:16:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45671 | IBM Security Verify Information Queue information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45671</link><description>IBM Security Verify Information Queue 10.0.5, 10.0.6, 10.0.7, and 10.0.8

In versions 1.11.3 and prior, the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks, an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 disables the set middleware API by default, and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 18:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9714 | Stack overflow in libxml2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9714</link><description>Uncontrolled recursion in XPath evaluation in libxml2 up to and including version 2.9.14 allows a local attacker to cause a stack overflow via crafted expressions.

This vulnerability exists because management interface ACLs have not been supported on Cisco IOS XR Software Packet I/O infrastructure platforms for Linux-handled features such as SSH, NetConf, or gRPC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ingress ACL that is applied on the management interface of the affected device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20248 | Cisco IOS XR Software Image Verification Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20248</link><description>A vulnerability in the installation process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass Cisco IOS XR Software image signature verification and load unsigned software on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system privileges on the affected device.

This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of files during the installation of an .iso file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying contents of the .iso image and then installing and activating it on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load an unsigned file as part of the image activation process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20340 | Cisco IOS XR Address Resolution Protocol Broadcast Storm Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20340</link><description>A vulnerability in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a broadcast storm, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&amp;nbsp;

This vulnerability is due to how Cisco IOS XR Software processes a high, sustained rate of ARP traffic hitting the management interface. Under certain conditions, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an excessive amount of traffic to the management interface of an affected device, overwhelming its ARP processing capabilities. A successful exploit could result in degraded device performance, loss of management connectivity, and complete unresponsiveness of the system, leading to a DoS condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43886 | Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, Hyper-V contain(s) a Path Traversal: '.../...//' vulnerability.

Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand` function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests recurring events in their expanded form using the `` element, the server stores all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible, implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43725 | Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerabi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43725</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability.
