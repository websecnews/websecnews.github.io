In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:45:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32969 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rest-server allows SQL injection in query endpoint of REST API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32969</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform.

Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:44:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29743 | D-Link DIR-816 A2V1.1.0B05 was found to contain a command injection in /goform/delRouting.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29743</link><description>D-Link DIR-816 A2V1.1.0B05 was found to contain a command injection in /goform/delRouting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:27:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26159 | Laravel Starter 11.11.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the tags feature.

This issue has been patched in version 1.11.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 17:29:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32950 | io.jmix.localfs:jmix-localfs has a Path Traversal in Local File Storage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32950</link><description>Jmix is a set of libraries and tools to speed up Spring Boot data-centric application development. In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, attackers could manipulate the FileRef parameter to access files on the system where the Jmix application is deployed, provided the application server has the necessary permissions. This can be accomplished either by modifying the FileRef directly in the database or by supplying a harmful value in the fileRef parameter of the `/files` endpoint of the generic REST API. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 17:29:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32963 | Minio Operator uses Kubernetes apiserver audience for AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity STS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32963</link><description>MinIO Operator STS is a native IAM Authentication for Kubernetes.

Prior to commit 00bebea, when enabling a conflicting extension, a restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right. This issue has been patched in commit 00bebea. A workaround involves ensuring that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 17:29:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29339 | An issue in UPF in Open5GS UPF versions up to v2.7.2 results an assertion failure vulnerability in PFCP session parameter validation.

The file upload functionality can be enabled or disabled for specific use cases through configuration.

During the upload file, interception and allowed file type rules are still applied correctly.

If file sharing is generally enabled, this issue is not of concern.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:56:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3519 | Replace uploaded files knowing the file upload ID</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3519</link><description>An authorization bypass in Unblu Spark allows a participant of a conversation to replace an existing, uploaded file.
