This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of packets that are punted to the route processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic, which must be handled by the Linux stack on the route processor, to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane traffic to stop working, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20142 | Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Routers L2VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20142</link><description>A vulnerability in the IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature and quality of service (QoS) policy feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed IPv4 packets that are received on line cards where the interface has either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause network processor errors, resulting in a reset or shutdown of the network process. Traffic over that line card would be lost while the line card reloads.
Note: This vulnerability has predominantly been observed in Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) environments where an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy has been applied to the bridge virtual interface. Layer 3 configurations where the interface has either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied are also affected, though the vulnerability has not been observed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20143 | Cisco IOS XR Software Secure Boot Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20143</link><description>A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with high privileges to bypass the Secure Boot functionality and load unverified software on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system privileges on the affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of modules in the software load process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the loaded binaries to bypass some of the integrity checks that are performed during the booting process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to control the boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass the requirement to run Cisco-signed images or alter the security properties of the running system.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.2, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.5, from 3.10.0 before 3.22.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.

If you have Camel applications that are directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include parameters in the HTTP requests that are sent to the Camel application that incorrectly get translated into headers. 

The headers could be both provided as request parameters for an HTTP methods invocation or as part of the payload of the HTTP methods invocation.

All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

This CVE is related to the CVE-2025-27636: while they have the same root cause and are fixed with the same fix, CVE-2025-27636 was assumed to only be exploitable if an attacker could add malicious HTTP headers, while we have now determined that it is also exploitable via HTTP parameters. Like in CVE-2025-27636, exploitation is only possible if the Camel route uses particular vulnerable components.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:52:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27915 | An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0 and 10.1.

A session hijacking vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.8.10 when an attacker-controlled authoritative subdomain under a parent domain (e.g., `subdomain.host.com`) sets cookies scoped to the parent domain (`.host.com`). This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens aren't rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List. Due to non-existent session token rotation after authenticating we can theoretically reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browser's security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described. Version 1.8.10 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:13:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27788 | Ruby JSON Parser has Out-of-bounds Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27788</link><description>JSON is a JSON implementation for Ruby.

bpf: Fix deadlock when freeing cgroup storage

The following commit
bc235cdb423a ("bpf: Prevent deadlock from recursive bpf_task_storage_[get|delete]")
first introduced deadlock prevention for fentry/fexit programs attaching
on bpf_task_storage helpers. That commit also employed the logic in map
free path in its v6 version.

Later bpf_cgrp_storage was first introduced in
c4bcfb38a95e ("bpf: Implement cgroup storage available to non-cgroup-attached bpf progs")
which faces the same issue as bpf_task_storage, instead of its busy
counter, NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened
a window to cause deadlock:

Progs:

   - cgid (BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH)
	Record the id of the cgroup the current task belonging
	to in this hash map, using the address of the cgroup
	as the map key.
   - cgrpa (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	If current task is a kworker, lookup the above hash
	map using function parameter @owner as the key to get
	its corresponding cgroup id which is then used to get
	a trusted pointer to the cgroup through
	bpf_cgroup_from_id(). This trusted pointer can then
	be passed to bpf_cgrp_storage_get() to finally trigger
	the deadlock issue.
 - B: SEC("tp_btf/sys_enter")
   - cgrpb (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	The only purpose of this prog is to fill Prog A's
	hash map by calling bpf_cgrp_storage_get() for as
	many userspace tasks as possible.

Steps to reproduce:
 - Run A;
 - while (true) { Run B; Destroy B; }

Fix this issue by passing its busy counter to the free procedure so
it can be properly incremented before storage/smap locking.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58089 | btrfs: fix double accounting race when btrfs_run_delalloc_range() failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58089</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acct: perform last write from workqueue

In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used to
trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that
triggers an internal lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)
to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file
happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A
lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current-&gt;fs.

Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the
workqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the
(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.

This api should stop to exist though.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:51:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21847 | ASoC: SOF: stream-ipc: Check for cstream nullity in sof_ipc_msg_data()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21847</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Try to remedy the problem by saving irq state before spin lock

bpf: Fix softlockup in arena_map_free on 64k page kernel

On an aarch64 kernel with CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_64KB=y,
arena_htab tests cause a segmentation fault and soft lockup.
The same failure is not observed with 4k pages on aarch64.

It turns out arena_map_free() is calling
apply_to_existing_page_range() with the address returned by
bpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start().  If this address is not page-aligned
the code ends up calling apply_to_pte_range() with that unaligned
address causing soft lockup.

Fix it by round up GUARD_SZ to PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; 1 so that the
division by 2 in bpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start() returns
a page-aligned value.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:51:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21852 | net: Add rx_skb of kfree_skb to raw_tp_null_args[].</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21852</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Add rx_skb of kfree_skb to raw_tp_null_args[].

Yan Zhai reported a BPF prog could trigger a null-ptr-deref [0]
in trace_kfree_skb if the prog does not check if rx_sk is NULL.

Commit c53795d48ee8 ("net: add rx_sk to trace_kfree_skb") added
rx_sk to trace_kfree_skb, but rx_sk is optional and could be NULL.

Let's add kfree_skb to raw_tp_null_args[] to let the BPF verifier
validate such a prog and prevent the issue.

Now we fail to load such a prog:

bpf: avoid holding freeze_mutex during mmap operation

We use map-&gt;freeze_mutex to prevent races between map_freeze() and
memory mapping BPF map contents with writable permissions. The way we
naively do this means we'll hold freeze_mutex for entire duration of all
the mm and VMA manipulations, which is completely unnecessary. This can
potentially also lead to deadlocks, as reported by syzbot in [0].

So, instead, hold freeze_mutex only during writeability checks, bump
(proactively) "write active" count for the map, unlock the mutex and
proceed with mmap logic. And only if something went wrong during mmap
logic, then undo that "write active" counter increment.

sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected

sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
sockmap, which blows up quickly:

a device without a release function is a broken device

The current code directly frees the device after calling device_add()

Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device,
e.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free

geneve: Fix use-after-free in geneve_find_dev().

syzkaller reported a use-after-free in geneve_find_dev() [0]
without repro.

geneve_configure() links struct geneve_dev.next to
net_generic(net, geneve_net_id)-&gt;geneve_list.

The net here could differ from dev_net(dev) if IFLA_NET_NS_PID,
IFLA_NET_NS_FD, or IFLA_TARGET_NETNSID is set.

When dev_net(dev) is dismantled, geneve_exit_batch_rtnl() finally
calls unregister_netdevice_queue() for each dev in the netns,
and later the dev is freed.

However, its geneve_dev.next is still linked to the backend UDP
socket netns.

Then, use-after-free will occur when another geneve dev is created
in the netns.

Let's call geneve_dellink() instead in geneve_destroy_tunnels().

mm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails

Commit b7c0ccdfbafd ("mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()")
skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the
entire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap
entries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries
that were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become
inconsistent.

This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:
  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap
  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng
  $ sudo reboot

  The two warnings are:
    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():
      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes &amp; (PAGE_SIZE - 1));

    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():
      if (WARN_ONCE(new &lt; 0, "page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\n",
	  new, nr_pages))

zswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.

As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap
entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,
zswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries
when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and
incrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and
leave the optimization for later after some evaluation.

After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.

add the folio to be freed to the LRU, making memcg code unhappy.  Running

Likely, nothing else goes wrong: putting the last folio reference will
remove the folio from the LRU again.  So besides memcg complaining, adding
the folio to be freed to the LRU is just an unnecessary step.

The new flow resembles what we have in migrate_folio_move(): add the dst
to the lru, rem

If drop_monitor is built as a kernel module, syzkaller may have time
to send a netlink NET_DM_CMD_START message during the module loading.
This will call the net_dm_monitor_start() function that uses
a spinlock that has not yet been initialized.

To fix this, let's place resource initialization above the registration
of a generic netlink family.

tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we currently drop dst

Xiumei reported hitting the WARN in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit while
running tests that boil down to:
 - create a pair of netns
 - run a basic TCP test over ipcomp6
 - delete the pair of netns

The xfrm_state found on spi_byaddr was not deleted at the time we
delete the netns, because we still have a reference on it. This
lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the
xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not
leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by
skb_attempt_defer_free.

The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's
defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In
that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't
expect at this point.

We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no
longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point,
tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the
secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those
places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we
cannot simply drop all extensions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:51:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21865 | gtp: Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gtp: Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl().

Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in
gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0]

Commit eb28fd76c0a0 ("gtp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns
dismantle.") added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl()
to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels.

However, this could trigger -&gt;dellink() twice for the same device during
-&gt;exit_batch_rtnl().

Say we have two netns A &amp; B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but
whose UDP socket is in netns A.

  1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B.

  2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns A's gn-&gt;gtp_dev_list and calls -&gt;dellink().

  [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B
    as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ]

  3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns B's for_each_netdev() and calls -&gt;dellink().

gtp_dellink() cleans up the device's hash table, unlinks the dev from
gn-&gt;gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue().

Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled.

Let's remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and
delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done
in bareudp.

  ==================================================================

f8 corresponds to KASAN_VMALLOC_INVALID which means the area is not
initialised hence not supposed to be used yet.

Powerpc text patching infrastructure allocates a virtual memory area
using get_vm_area() and flags it as VM_ALLOC. But that flag is meant
to be used for vmalloc() and vmalloc() allocated memory is not
supposed to be used before a call to __vmalloc_node_range() which is
never called for that area.

That went undetected until commit e4137f08816b ("mm, kasan, kmsan:
instrument copy_from/to_kernel_nofault")

The area allocated by text_area_cpu_up() is not vmalloc memory, it is
mapped directly on demand when needed by map_kernel_page(). There is
no VM flag corresponding to such usage, so just pass no flag. That way
the area will be unpoisonned and usable immediately.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:51:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13446 | Workreap &amp;lt;= 3.2.5 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13446</link><description>The Workreap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5.

When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:25:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27773 | SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 library has incorrect signature verification for HTTP-Redirect binding</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27773</link><description>The SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 library is a PHP library for SAML2 related functionality.

tokens to non-Azure container registries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27403</link><description>Ratify is a verification engine as a binary executable and on Kubernetes which enables verification of artifact security metadata and admits for deployment only those that comply with policies the user creates. In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12546 | Potential iSCSI R2T PDU Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12546</link><description>EDK2 contains a vulnerability in BIOS where a user may cause an Integer Overflow or Wraparound by network means.
