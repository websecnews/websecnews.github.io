When decoding PCM, the libmpg123 may write past the end of a heap-located buffer. Consequently, heap corruption may happen, and arbitrary code execution is not discarded. The complexity required to exploit this flaw is considered high as the payload must be validated by the MPEG decoder and the PCM synth before execution. Additionally, to successfully execute the attack, the user must scan through the stream, making web live stream content (such as web radios) a very unlikely attack vector.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 18:40:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50801 | A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in AbanteCart 1.4.0 in the update() function in public_html/admin/controller/responses/listing_...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50801</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in AbanteCart 1.4.0 in the update() function in public_html/admin/controller/responses/listing_grid/collections.php.

Prior to 1.4.0, there is an issue where verification signatures for requests sent to Reverb's Pusher-compatible API were not being verified. This API is used in scenarios such as broadcasting a message from a backend service or for obtaining statistical information (such as number of connections) about a given channel. This issue only affects the Pusher-compatible API endpoints and not the WebSocket connections themselves. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the application ID which, should never be exposed, would need to be known by an attacker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 18:16:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7883 | CMSE secure state may leak from stack to floating-point registers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7883</link><description>When using Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), Secure stack 
contents can be leaked to Non-secure state via floating-point registers 
when a Secure to Non-secure function call is made that returns a 
floating-point value and when this is the first use of floating-point 
since entering Secure state. This allows an attacker to read a limited 
quantity of Secure stack contents with an impact on confidentiality. 
This issue is specific to code generated using LLVM-based compilers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:10:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51430 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in online diagnostic lab management system using php v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51430</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in online diagnostic lab management system using php v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the Test Name parameter on the diagnostic/add-test.php component.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:40:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51478 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in YesWiki</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51478</link><description>YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP.

On macOS, built-in builders (such as `builtin:fetchurl`, exposed to users with `import &lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;`) were not executed in the macOS sandbox. Thus, these builders (which are running under the `nixbld*` users) had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. This issue is fixed in 2.18.9, 2.19.7, 2.20.9, 2.21.5, 2.22.4, 2.23.4, and 2.24.10. Note that sandboxing is not enabled by default on macOS. The Nix sandbox is not primarily intended as a security mechanism, but as an aid to improve reproducibility and purity of Nix builds. However, sandboxing *can* mitigate the impact of other security issues by limiting what parts of the host system a build has access to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:40:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50354 | Out-of-memory during deserialization with crafted inputs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50354</link><description>gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits.

This issue affects Apache Lucene.NET's Replicator library: from 4.8.0-beta00005 through 4.8.0-beta00016.

An attacker that can intercept traffic between a replication client and server, or control the target replication node URL, can provide a specially-crafted JSON response that is deserialized as an attacker-provided exception type. This can result in remote code execution or other potential unauthorized access.
