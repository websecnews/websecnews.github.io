So what I just did is :
- First removed the cors configuration that allows everyone to access it :
before:
```python
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins="*", ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for every one
```
after:
```python
    cert_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"cert.pem"
    key_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"key.pem"
    if os.path.exists(cert_file_path) and os.path.exists(key_file_path):
        is_https = True
    else:
        is_https = False        

    # Create a Socket.IO server
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins=config.allowed_origins+[f"https://localhost:{config['port']}" if is_https else f"http://localhost:{config['port']}"], ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for selected origins
```

- Second, I have updated lollms to have two modes (a headless mode and a ui mode).
And updated the /execute_code to block if the server is headless or is exposed
```python
@router.post("/execute_code")
async def execute_code(request: Request):
    """
    Executes Python code and returns the output.

    :param request: The HTTP request object.
    :return: A JSON response with the status of the operation.
    """
    if lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode:
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when in headless mode for obvious security reasons!"}

    if lollmsElfServer.config.host=="0.0.0.0":
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when the server is exposed outside for very obvipous reasons!"}

    try:
        data = (await request.json())
        code = data["code"]
        discussion_id = int(data.get("discussion_id","unknown_discussion"))
        message_id = int(data.get("message_id","unknown_message"))
        language = data.get("language","python")
        


        if language=="python":
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing python code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_python(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        if language=="javascript":

            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_mermaid(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        elif language in ["graphviz","dot"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing graphviz code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_graphviz(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        return {"status": False, "error": "Unsupported language", "execution_time": 0}
    except Exception as ex:
        trace_exception(ex)
        lollmsElfServer.error(ex)
        return {"status":False,"error":str(ex)}
```

I also added an optional https mode and looking forward to add a full authentication with cookies and a personal session etc.


All updates will be in V 9.1

All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically,  it's possible to crash the repo server component through an out of memory error by pointing it to a malicious Helm registry. The loadRepoIndex() function in the ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data. It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating memory until it runs out of it. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in v2.10.3, v2.9.8, and v2.8.12.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 15:15:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29890 | Remote code execution in datalens-ui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29890</link><description>DataLens is a business intelligence and data visualization system.

sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
switch_drv_remove()              |
 flush_work()                    |
  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                 |   schedule_work(&amp;psw-&gt;work)
 timer_shutdown_sync()           |
 ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
 kfree(psw) // free              |
                                 |   psw-&gt;state = 0 // use

This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
stopped safely before the deallocate operations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 09:22:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2409 | The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1.
