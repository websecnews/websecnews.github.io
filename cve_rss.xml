OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; third, those contextual tuples’s user field is an userset; and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 22:33:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47181 | Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Update Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47181</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 22:11:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4975 | Tapo privilege escalation on shared devices using notifications</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4975</link><description>When a notification relating to low battery appears for a user with whom the device has been shared, tapping the notification grants full access to the power settings of that device.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 21:31:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48374 | zot logs secrets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48374</link><description>zot is ancontainer image/artifact registry based on the Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification.

The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (1000–9999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 20:44:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48373 | Schule Has Client-Side Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48373</link><description>Schule is open-source school management system software. The application relies on client-side JavaScript (index.js) to redirect users to different panels based on their role. Prior to version 1.0.1, this implementation poses a serious security risk because it assumes that the value of data.role is trustworthy on the client side. Attackers can manipulate JavaScript in the browser (e.g., via browser dev tools or intercepting API responses) and set data.role to any arbitrary value (e.g., "admin"), gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas of the application.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 20:44:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5962 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Authentication Endpoint of Multiple WSO2 Products Due to Missing Output Encoding</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5962</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the authentication endpoint of multiple WSO2 products due to missing output encoding of user-supplied input. A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the authentication flow, potentially leading to UI modifications, redirections to malicious websites, or data exfiltration from the browser.

A bug fix caused a regression causing an issue with function to delete local data. Instructing the client to delete its local database on user logout does not result in deletion. This is the case for both temporary clients (marking the device as a public computer on login) and regular clients instructing the deletion of all personal information and conversations upon logout. Access to the machine is required to access the data. If encryption-at-rest is used, cryptographic material can't be exported. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-14-production.0. In order to mitigate potential impact, the database must be manually deleted on devices where the option "This is a public computer" was used prior to log in or a log out with the request to delete local data with the affected versions has happened before.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 17:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48075 | Fiber panics when fiber.Ctx.BodyParser parses invalid range index</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48075</link><description>Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go.

a trusted use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.

Impact summary: If a user intends to make a trusted certificate rejected for
a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for that use.

A copy &amp; paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this
issue in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If, for example, a trusted CA certificate
should be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not
for CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intended
to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CA
certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.

Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509
command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue.
The issues affecting only the command line application are considered to
be Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue.

OpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by this
issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 13:40:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4979 | Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4979</link><description>An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 17.10.7, 17.11 before 17.11.3, and 18.0 before 18.0.1.

Prior to commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba, edxapp has no built-in protection against downloading the python_lib.zip asset from courses, which is a concern since it often contains custom grading code or answers to course problems. This potentially affects any course using custom Python-graded problem blocks. The openedx/configuration repo has had a patch since 2016 in the form of an nginx rule, but this was only intended as a temporary mitigation. As the configuration repo has been deprecated and we have not been able to locate any similar protection in Tutor, it is likely that most deployments have no protection against python_lib.zip being downloaded. The recommended mitigation, implemented in commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba, restricts python_lib.zip downloads to just the course team and site staff/superusers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:28:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5052 | FreeFloat FTP Server LS Command buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5052</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0.

Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48063 | XWiki Platform Security Authorization Bridge allows users with just edit right can enforce required rights with programming right</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48063</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4 and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48064 | GitHub Desktop vulnerable to maliciously crafted file renames leading to information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48064</link><description>GitHub Desktop is an open-source, Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. Prior to version 3.4.20-beta3, an attacker convincing a user to view a file in a commit of their making in the history view can cause information disclosure by means of Git attempting to access a network share. This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash. GitHub Desktop 3.4.20 and later fix this vulnerability. The beta channel includes the fix in 3.4.20-beta3. As a workaround to use until upgrading is possible, only browse commits in the history view that comes from trusted sources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46822 | Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via Absolute Path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46822</link><description>OsamaTaher/Java-springboot-codebase is a collection of Java and Spring Boot code snippets, applications, and projects.

If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:34:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1712 | Arbitrary file write with vcrtrace</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1712</link><description>Argument injection in special agent configuration in Checkmk &lt;2.4.0p1, &lt;2.3.0p32, &lt;2.2.0p42 and 2.1.0 allows authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:13:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-16536 | Stack overflow leading to DoS can be triggered by a malicious authenticated client.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-16536</link><description>Stack overflow leading to DoS can be triggered by a malicious authenticated client in Clickhouse before 19.14.3.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:31:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-25255 | Yandex Browser Lite for Android prior to version 21.1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25255</link><description>Yandex Browser Lite for Android prior to version 21.1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:15:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-25262 | Yandex Browser for Android prior to version 21.3.0 allows remote attackers to perform IDN homograph attack.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25262</link><description>Yandex Browser for Android prior to version 21.3.0 allows remote attackers to perform IDN homograph attack.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:15:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-25254 | Yandex Browser Lite for Android before 21.1.0 allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25254</link><description>Yandex Browser Lite for Android before 21.1.0 allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:15:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4949 | XXE vulnerability in Eclipse JGit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4949</link><description>In Eclipse JGit versions 7.2.0.202503040940-r and older, the ManifestParser class used by the repo command and the AmazonS3 class used to implement the experimental amazons3 git transport protocol allowing to store git pack files in an Amazon S3 bucket, are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks when parsing XML files.
