PCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDL

The suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDL
platform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):

  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf

This patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resume
sequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications to
critical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets the
same problem as the following downstream commit:

  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995

Unlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe
device if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k
or iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the
driver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with
existing practices.

Upon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an
example of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:

  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible
  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944

Without this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a
PCIe device is connected.

s390/entry: Mark IRQ entries to fix stack depot warnings

The stack depot filters out everything outside of the top interrupt
context as an uninteresting or irrelevant part of the stack traces. This
helps with stack trace de-duplication, avoiding an explosion of saved
stack traces that share the same IRQ context code path but originate
from different randomly interrupted points, eventually exhausting the
stack depot.

Filtering uses in_irqentry_text() to identify functions within the
.irqentry.text and .softirqentry.text sections, which then become the
last stack trace entries being saved.

While __do_softirq() is placed into the .softirqentry.text section by
common code, populating .irqentry.text is architecture-specific.

Currently, the .irqentry.text section on s390 is empty, which prevents
stack depot filtering and de-duplication and could result in warnings
like:

Stack depot reached limit capacity
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 286113 at lib/stackdepot.c:252 depot_alloc_stack+0x39a/0x3c8

with PREEMPT and KASAN enabled.

Fix this by moving the IO/EXT interrupt handlers from .kprobes.text into
the .irqentry.text section and updating the kprobes blacklist to include
the .irqentry.text section.

This is done only for asynchronous interrupts and explicitly not for
program checks, which are synchronous and where the context beyond the
program check is important to preserve. Despite machine checks being
somewhat in between, they are extremely rare, and preserving context
when possible is also of value.

SVCs and Restart Interrupts are not relevant, one being always at the
boundary to user space and the other being a one-time thing.

IRQ entries filtering is also optionally used in ftrace function graph,
where the same logic applies.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 14:27:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41149 | block: avoid to reuse `hctx` not removed from cpuhp callback list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41149</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: don't access invalid sched

Since 2320c9e6a768 ("drm/sched: memset() 'job' in drm_sched_job_init()")
accessing job-&gt;base.sched can produce unexpected results as the initialisation
of (*job)-&gt;base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by the
memset.

This commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and would
be rejected after job-&gt;num_ibs is incremented. In this case,
amdgpu_ib_free(ring-&gt;adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the
machine because the ring value is bogus.

To fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free(): we can do this
because the device is actually not used in this function.

The next commit will remove the ring argument completely.

acquire -&gt;sysfs_lock before freezing the queue. This incorrect ordering

nilfs2: prevent use of deleted inode

syzbot reported a WARNING in nilfs_rmdir. [1]

Because the inode bitmap is corrupted, an inode with an inode number that
should exist as a ".nilfs" file was reassigned by nilfs_mkdir for "file0",
causing an inode duplication during execution.  And this causes an
underflow of i_nlink in rmdir operations.

The inode is used twice by the same task to unmount and remove directories
".nilfs" and "file0", it trigger warning in nilfs_rmdir.

Avoid to this issue, check i_nlink in nilfs_iget(), if it is 0, it means
that this inode has been deleted, and iput is executed to reclaim it.

smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod

Commit ef7134c7fc48 ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.")
fixed a netns UAF by manually enabled socket refcounting
(sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt=1 and sock_inuse_add(net, 1)).

The reason the patch worked for that bug was because we now hold
references to the netns (get_net_track() gets a ref internally)
and they're properly released (internally, on __sk_destruct()),
but only because sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt was set.

Problem:
(this happens regardless of CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER and regardless
if init_net or other)

Setting sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt=1 *manually* and *after* socket creation is not
only out of cifs scope, but also technically wrong -- it's set conditionally
based on user (=1) vs kernel (=0) sockets.  And net/ implementations
seem to base their user vs kernel space operations on it.

e.g. upon TCP socket close, the TCP timers are not cleared because
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt=1:
(cf. commit 151c9c724d05 ("tcp: properly terminate timers for kernel sockets"))

net/ipv4/tcp.c:
    void tcp_close(struct sock *sk, long timeout)
    {
    	lock_sock(sk);
    	__tcp_close(sk, timeout);
    	release_sock(sk);
    	if (!sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt)
    		inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync(sk);
    	sock_put(sk);
    }

Which will throw a lockdep warning and then, as expected, deadlock on
tcp_write_timer().

A way to reproduce this is by running the reproducer from ef7134c7fc48
and then 'rmmod cifs'.  A few seconds later, the deadlock/lockdep
warning shows up.

Fix:
We shouldn't mess with socket internals ourselves, so do not set
sk_net_refcnt manually.

Also change __sock_create() to sock_create_kern() for explicitness.

As for non-init_net network namespaces, we deal with it the best way
we can -- hold an extra netns reference for server-&gt;ssocket and drop it
when it's released.  This ensures that the netns still exists whenever
we need to create/destroy server-&gt;ssocket, but is not directly tied to
it.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54683 | netfilter: IDLETIMER: Fix for possible ABBA deadlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Debugging a filesystem patch with generic/475 caused the system to hang
after observing the following sequences in dmesg:

 XFS (dm-0): metadata I/O error in "xfs_imap_to_bp+0x61/0xe0 [xfs]" at daddr 0x491520 len 32 error 5

The system is stuck in unmount trying to lock a couple of inodes so that
they can be purged.  The dquot corruption notice above is a clue to what
happened -- a link() call tried to set up a transaction to link a child
into a directory.  Quota reservation for the transaction failed after IO
errors shut down the filesystem, but then we forgot to unlock the inodes
on our way out.  Fix that.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55642 | block: Prevent potential deadlocks in zone write plug error recovery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55642</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Prevent potential deadlocks in zone write plug error recovery

Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block
device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone
fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write
pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write
pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can
always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write
BIOs.

However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a
device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone
write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the
disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a
report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the
underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But
with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will
block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the
processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage
reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a
deadlock.

Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging
code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation,
instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones,
reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which
is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only
after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all
well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report
zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the
current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption
about the position is.

The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows:
 - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated
   resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk
   zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions
   disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error().

 - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write
   plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write
   plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is
   not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone,
   reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed.

 - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed
   write BIO.

 - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this
   new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer
   offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations.

 - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb()
   callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for
   any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag.
   This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone
   write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within
   the range of the report zones operation executed by the user.

 - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call
   disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required
   zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving
   any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write
   plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55881 | KVM: x86: Play nice with protected guests in complete_hypercall_exit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55881</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: hv: util: Avoid accessing a ringbuffer not initialized yet

If the KVP (or VSS) daemon starts before the VMBus channel's ringbuffer is
fully initialized, we can hit the panic below:

hv_utils: Registering HyperV Utility Driver
hv_vmbus: registering driver hv_utils
...
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
CPU: 44 UID: 0 PID: 2552 Comm: hv_kvp_daemon Tainted: G E 6.11.0-rc3+ #1

 kvp_register_done
 hvt_op_read
 vfs_read
 ksys_read
 __x64_sys_read

This can happen because the KVP/VSS channel callback can be invoked
even before the channel is fully opened:
1) as soon as hv_kvp_init() -&gt; hvutil_transport_init() creates
/dev/vmbus/hv_kvp, the kvp daemon can open the device file immediately and
register itself to the driver by writing a message KVP_OP_REGISTER1 to the
file (which is handled by kvp_on_msg() -&gt;kvp_handle_handshake()) and
reading the file for the driver's response, which is handled by
hvt_op_read(), which calls hvt-&gt;on_read(), i.e. kvp_register_done().

2) the problem with kvp_register_done() is that it can cause the
channel callback to be called even before the channel is fully opened,
and when the channel callback is starting to run, util_probe()-&gt;
vmbus_open() may have not initialized the ringbuffer yet, so the
callback can hit the panic of NULL pointer dereference.

To reproduce the panic consistently, we can add a "ssleep(10)" for KVP in
__vmbus_open(), just before the first hv_ringbuffer_init(), and then we
unload and reload the driver hv_utils, and run the daemon manually within
the 10 seconds.

Fix the panic by reordering the steps in util_probe() so the char dev
entry used by the KVP or VSS daemon is not created until after
vmbus_open() has completed. This reordering prevents the race condition
from happening.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56368 | ring-buffer: Fix overflow in __rb_map_vma</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56368</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: oa_tc6: fix tx skb race condition between reference pointers

There are two skb pointers to manage tx skb's enqueued from n/w stack.
waiting_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which needs to be processed
and ongoing_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which is being processed.

SPI thread prepares the tx data chunks from the tx skb pointed by the
ongoing_tx_skb pointer. When the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb is
processed, the tx skb pointed by the waiting_tx_skb is assigned to
ongoing_tx_skb and the waiting_tx_skb pointer is assigned with NULL.
Whenever there is a new tx skb from n/w stack, it will be assigned to
waiting_tx_skb pointer if it is NULL. Enqueuing and processing of a tx skb
handled in two different threads.

Consider a scenario where the SPI thread processed an ongoing_tx_skb and
it moves next tx skb from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer
without doing any NULL check. At this time, if the waiting_tx_skb pointer
is NULL then ongoing_tx_skb pointer is also assigned with NULL. After
that, if a new tx skb is assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer by the n/w
stack and there is a chance to overwrite the tx skb pointer with NULL in
the SPI thread. Finally one of the tx skb will be left as unhandled,
resulting packet missing and memory leak.

- Consider the below scenario where the TXC reported from the previous
transfer is 10 and ongoing_tx_skb holds an tx ethernet frame which can be
transported in 20 TXCs and waiting_tx_skb is still NULL.
	tx_credits = 10; /* 21 are filled in the previous transfer */
	ongoing_tx_skb = 20;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */
- So, (tc6-&gt;ongoing_tx_skb || tc6-&gt;waiting_tx_skb) becomes true.
- After oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()
	ongoing_tx_skb = 10;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */
- Perform SPI transfer.
- Process SPI rx buffer to get the TXC from footers.
- Now let's assume previously filled 21 TXCs are freed so we are good to
transport the next remaining 10 tx chunks from ongoing_tx_skb.
	tx_credits = 21;
	ongoing_tx_skb = 10;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL;
- So, (tc6-&gt;ongoing_tx_skb || tc6-&gt;waiting_tx_skb) becomes true again.
- In the oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()
	ongoing_tx_skb = NULL;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL;

- Now the below bad case might happen,

Thread1 (oa_tc6_start_xmit)	Thread2 (oa_tc6_spi_thread_handler)
---------------------------	-----------------------------------
- if waiting_tx_skb is NULL
				- if ongoing_tx_skb is NULL
				- ongoing_tx_skb = waiting_tx_skb
- waiting_tx_skb = skb
				- waiting_tx_skb = NULL
				...
				- ongoing_tx_skb = NULL
- if waiting_tx_skb is NULL
- waiting_tx_skb = skb

To overcome the above issue, protect the moving of tx skb reference from
waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer and assigning new tx skb
to waiting_tx_skb pointer, so that the other thread can't access the
waiting_tx_skb pointer until the current thread completes moving the tx
skb reference safely.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57791 | net/smc: check return value of sock_recvmsg when draining clc data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57791</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virt: tdx-guest: Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errors

In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned

to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional

drm/dp_mst: Ensure mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()

While receiving an MST up request message from one thread in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), the MST topology could be removed from
another thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), freeing
mst_primary and setting drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::mst_primary to NULL.
This could lead to a NULL deref/use-after-free of mst_primary in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req().

Avoid the above by holding a reference for mst_primary in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() while it's used.

  root@q:linux# cat repro.sh
  set -e

  mkfs.btrfs -q -f /dev/sdb
  mount /dev/sdb /mnt/btrfs
  btrfs quota enable -s /mnt/btrfs
  umount /mnt/btrfs
  mount /dev/sdb /mnt/btrfs

The issue is that when enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(), we set
BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_SIMPLE_MODE at fs_info-&gt;qgroup_flags and persist
it in the quota root in the item with the key BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_KEY, but
we only set the incompat bit BTRFS_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_SIMPLE_QUOTA after we
commit the transaction used to enable simple quotas.

This means that if after that transaction commit we unmount the filesystem
without starting and committing any other transaction, or we have a power
failure, the next time we mount the filesystem we will find the flag
BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_SIMPLE_MODE set in the item with the key
BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_KEY but we will not find the incompat bit
BTRFS_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_SIMPLE_QUOTA set in the superblock, triggering an
assertion failure at:

  btrfs_read_qgroup_config() -&gt; qgroup_read_enable_gen()

To fix this issue, set the BTRFS_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_SIMPLE_QUOTA flag
immediately after setting the BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_SIMPLE_MODE.
This ensures that both flags are flushed to disk within the same
transaction.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57807 | scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix for a potential deadlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57807</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that included
a WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.

Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in the
task affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; we
have a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN
set up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with
the requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its
trivial to create this condition.

Reproduced the warning by the following setup:

- $PID inside a cpuset cgroup
- another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1
- another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41935 | f2fs: fix to shrink read extent node in batches</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41935</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace

There is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a
combination of tail calls and freplace.

In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of
tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in
entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:

entry_tc -&gt; subprog_tc -&gt; entry_freplace --tailcall-&gt; entry_tc.

The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to
zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism
to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.

To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:

1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a
   prog_array map.
2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map
   with an freplace program.

This ensures that:

* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,
  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.
* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its
  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.

Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return
-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a
prog_array map.

Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a
tab for proper formatting.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47809 | dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47809</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference

This patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function is
called from request_lock() as lkb-&gt;lkb_resource is not assigned yet,
only after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb(). Another issue
is that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot
assume to be ASCII coded.

The log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used in
normal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereference
can only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource
assigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we
should be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we
actually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.

In this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id
is enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this
exists.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48873 | wifi: rtw89: check return value of ieee80211_probereq_get() for RNR</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48873</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

stackdepot: fix stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI context

Per documentation, stack_depot_save_flags() was meant to be usable from
NMI context if STACK_DEPOT_FLAG_CAN_ALLOC is unset.  However, it still
would try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in the
current pool (if space is available).

This could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock is
already held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI context
and give up if unsuccessful.

The documentation is fixed to clearly convey this.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48881 | bcache: revert replacing IS_ERR_OR_NULL with IS_ERR again</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48881</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcache: revert replacing IS_ERR_OR_NULL with IS_ERR again

Commit 028ddcac477b ("bcache: Remove unnecessary NULL point check in
node allocations") leads a NULL pointer deference in cache_set_flush().

1721         if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(c-&gt;root))
1722                 list_add(&amp;amp;c-&gt;root-&gt;list, &amp;amp;c-&gt;btree_cache);

&gt;From the above code in cache_set_flush(), if previous registration code
fails before allocating c-&gt;root, it is possible c-&gt;root is NULL as what
it is initialized. __bch_btree_node_alloc() never returns NULL but
c-&gt;root is possible to be NULL at above line 1721.

This patch replaces IS_ERR() by IS_ERR_OR_NULL() to fix this.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49569 | nvme-rdma: unquiesce admin_q before destroy it</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49569</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvs: fix UB due to uninitialized stack access in ip_vs_protocol_init()

Under certain kernel configurations when building with Clang/LLVM, the
compiler does not generate a return or jump as the terminator
instruction for ip_vs_protocol_init(), triggering the following objtool
warning during build time:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: ip_vs_protocol_init() falls through to next function __initstub__kmod_ip_vs_rr__935_123_ip_vs_rr_init6()

At runtime, this either causes an oops when trying to load the ipvs
module or a boot-time panic if ipvs is built-in. This same issue has
been reported by the Intel kernel test robot previously.

Digging deeper into both LLVM and the kernel code reveals this to be a
undefined behavior problem. ip_vs_protocol_init() uses a on-stack buffer
of 64 chars to store the registered protocol names and leaves it
uninitialized after definition. The function calls strnlen() when
concatenating protocol names into the buffer. With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE
strnlen() performs an extra step to check whether the last byte of the
input char buffer is a null character (commit 3009f891bb9f ("fortify:
Allow strlen() and strnlen() to pass compile-time known lengths")).
This, together with possibly other configurations, cause the following
IR to be generated:

  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #5 section ".init.text" align 16 !kcfi_type !29 {
    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16
    ...

  14:                                               ; preds = %11
    %15 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63
    %16 = load i8, ptr %15, align 1
    %17 = tail call i1 @llvm.is.constant.i8(i8 %16)
    %18 = icmp eq i8 %16, 0
    %19 = select i1 %17, i1 %18, i1 false
    br i1 %19, label %20, label %23

  20:                                               ; preds = %14
    %21 = call i64 @strlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1) #23
    ...

  23:                                               ; preds = %14, %11, %20
    %24 = call i64 @strnlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1, i64 noundef 64) #24
    ...
  }

The above code calculates the address of the last char in the buffer
(value %15) and then loads from it (value %16). Because the buffer is
never initialized, the LLVM GVN pass marks value %16 as undefined:

  %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63
  br i1 undef, label %14, label %17

This gives later passes (SCCP, in particular) more DCE opportunities by
propagating the undef value further, and eventually removes everything
after the load on the uninitialized stack location:

  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #0 section ".init.text" align 16 !kcfi_type !11 {
    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16
    ...

  12:                                               ; preds = %11
    %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63
    unreachable
  }

In this way, the generated native code will just fall through to the
next function, as LLVM does not generate any code for the unreachable IR
instruction and leaves the function without a terminator.

Zero the on-stack buffer to avoid this possible UB.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 12:51:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0392 | Guangzhou Huayi Intelligent Technology Jeewms graphReportController.do datagridGraph sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0392</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Guangzhou Huayi Intelligent Technology Jeewms up to 20241229.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server that makes remote code execution possible. Please note this was only partially patched in 3.19.3, a fully sufficient patch was not released until 3.19.4. However, another CVE was assigned by another CNA for version 3.19.3 so we will leave this as affecting 3.19.2 and before. We have recommended the vendor use JSON encoding to prevent any further deserialization vulnerabilities from being present.</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 07:35:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42175 | HCL MyXalytics is affected by a weak input validation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42175</link><description>HCL MyXalytics is affected by a weak input validation vulnerability.

Increased memory pressure can cause processes other than snmpd to be at risk for unexpected termination as well.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 20:30:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6437 | On affected platforms running Arista EOS with one of the following features configured to redirect IP traffic to a next hop: policy-based routing (PBR), BGP Flowspec, or interface traffic policy -- certain IP traffic such as IPv4 packets with IP options ma</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6437</link><description>On affected platforms running Arista EOS with one of the following features configured to redirect IP traffic to a next hop: policy-based routing (PBR), BGP Flowspec, or interface traffic policy -- certain IP traffic such as IPv4 packets with IP options may bypass the feature's set nexthop action and be slow-path forwarded (FIB routed) by the kernel as the packets are trapped to the CPU instead of following the redirect action's destination.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 20:15:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12847 | NETGEAR DGN setup.cgi OS Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12847</link><description>NETGEAR DGN1000 before 1.1.00.48 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Prior to 2.10.4, there is a flaw in the authentication in the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter class, which can be bypassed and cause the risk of unauthorized access. In the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter class, ”request.getRequestURI“ is used to obtain the request URL, and it is passed to the "WhitelistUtils.match" method to determine whether the URL request is an interface that does not require authentication. The "match" method filters semicolons, but this is not enough. When users set "server.servlet.context-path" when deploying products, there is still a risk of being bypassed, which can be bypassed by any whitelist prefix /geo/../context-path/.

Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:55:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13239 | Two-factor Authentication (TFA) - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-003</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13239</link><description>Weak Authentication vulnerability in Drupal Two-factor Authentication (TFA) allows Authentication Abuse.This issue affects Two-factor Authentication (TFA): from 0.0.0 before 1.5.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:48:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13238 | Typogrify - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2024-002</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13238</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal Typogrify allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Typogrify: from 0.0.0 before 1.3.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13237 | File Entity (fieldable files) - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-001</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13237</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal File Entity (fieldable files) allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects File Entity (fieldable files): from 7.X-* before 7.X-2.38.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21598 | Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: When BGP traceoptions are configured, receipt of malformed BGP packets causes RPD to crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21598</link><description>An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved's routing protocol daemon (rpd) allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to send malformed BGP packets to a device configured with packet receive trace options enabled to crash rpd.

This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[]: Received malformed update from  (External AS )
and
  rpd[]: Malformed Attribute</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22149 | JWK Set&amp;#x27;s HTTP client only overwrites and appends JWK to local cache during refresh</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22149</link><description>JWK Set (JSON Web Key Set) is a JWK and JWK Set Go implementation.

This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. 

The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models.

Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.

Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page.

file path to , which is then
read by .so


This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit by
either obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trial
and error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)
account to gain access to the .exe CGI binary or .sh
script to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such access
send an HTTP request that triggers it.


Impact: High – The  process, which we assume is
responsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing after
performing the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflow
causes the process to segfault before

Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.

Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station.

temporary file.  The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user's
current `umask` settings, meaning that it's possible for other users on the
same system to read the contents of the temporary file.

Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contents
of this temporary file while a user is editing it.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27980 | Due to the improper handling of batch files in child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync, a malicious command line argument can inject a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27980</link><description>Due to the improper handling of batch files in child_process.spawn / child_process.spawnSync, a malicious command line argument can inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37372 | The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix that can be ignored, which is not alw...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37372</link><description>The Permission Model assumes that any path starting with two backslashes \ has a four-character prefix that can be ignored, which is not always true.
