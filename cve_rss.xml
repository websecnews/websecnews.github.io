From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application contains an input-neutralization flaw in its mail configuration and delivery workflow that allows user-controlled values to flow directly into the system’s sendmail command. Because these values are not sanitized or constrained before being incorporated into the command execution path, certain sendmail behaviors can be unintentionally invoked during email processing. This makes it possible for the application to write files on the server as part of the mail-handling routine, and in deployments where those files end up in web-accessible locations, the behavior can be leveraged to achieve execution of attacker-controlled content. The issue stems entirely from constructing OS-level command strings using unsanitized input within the mail-sending logic. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66225 | OrangeHRM is Vulnerable to Account Takeover Through Unvalidated Username in Password Reset Workflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66225</link><description>OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the password reset workflow does not enforce that the username submitted in the final reset request matches the account for which the reset process was originally initiated. After obtaining a valid reset link for any account they can receive email for, an attacker can alter the username parameter in the final reset request to target a different user. Because the system accepts the supplied username without verification, the attacker can set a new password for any chosen account, including privileged accounts, resulting in full account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66289 | OrangeHRM is Vulnerable to Persistent Session Access Due to Missing Invalidation After User Disable and Password Change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66289</link><description>OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application does not invalidate existing sessions when a user is disabled or when a password change occurs, allowing active session cookies to remain valid indefinitely. As a result, a disabled user, or an attacker using a compromised account, can continue to access protected pages and perform operations as long as a prior session remains active. Because the server performs no session revocation or session-store cleanup during these critical state changes, disabling an account or updating credentials has no effect on already-established sessions. This makes administrative disable actions ineffective and allows unauthorized users to retain full access even after an account is closed or a password is reset, exposing the system to prolonged unauthorized use and significantly increasing the impact of account takeover scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66290 | OrangeHRM is Vulnerable to Improper Authorization Allowing Unauthorized Access to Candidate Attachments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66290</link><description>OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application’s recruitment attachment retrieval endpoint does not enforce the required authorization checks before serving candidate files. Even users restricted to ESS-level access, who have no permission to view the Recruitment module, can directly access candidate attachment URLs. When an authenticated request is made to the attachment endpoint, the system validates the session but does not confirm that the requesting user has the necessary recruitment permissions. As a result, any authenticated user can download CVs and other uploaded documents for arbitrary candidates by issuing direct requests to the attachment endpoint, leading to unauthorized exposure of sensitive applicant data. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:49:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66291 | OrangeHRM is Vulnerable to Improper Authorization Allowing Unauthorized Access to Interview Attachments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66291</link><description>OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the interview attachment retrieval endpoint in the Recruitment module serves files based solely on an authenticated session and user-supplied identifiers, without verifying whether the requester has permission to access the associated interview record. Because the server does not perform any recruitment-level authorization checks, an ESS-level user with no access to recruitment workflows can directly request interview attachment URLs and receive the corresponding files. This exposes confidential interview documents—including candidate CVs, evaluations, and supporting files—to unauthorized users. The issue arises from relying on predictable object identifiers and session presence rather than validating the user’s association with the relevant recruitment process. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:49:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53899 | Kiteworks MFT is vulnerable to an Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53899</link><description>Kiteworks MFT orchestrates end-to-end file transfer workflows.

The vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's tarfile.extractall() method without the security-critical filter='data' parameter. Although Keras attempts to filter unsafe paths using filter_safe_paths(), this filtering occurs before extraction, and a PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits, resulting in a security bypass that allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the cache directory, enabling potential system compromise or malicious code execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations that process tar archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this extraction method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:27:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12143 | Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12143</link><description>Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ABB Terra AC wallbox.This issue affects Terra AC wallbox: through 1.8.33.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:28:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13771 | Uniong｜WebITR - Arbitrary File Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13771</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to exploit Relative Path Traversal to download arbitrary system files.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:59:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13769 | Uniong｜WebITR - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13769</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has a SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands to read database contents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13770 | Uniong｜WebITR - SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13770</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has a SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands to read database contents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13768 | Uniong｜WebITR - Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13768</link><description>WebITR developed by Uniong has an Authentication Bypass vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to log into the system as any user by modifying a specific parameter.

For example, when {name} is used in an email template, it will be replaced with the buyer's name for the final email. If the name of the attendee contained HTML or Markdown formatting, this was rendered as HTML in the resulting email. This way, a user could inject links or other formatted text through a maliciously formatted name. Since pretix applies a strict allow list approach to allowed HTML tags, this could not be abused for XSS or similarly dangerous attack chains. However, it can be used to manipulate emails in a way that makes user-provided content appear in a trustworthy and credible way, which can be abused for phishing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:10:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10476 | WP Fastest Cache &amp;lt;= 1.4.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) DB Cleanup Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10476</link><description>The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_db_fix_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0.
