In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesn’t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm.

PostgreSQL Anonymizer enables users to set security labels on tables to mask specified columns. There is a flaw that allows complex expressions to be provided as a value. This expression is then later used as it to create the masked views leading to SQL Injection. If dynamic masking is enabled, this will lead to privilege escalation to superuser after the label is created. Users that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this vulnerability. The problem is resolved in v1.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:13:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2339 | Improper Input Validation in PostgreSQL Anonymizer 1.2 allows table owner to gain superuser privileges via masking rule</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2339</link><description>PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a vulnerability  that allows a user who owns a table to elevate to superuser. A user can define a masking function for a column and place malicious code in that function. When a privileged user applies the masking rules using the static masking or the anonymous dump method, the malicious code is executed and can grant escalated privileges to the malicious user. PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 does provide a protection against this risk with the restrict_to_trusted_schemas option, but that protection is incomplete. Users that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this vulnerability. The problem is resolved in v1.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:13:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-43855 | IBM SPSS Statistics denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43855</link><description>IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0, 27.0.1, and 28.0 could allow a local user to create multiple files that could exhaust the file handles capacity and cause a denial of service.

These issues are fixed in version 10.6.2 with a new MPU wrapper.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 21:11:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24035 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Setor Informatica SIL 3.1 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the hmessage parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24035</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Setor Informatica SIL 3.1 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the hmessage parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 20:57:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2044 | Unsafe Deserialisation and Remote Code Execution by an Authenticated user in pgAdmin 4</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2044</link><description>pgAdmin 4 uses a file-based session management approach. The session files are saved on disk as pickle objects. When a user performs a request, the value of the session cookie 'pga4_session' is used to retrieve the file, then its content is deserialised, and finally its signature verified.
The cookie value is split in 2 parts at the first '!' character. The first part is the session ID (sid), while the second is the session digest.
 The vulnerability lies in versions of pgAdmin prior to 8.4 where a method loads session files by concatenating the sessions folder - located inside the pgAdmin 4 DATA_DIR - with the session ID. Precisely, the two values are concatenated using the ['os.path.join'] function. It does not set a trusted base-path which should not be escaped</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 20:57:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46169 | IBM DS8900F file manipulation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46169</link><description>IBM DS8900F HMC 89.21.19.0, 89.21.31.0, 89.30.68.0, 89.32.40.0, and 89.33.48.0 could allow an authenticated user to arbitrarily delete a file.

Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 09:26:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41503 | Student Enrollment In PHP v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the Login function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41503</link><description>Student Enrollment In PHP v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the Login function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 09:10:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41014 | code-projects.org Online Job Portal 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the Username parameter for "Employer."</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41014</link><description>code-projects.org Online Job Portal 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the Username parameter for "Employer."</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:58:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41015 | code-projects.org Online Job Portal 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via /Employer/DeleteJob.php?JobId=1.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41015</link><description>code-projects.org Online Job Portal 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via /Employer/DeleteJob.php?JobId=1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-46499 | Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the pat_number parameter at his_admin_view_single...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46499</link><description>Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the pat_number parameter at his_admin_view_single_patient.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:51:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33676 | Sourcecodester Lost and Found Information System's Version 1.0 is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection at "?page=items/view&amp;id=*" whi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33676</link><description>Sourcecodester Lost and Found Information System's Version 1.0 is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection at "?page=items/view&amp;id=*" which can be escalated to the remote command execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:51:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-46498 | Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the doc_number parameter at his_admin_view_single...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46498</link><description>Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the doc_number parameter at his_admin_view_single_employee.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:44:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-46497 | Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the pat_number parameter at his_doc_view_single_p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46497</link><description>Hospital Management System 1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the pat_number parameter at his_doc_view_single_patien.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:44:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1382 | The Restaurant Reservations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.9 via the nd_...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1382</link><description>The Restaurant Reservations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.9 via the nd_rst_layout attribute of the nd_rst_search shortcode.

Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41 of the deno_runtime library, maliciously crafted permission request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name to the user.

If affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed payload is expanded. Router version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability. Those who are unable to upgrade may be able to implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of their Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 21:17:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28102 | JWCrypto vulnerable to JWT bomb Attack in `deserialize` function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28102</link><description>JWCrypto implements JWK, JWS, and JWE specifications using python-cryptography.

Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 21:07:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27933 | Deno arbitrary file descriptor close via `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leading to permission prompt bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27933</link><description>Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.

This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.

Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 21:07:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27934 | *const c_void / ExternalPointer unsoundness leading to use-after-free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27934</link><description>Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime.

Prior to versions 2.6.1, 2.7.3, and 2.8.4, a vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow an attacker to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an account with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only affected if the OIDC provider allows users to create accounts on the provider. During OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly validated against the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could allow a user with a domain that only partially matched an allowed domain to successfully login or register. An attacker could register a domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a Coder instance with a public OIDC provider.

When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free. For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific, and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11. All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0 will ignore invalid tokens, so they are not vulnerable.

This is due to how the `xmlsec1` command line tool is called internally to verify the signature of SAML assertions. When `xmlsec1` is used without defining the enabled key data, the origin of the public key for the signature verification is, unfortunately, not restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions themselves and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key) directly embedded in the SAML token. Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects. The vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed by forking the go-saml project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the `xmlsec1` binary in the verify function. Please note that this workaround must be carefully tested before it can be used.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:21:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27304 | pgx SQL Injection via Protocol Message Size Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27304</link><description>pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go.

spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove

The pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along with
spmi_controller.
On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres
, including the clocks, will be cleanup.
This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks in
the pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.

This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and
building the kernel with KASAN.

Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the
clocks before freeing spmi_controller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 06:52:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52585 | drm/amdgpu: Fix possible NULL dereference in amdgpu_ras_query_error_status_helper()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52585</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/ipoib: Fix mcast list locking

Releasing the `priv-&gt;lock` while iterating the `priv-&gt;multicast_list` in
`ipoib_mcast_join_task()` opens a window for `ipoib_mcast_dev_flush()` to
remove the items while in the middle of iteration. If the mcast is removed
while the lock was dropped, the for loop spins forever resulting in a hard
lockup (as was reported on RHEL 4.18.0-372.75.1.el8_6 kernel):

    the other thread which is blocked  |
    and the list is still valid on     |
    it's stack.)

Fix this by keeping the lock held and changing to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent
eventual sleeps.
Unfortunately we could not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix but
based on the code review I think this fix should address such lockups.

media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue

In rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the
interrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't
be running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as
the interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the
ISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured
frame.

This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
disables the streaming might do things that conflict.

It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with
a suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,
leading to board lockup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 06:53:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52590 | ocfs2: Avoid touching renamed directory if parent does not change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52590</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: s390: fix setting of fpc register

kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu() allows to set the floating point control
(fpc) register of a guest cpu. The new value is tested for validity by
temporarily loading it into the fpc register.

This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process:
if an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc
register, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registers
are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()
assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers
when returning to user space.

test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process fpc register
value, however it will be discarded, when returning to user space.

In result the host process will incorrectly continue to run with the value
that was supposed to be used for a guest cpu.

Fix this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before
the SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values.

This results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted
instead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,
given that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is in
addition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface
(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 06:53:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52598 | s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52598</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctly

If the content of the floating point control (fpc) register of a traced

The issue is caused when the value of fsi becomes less than -1.
The check to break the loop when fsi value becomes -1 is present
but syzbot was able to produce value less than -1 which cause the error.
This patch simply add the change for the values less than 0.

pds_core: Prevent race issues involving the adminq

There are multiple paths that can result in using the pdsc's
adminq.

[1] pdsc_adminq_isr and the resulting work from queue_work(),
    i.e. pdsc_work_thread()-&gt;pdsc_process_adminq()

[2] pdsc_adminq_post()

When the device goes through reset via PCIe reset and/or
a fw_down/fw_up cycle due to bad PCIe state or bad device
state the adminq is destroyed and recreated.

A NULL pointer dereference can happen if [1] or [2] happens
after the adminq is already destroyed.

In order to fix this, add some further state checks and
implement reference counting for adminq uses. Reference
counting was used because multiple threads can attempt to
access the adminq at the same time via [1] or [2]. Additionally,
multiple clients (i.e. pds-vfio-pci) can be using [2]
at the same time.

The adminq_refcnt is initialized to 1 when the adminq has been
allocated and is ready to use. Users/clients of the adminq
(i.e. [1] and [2]) will increment the refcnt when they are using
the adminq. When the driver goes into a fw_down cycle it will
set the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD bit and then wait for the adminq_refcnt
to hit 1. Setting the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD before waiting will prevent
any further adminq_refcnt increments. Waiting for the
adminq_refcnt to hit 1 allows for any current users of the adminq
to finish before the driver frees the adminq. Once the
adminq_refcnt hits 1 the driver clears the refcnt to signify that
the adminq is deleted and cannot be used. On the fw_up cycle the
driver will once again initialize the adminq_refcnt to 1 allowing
the adminq to be used again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 06:53:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26624 | af_unix: fix lockdep positive in sk_diag_dump_icons()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26624</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: fix lockdep positive in sk_diag_dump_icons()

syzbot reported a lockdep splat [1].

Blamed commit hinted about the possible lockdep
violation, and code used unix_state_lock_nested()
in an attempt to silence lockdep.

It is not sufficient, because unix_state_lock_nested()
is already used from unix_state_double_lock().

We need to use a separate subclass.

This patch adds a distinct enumeration to make things
more explicit.

Also use swap() in unix_state_double_lock() as a clean up.

v2: add a missing inline keyword to unix_state_lock_nested()

scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler

Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called &amp; checked with host
lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.

This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:

 - N hardware queues

 - queue depth is M for each hardware queue

 - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests

If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called
for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -
1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.

If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring
host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).

Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't
need the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never
covers that.

other info that might help us debug this:

Chain exists of:
  (work_completion)(&amp;svm_bo-&gt;eviction_work) --&gt; &amp;mm-&gt;mmap_lock --&gt; &amp;svms-&gt;lock

 Possible unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&amp;svms-&gt;lock);
                               lock(&amp;mm-&gt;mmap_lock);
                               lock(&amp;svms-&gt;lock);
  lock((work_completion)(&amp;svm_bo-&gt;eviction_work));

I believe this cannot really lead to a deadlock in practice, because
svm_range_evict_svm_bo_worker only takes the mmap_read_lock if the BO
refcount is non-0. That means it's impossible that svm_range_bo_release
is running concurrently. However, there is no good way to annotate this.

To avoid the problem, take a BO reference in
svm_range_schedule_evict_svm_bo instead of in the worker. That way it's
impossible for a BO to get freed while eviction work is pending and the
cancel_work_sync call in svm_range_bo_release can be eliminated.

v2: Use svm_bo_ref_unless_zero and explained why that's safe. Also
removed redundant checks that are already done in
amdkfd_fence_enable_signaling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 06:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1760 | The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forg...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1760</link><description>The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.6.20.
