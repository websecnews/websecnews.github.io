The variable not properly escaped is the "id", which is not directly accessible by users creating pipelines making the risk of exploiting this low.

This issue only affects users using the Hop Server component and does not directly affect the client.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:27:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25942 | Dell PowerEdge Server BIOS contains an Improper SMM communication buffer verification vulnerability.

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.
An attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 04:37:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2622 | Fujian Kelixin Communication Command and Dispatch Platform editemedia.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2622</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Fujian Kelixin Communication Command and Dispatch Platform up to 20240318.

Due to a improper use of the `text/template` instead of the `html/template` package, the Login UI did not sanitize input parameters prior to versions 2.47.3, 2.46.1, 2.45.1, 2.44.3, 2.43.9, 2.42.15, and 2.41.15. An attacker could create a malicious link, where he injected code which would be rendered as part of the login screen. While it was possible to inject HTML including JavaScript, the execution of such scripts would be prevented by the Content Security Policy. Versions 2.47.3, 2.46.1, 2.45.1, 2.44.3, 2.43.9, 2.42.15, and 2.41.15 contain a patch for this issue.

A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28250 | Cilium has possible unencrypted traffic between nodes when using WireGuard and L7 policies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28250</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:22:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28237 | OctoPrint XSS via the &amp;quot;Snapshot Test&amp;quot; feature in Classic Webcam plugin settings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28237</link><description>OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights into configuring a webcam snapshot URL which when tested through the "Test" button included in the web interface will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser when attempting to render the snapshot image. An attacker who successfully talked a victim with admin rights into performing a snapshot test with such a crafted URL could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.10.0rc3. OctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly vet who has admin access to their installation and what settings they modify based on instructions by strangers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:22:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23333 | LAM vulnerable to Authenticated Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23333</link><description>LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory. LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrary paths for log files. Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7. As a workaround, limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorized users.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:15:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2604 | SourceCodester File Manager App update-file.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2604</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester File Manager App 1.0.

A bug exists in the cloud ClickHouse offering prior to version 24.0.2.54535 and in github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse version 23.1. Query caching bypasses the role based access controls and the policies being enforced on roles. In affected versions, the query cache only respects separate users, however this is not documented and not expected behavior. People relying on ClickHouse roles can have their access control lists bypassed if they are using query caching. Attackers who have control of a role could guess queries and see data they shouldn't have access to. Version 24.1 of ClickHouse and version 24.0.2.54535 of ClickHouse Cloud contain a patch for this issue. Based on the documentation, role based access control should be enforced regardless if query caching is enabled or not.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:00:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25656 | Improper input validation in AVSystem Unified Management Platform (UMP) 23.07.0.16567~LTS can result in unauthenticated CPE (Customer Premis...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25656</link><description>Improper input validation in AVSystem Unified Management Platform (UMP) 23.07.0.16567~LTS can result in unauthenticated CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) devices storing arbitrarily large amounts of data during registration.

Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13, 2.9.9, or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:48:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21661 | Argo CD Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability Due to Unsafe Array Modification in Multi-threaded Environment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21661</link><description>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code, where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously, the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication, widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20760 | AMS XSS -  /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/js/collection/selectall/selectall.js</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20760</link><description>Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.19 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by an attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields.

PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev-&gt;cdev is held open. The call
to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
trailing put_device(), just before return.

At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev-&gt;mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev-&gt;pdev reference was not a counted
one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
would pass a stale &amp;stdev-&gt;pdev-&gt;dev pointer.

Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev-&gt;pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
future accidents.

block/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow

Since "dev_search_path" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX,
there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string
into "full_path" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were
reporting this warning:

pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number

When the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers,
the zone size will become an odd number.
The address of the zone will become:
    addr of zone0 = BASE
    addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size
    addr of zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2
    ...
The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignment va.
Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va.

So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is even
to avoid this bug.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26639 | mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26639</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section

Alexander Potapenko writes in [1]: "For every memory access in the code
instrumented by KMSAN we call kmsan_get_metadata() to obtain the metadata
for the memory being accessed.  For virtual memory the metadata pointers
are stored in the corresponding `struct page`, therefore we need to call
virt_to_page() to get them.

According to the comment in arch/x86/include/asm/page.h,
virt_to_page(kaddr) returns a valid pointer iff virt_addr_valid(kaddr) is
true, so KMSAN needs to call virt_addr_valid() as well.

To avoid recursion, kmsan_get_metadata() must not call instrumented code,
therefore ./arch/x86/include/asm/kmsan.h forks parts of
arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c to check whether a virtual address is valid or not.

But the introduction of rcu_read_lock() to pfn_valid() added instrumented
RCU API calls to virt_to_page_or_null(), which is called by
kmsan_get_metadata(), so there is an infinite recursion now.  I do not
think it is correct to stop that recursion by doing
kmsan_enter_runtime()/kmsan_exit_runtime() in kmsan_get_metadata(): that
would prevent instrumented functions called from within the runtime from
tracking the shadow values, which might introduce false positives."

Fix the issue by switching pfn_valid() to the _sched() variant of
rcu_read_lock/unlock(), which does not require calling into RCU.  Given
the critical section in pfn_valid() is very small, this is a reasonable
trade-off (with preemptible RCU).

KMSAN further needs to be careful to suppress calls into the scheduler,
which would be another source of recursion.  This can be done by wrapping
the call to pfn_valid() into preempt_disable/enable_no_resched().  The
downside is that this sacrifices breaking scheduling guarantees; however,
a kernel compiled with KMSAN has already given up any performance
guarantees due to being heavily instrumented.

Note, KMSAN code already disables tracing via Makefile, and since mmzone.h
is included, it is not necessary to use the notrace variant, which is
generally preferred in all other cases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26640 | tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26640</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy

TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map pages initially allocated
from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs.

This patch adds to can_map_frag() these additional checks:

- Page must not be a compound one.
- page-&gt;mapping must be NULL.

This fixes the panic reported by ZhangPeng.

syzbot was able to loopback packets built with sendfile(),
mapping pages owned by an ext4 file to TCP rx zerocopy.

binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()

Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.

  Task A            | Task B
  ------------------+------------------
  mmget_not_zero()  |
                    |  do_exit()
                    |    exit_mm()
                    |      mmput()
  mmput()           |
    exit_mmap()     |
      remove_vma()  |
        fput()      |

In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
from Task B that never comes (it's dead).

This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
death notifications will also be delayed until then.

In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
the corresponding mm-&gt;async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52610 | net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52610</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags

act_ct adds skb-&gt;users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order,
the last frag's reference is reset in:

  inet_frag_reasm_prepare
    skb_morph

which is not straightforward.

However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and
all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet
capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the
same time.

Fix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct
returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.

wifi: rtw88: sdio: Honor the host max_req_size in the RX path

Lukas reports skb_over_panic errors on his Banana Pi BPI-CM4 which comes
with an Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC and a RTL8822CS SDIO wifi/Bluetooth
combo card. The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed
in commit e967229ead0e ("wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST
bit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.

Lukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the
problem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following
discussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on
this problem:
- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller
  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through
  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes
- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is
  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form
- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming
  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO
  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH
  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will
  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation
  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)

Use multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the
number of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one
MMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than
the hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in
one MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error
is gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes
from the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that
or because multiple packets have been aggregated).

In case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we
need to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the

Add condition checking if we are exceeding PAGE_SIZE and exit early from

There is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggers
when the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from
/dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive read
which then dead-locks.

Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52616 | crypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52616</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

to mld_ifc_stop_work() (and mld_gq_stop_work() for good measure) with
mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() accordingly as these functions
should only be called with mc_lock per their declarations.

net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames

Mark reports a BUG() when a net namespace is removed.

    kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520!

Physical interfaces moved outside of init_net get "refunded"
to init_net when that namespace disappears. The main interface
name may get overwritten in the process if it would have
conflicted. We need to also discard all conflicting altnames.
Recent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames get moved
with the main interface, which surfaced this problem.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:28:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26635 | llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26635</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2.

syzbot reported an uninit-value bug below. [0]

llc supports ETH_P_802_2 (0x0004) and used to support ETH_P_TR_802_2
(0x0011), and syzbot abused the latter to trigger the bug.

  write$tun(r0, &amp;(0x7f0000000040)={@val={0x0, 0x11}, @val, @mpls={[], @llc={@snap={0xaa, 0x1, ')', "90e5dd"}}}}, 0x16)

llc_conn_handler() initialises local variables {saddr,daddr}.mac
based on skb in llc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes
them to __llc_lookup().

However, the initialisation is done only when skb-&gt;protocol is
htons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise, __llc_lookup_established() and
__llc_lookup_listener() will read garbage.

The missing initialisation existed prior to commit 211ed865108e
("net: delete all instances of special processing for token ring").

It removed the part to kick out the token ring stuff but forgot to
close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneak into llc_rcv().

Let's remove llc_tr_packet_type and complete the deprecation.

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes

syzbot was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1]

Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb().
Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all the sanity checks
that were performed.

This fix:

- Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space.
- Check all conditions again after socket lock is held again.
- Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.
