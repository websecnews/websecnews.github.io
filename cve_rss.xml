It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor 5 module.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 03:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25063 | An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3.

It does not sufficiently validate uploaded SVG images to ensure they do not contain potentially dangerous SVG tags. SVG images can contain clickable links and executable scripting, and using a crafted SVG, it is possible to execute scripting in the browser when an SVG image is viewed. This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing to be able to upload SVG images, and that Backdrop embeds all uploaded SVG images within &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags, which prevents scripting from executing. The SVG must be viewed directly by its URL in order to run any embedded scripting.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 03:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20141 | In V5 DA, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
