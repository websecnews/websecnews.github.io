It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:54:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37934 | An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacke...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37934</link><description>An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacker to perform a denial of service attack via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests in a high frequency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44250 | An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a For...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44250</link><description>An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a FortiProxy HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 allows an authenticated attacker to perform elevated actions via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46712 | A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46712</link><description>A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attacker to escalate its privilege via specifically crafted HTTP requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48783 | An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48783</link><description>An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and below, version 6.0.14 and below, version 5.3.8 and below may allow a remote authenticated user with at least read-only permissions to access to other organization endpoints via crafted GET requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37932 | An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37932</link><description>An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0.0 and before 6.4.7 allows an authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the system via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 17:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-29444 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PTC&amp;#x27;s Kepware KEPServerEX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29444</link><description>An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability (DLL hijacking) has been discovered that could allow a locally authenticated adversary to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

Anyone leveraging the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol or the `SignedHttpRequestValidator`is vulnerable. Microsoft.IdentityModel trusts the `jku`claim by default for the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol. This raises the possibility to make any remote or local `HTTP GET` request. The vulnerability has been fixed in Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest. Users should update all their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 04:34:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0364 | PHPGurukul Hospital Management System query-details.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0364</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 1.0.

Before version 2.11.0, the react-native-mmkv logged the optional encryption key for the MMKV database into the Android system log. The key can be obtained by anyone with access to the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) if it is enabled in the phone settings. This bug is not present on iOS devices. By logging the encryption secret to the system logs, attackers can trivially recover the secret by enabling ADB and undermining an app's thread model. This issue has been patched in version 2.11.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:17:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21319 | Microsoft Identity Denial of service vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21319</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:17:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0341 | Inis GET Request File.php path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0341</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Inis up to 2.0.1.

contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 16:47:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-36763 | Heap Buffer Overflow in Tcg2MeasureGptTable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36763</link><description>EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasureGptTable() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network.
