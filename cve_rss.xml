are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or
possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to
different and unrelated sites and domains.

It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that
verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For
example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower
case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 01:53:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6566 | Business Logic Errors in microweber/microweber</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6566</link><description>Business Logic Errors in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:53:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46353 | In the module "Product Tag Icons Pro" (ticons) before 1.8.4 from MyPresta.eu for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection.

In affected versions there is an argument injection in the VideosController, specifically the `/Videos/&lt;itemId&gt;/stream` and `/Videos/&lt;itemId&gt;/stream.&lt;container&gt;` endpoints which are present in the current Jellyfin version. Additional endpoints in the AudioController might also be vulnerable, as they differ only slightly in execution. Those endpoints are reachable by an unauthenticated user. In order to exploit this vulnerability an unauthenticated attacker has to guess an itemId, which is a completely random GUID. It’s a very unlikely case even for a large media database with lots of items. Without an additional information leak, this vulnerability shouldn’t be directly exploitable, even if the instance is reachable from the Internet. There are a lot of query parameters that get accepted by the method. At least two of those, videoCodec and audioCodec are vulnerable to the argument injection. The values can be traced through a lot of code and might be changed in the process. However, the fallback is to always use them as-is, which means we can inject our own arguments. Those arguments land in the command line of FFmpeg. Because UseShellExecute is always set to false, we can’t simply terminate the FFmpeg command and execute our own. It should only be possible to add additional arguments to FFmpeg, which is powerful enough as it stands. There is probably a way of overwriting an arbitrary file with malicious content. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 10.8.13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 19:24:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6393 | Quarkus: potential invalid reuse of context when @cacheresult on a uni is used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6393</link><description>A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial "completion" context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context.

A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45285 | Command &amp;#x27;go get&amp;#x27; may unexpectedly fallback to insecure git in cmd/go</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45285</link><description>Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure "https://" and "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module.

The Microsoft Graph PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that enabled the use of the phpInfo() function from any application that could access and execute the file at vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php.  The phpInfo function exposes system information. The vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of the PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function. This vulnerability requires a misconfiguration of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making the PHP application’s /vendor directory web accessible. The combination of the vulnerability and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes the phpinfo() method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information like configuration, modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised secrets to access additional data. This problem has been patched in versions 1.109.1 and 2.0.0-RC5.

In affected versions there is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability via the upload image from url api. Users who have access to `the /Attachment/fromImageUrl` endpoint can specify URL to point to an internal host. Even though there is check for content type, it can be bypassed by redirects in some cases. This SSRF can be leveraged to disclose internal information (in some cases), target internal hosts and bypass firewalls.

Unsafe YAML deserilization will result in arbitrary code execution. A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious yaml file is present in the same directory. This vulnerability does not require the file to be directly loaded through the code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit `c57355dc` which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are advised to upgrade.

In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to recover session key bits. In Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe exhibits any timing side channels.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 16:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44298 | Dell PowerEdge platforms 16G Intel E5 BIOS and Dell Precision BIOS, version 1.4.4, contain active debug code security vulnerability.
