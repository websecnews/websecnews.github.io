An attacker can use DeviceIoControl with the unvalidated parameters 0x9C402440 and 0x9C402444 as IoControlCodes to perform RDMSR and WRMSR, respectively. Through this process, the attacker can modify MSR_LSTAR and hook KiSystemCall64. Afterward, using Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), the attacker can manipulate the stack with pre-prepared gadgets, disable the SMAP flag in the CR4 register, and execute a user-mode syscall handler in the kernel context. It has not been confirmed whether this works on 32-bit Windows, but it functions on 64-bit Windows if the core isolation feature is either absent or disabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 18:31:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50454 | An Authentication Bypass vulnerability in Blue Access' Cobalt X1 thru 02.000.187 allows an unauthorized attacker to log into the application...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50454</link><description>An Authentication Bypass vulnerability in Blue Access' Cobalt X1 thru 02.000.187 allows an unauthorized attacker to log into the application as an administrator without valid credentials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 18:31:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51857 | The reconcile method in the AttachmentReconciler class of the Halo system v.2.20.18LTS and before is vulnerable to XSS attacks.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51857</link><description>The reconcile method in the AttachmentReconciler class of the Halo system v.2.20.18LTS and before is vulnerable to XSS attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50688 | A command injection vulnerability exists in TwistedWeb (version 14.0.0) due to improper input sanitization in the file upload functionality....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50688</link><description>A command injection vulnerability exists in TwistedWeb (version 14.0.0) due to improper input sanitization in the file upload functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP PUT request to upload a malicious file (e.g., a reverse shell script). Once uploaded, the attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary commands on the target system, allowing for remote code execution. This could lead to escalation of privileges depending on the privileges of the web server process. The attack does not require physical access and can be conducted remotely, posing a significant risk to the confidentiality and integrity of the system.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:45:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51627 | Incorrect access control in CaricaVerbale in Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 allows authenticated attackers with low-level access to escala...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51627</link><description>Incorrect access control in CaricaVerbale in Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 allows authenticated attackers with low-level access to escalate privileges to Administrator.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:45:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8586 | libav MPEG File Parser utils.c ff_seek_frame_binary null pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8586</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in libav up to 12.3.

This allows a malicious actor to craft a fake installer with a forged SHA-1 certificate that may still be accepted by Windows signature verification mechanisms, particularly on systems without strict SmartScreen or trust policy enforcement. Additionally, the installer lacks High Entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), as confirmed by BinSkim (BA2015 rule) and repeated WinDbg analysis. The binary consistently loads into predictable memory ranges, increasing the success rate of memory corruption exploits. These two misconfigurations, when combined, significantly lower the bar for successful supply-chain style attacks or privilege escalation through fake installers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 21:25:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50754 | Unisite CMS version 5.0 contains a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Report" functionality.
