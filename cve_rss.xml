Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 12:55:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5707 | The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all ve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5707</link><description>The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

It is susceptible to a vulnerability where multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active Directory Users.

Versions prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45338 | Online Food Ordering System v1.0 - Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections (SQLi)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45338</link><description>Online Food Ordering System v1.0 is vulnerable to multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
