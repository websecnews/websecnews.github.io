If an attacker can reach these interfaces - most often through local or near-local access such as connecting to the USB or Ethernet ports beneath the table - the built-in credentials permit administrative login and full control of the system. Once authenticated, an attacker can access firmware utilities, modify controller software, and establish persistent compromise. Remote attack paths via network, cellular, or telemetry links may exist in specific configurations but generally require additional capabilities or operator error.

can: hi311x: fix null pointer dereference when resuming from sleep before interface was enabled

This issue is similar to the vulnerability in the `mcp251x` driver,
which was fixed in commit 03c427147b2d ("can: mcp251x: fix resume from
sleep before interface was brought up").

In the `hi311x` driver, when the device resumes from sleep, the driver
schedules `priv-&gt;restart_work`. However, if the network interface was
not previously enabled, the `priv-&gt;wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and
initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.

To fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue
from the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.
This ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is
used during device resume. And added logic to destroy the workqueue
in the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the
`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:27:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0987 | IDOR in CB Project&amp;#x27;s CVLand</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0987</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in CB Project Ltd.
