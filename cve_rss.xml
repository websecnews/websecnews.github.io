scripting is utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises 
from the absence of proper security controls that restrict which Python 
libraries can be imported and executed within the scripting environment.
 The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having system 
permissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an 
authenticated administrator uploads a malicious project file containing 
Python scripts with bind shell capabilities, the application executes 
these scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition Gateway process, 
which typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. 
Alternative code execution patterns could lead to similar results.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59529 | simple protocol server ignores accepts unlimited connections and logs failures without limit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59529</link><description>Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:27:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63947 | A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in phpMsAdmin version 2.2 in the database_mode.php file.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request with a very large SEID (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that causes an integer conversion/underflow in LocalNode.DeleteSess() / LocalNode.Sess() when a uint64 SEID is converted to int and used in index arithmetic. This leads to a negative index into n.sess and a Go runtime panic, resulting in a denial of service (UPF crash). The issue has been reproduced on free5GC v4.1.0 with crashes observed in the session lookup/deletion path in internal/pfcp/node.go; other versions may also be affected. No authentication is required.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:58:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65563 | A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (component upf-epc/pfcpiface) up to at least version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65563</link><description>A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (component upf-epc/pfcpiface) up to at least version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev.

usb: typec: ucsi: fix use-after-free caused by uec-&gt;work

The delayed work uec-&gt;work is scheduled in gaokun_ucsi_probe()
but never properly canceled in gaokun_ucsi_remove(). This creates
use-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure
are freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the
gaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing
or still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi
or ucsi structure may then be accessed.

Furthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently
long to make this bug easily reproducible. The following is the

scsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work

The delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and
scheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the
IMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),
the imm_struct device instance is deallocated.

However, the delayed work might still be pending or executing
when imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs
when the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already
freed imm_struct memory.

The race condition can occur as follows:

CPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1
                       | imm_queuecommand()
                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()
imm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()
  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()
                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE
                           dev-&gt; //USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper
cancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68325 | net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68325</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63757 | Integer overflow vulnerability in the yuv2ya16_X_c_template function in libswscale/output.c in FFmpeg 8.0.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-63757</link><description>Integer overflow vulnerability in the yuv2ya16_X_c_template function in libswscale/output.c in FFmpeg 8.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:02:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64468 | Use-after-Free in sentry!sentry_span_set_data() in NI LabVIEW</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64468</link><description>There is a use-after-free vulnerability in sentry!sentry_span_set_data() when parsing a corrupted VI file.

The server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers: "device", "sku", "type", and a client‑computed "value", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret originating from the device itself.

The vulnerability has been verified for the Govee H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected devices. The vendor is not able to provide a list of affected products, but rolls out a firmware and server-side fixes.

In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:51:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14833 | code-projects Online Appointment Booking System deletemanagerclinic.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14833</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in code-projects Online Appointment Booking System 1.0.

A vulnerability present starting in versions 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, and 10.1.10 relates to Storybook’s handling of environment variables defined in a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command. When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable, thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. For a project to potentially be vulnerable to this issue, it must build the Storybook (i.e. run `storybook build` directly or indirectly) in a directory that contains a `.env` file (including variants like `.env.local`) and publish the built Storybook to the web. Storybooks built without a `.env` file at build time are not affected, including common CI-based builds where secrets are provided via platform environment variables rather than `.env` files. Storybook runtime environments (i.e. `storybook dev`) are not affected. Deployed applications that share a repo with your Storybook are not affected. Users should upgrade their Storybook—on both their local machines and CI environment—to version .6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, or 10.1.10 as soon as possible. Maintainers additionally recommend that users audit for any sensitive secrets provided via `.env` files and rotate those keys. Some projects may have been relying on the undocumented behavior at the heart of this issue and will need to change how they reference environment variables after this update. If a project can no longer read necessary environmental variable values, either prefix the variables with `STORYBOOK_` or use the `env` property in Storybook’s configuration to manually specify values. In either case, do not include sensitive secrets as they will be included in the built bundle.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68434 | opensourcepos has Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability that leads to Unauthorized Administrator Creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68434</link><description>Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68143 | mcp-server-git&amp;#x27;s unrestricted git_init tool allows repository creation at arbitrary filesystem locations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68143</link><description>Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the model context protocol (MCP).

The fix adds path validation that resolves both the configured repository and the requested path (following symlinks) and verifies the requested path is within the allowed repository before executing any git operations.

Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the "Return Policy" configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the "Store Configuration" (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the "Return Policy" field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14832 | itsourcecode Online Cake Ordering System updateproduct.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14832</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in itsourcecode Online Cake Ordering System 1.0.

Prior to version 3.20.0, a vulnerability exists in FreeRDP’s certificate handling code on Windows platforms. The function `freerdp_certificate_data_hash_ uses` the Microsoft-specific `_snprintf` function to format certificate cache filenames without guaranteeing NUL termination when truncation occurs. According to Microsoft documentation, `_snprintf` does not append a terminating NUL byte if the formatted output exceeds the destination buffer size. If an attacker controls the hostname value (for example via server redirection or a crafted .rdp file), the resulting filename buffer may not be NUL-terminated. Subsequent string operations performed on this buffer may read beyond the allocated memory region, resulting in a heap-based out-of-bounds read. In default configurations, the connection is typically terminated before sensitive data can be meaningfully exposed, but unintended memory read or a client crash may still occur under certain conditions. Version 3.20.0 has a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:15:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68129 | Auth0-PHP SDK has Improper Audience Validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68129</link><description>Auth0-PHP is a PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs.

Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:33:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68109 | ChurchCRM vulnerable to RCE with database restore functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68109</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, the Database Restore functionality does not validate the content or file extension of uploaded files. As a result, an attacker can upload a web shell file and subsequently upload a .htaccess file to enable direct access to it. Once accessed, the uploaded web shell allows remote code execution (RCE) on the server. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:33:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67873 | Capstone doesn&amp;#x27;t check Skipdata length, leading to cs_insn.bytes heap buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67873</link><description>Capstone is a disassembly framework.

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM prior to version 6.5.3. An authenticated user with specific mid-level permissions ("Edit Records" and "Manage Properties and Classifications") can inject a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload into an administrator's profile. The payload executes when the administrator views their own profile page, allowing the attacker to hijack the administrator's session, perform administrative actions, and achieve a full account takeover. This vulnerability is a combination of two separate flaws: an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) that allows any user to view any other user's profile, and a Broken Access Control vulnerability that allows a user with general edit permissions to modify any other user's record properties. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67876 | ChurchCRM has Stored XSS in Group Role Name Leading to Admin Session Hijacking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67876</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM versions 6.4.0 and prior that allows a low-privilege user with the “Manage Groups” permission to inject persistent JavaScript into group role names. The payload is saved in the database and executed whenever any user (including administrators) views a page that displays that role, such as GroupView.php or PersonView.php. This allows full session hijacking and account takeover. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68114 | Capstone doesn&amp;#x27;t check vsnprintf return in SStream_concat, allows stack buffer underflow and overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68114</link><description>Capstone is a disassembly framework.

A vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 fragmentation reassembly implementation of RIOT OS v2025.07. When copying the contents of the first fragment (offset=0) into the reassembly buffer, no size check is performed. It is possible to force the creation of a small reassembly buffer by first sending a shorter fragment (also with offset=0). Overflowing the reassembly buffer corrupts the state of other packet buffers which an attacker might be able to used to achieve further memory corruption (potentially resulting in remote code execution). To trigger the vulnerability, the `gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag` module must be included and the attacker must be able to send arbitrary IPv6 packets to the victim. Version 2025.10 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 20:42:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14759 | The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for .NET is an open-source client-side encryption library used to facilitate writing and reading encrypted r...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14759</link><description>The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for .NET is an open-source client-side encryption library used to facilitate writing and reading encrypted records to S3.

A vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 fragmentation reassembly implementation of RIOT OS v2025.07. When receiving an fragmented IPv6 packet with fragment offset 0 and an empty payload, the payload pointer is set to NULL. However, the implementation still tries to copy the payload into the reassembly buffer, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference which crashes the OS (DoS). To trigger the vulnerability, the `gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag` module must be enabled and the attacker must be able to send arbitrary IPv6 packets to the victim. RIOT OS v2025.10 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:37:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67074 | A Buffer overflow vulnerability in function fromAdvSetMacMtuWan of bin httpd in Tenda AC10V4.0 V16.03.10.20 allows remote attackers to cause...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67074</link><description>A Buffer overflow vulnerability in function fromAdvSetMacMtuWan of bin httpd in Tenda AC10V4.0 V16.03.10.20 allows remote attackers to cause denial of service and possibly code execution by sending a post request with a crafted payload (field `serverName`) to /goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:37:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66396 | ChurchCRM has SQL Injection in User Editor via `type` Parameter Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66396</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `src/UserEditor.php` file. When an administrator saves a user's configuration settings, the keys of the `type` POST parameter array are not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows a malicious or compromised administrator account to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks, to directly interact with the database. The vulnerability is located in `src/UserEditor.php` within the logic that handles saving user-specific configuration settings. The `type` parameter from the POST request is processed as an array. The code iterates through this array and uses `key($type)` to extract the array key, which is expected to be a numeric ID. This key is then assigned to the `$id` variable. The `$id` variable is subsequently concatenated directly into a `SELECT` and an `UPDATE` SQL query without any sanitization or validation, making it an injection vector. Although the vulnerability requires administrator privileges to exploit, it allows a malicious or compromised admin account to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can be used to bypass any application-level logging or restrictions, directly manipulate the database, exfiltrate, modify, or delete all data (including other user credentials, financial records, and personal information), and could potentially lead to further system compromise, such as writing files to the server, depending on the database's configuration and user privileges. Version 6.5.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:23:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66397 | ChurchCRM&amp;#x27;s Kiosk Manager Functions are vulnerable to Broken Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66397</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system.

Prior to version 5.21.0, a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in ChurchCRM's setup wizard allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code during the initial installation process, leading to complete server compromise. The vulnerability exists in `setup/routes/setup.php` where user input from the setup form is directly concatenated into a PHP configuration template without any validation or sanitization. Any parameter in the setup form can be used to inject PHP code that gets written to `Include/Config.php`, which is then executed on every page load. This is more severe than typical authenticated RCE vulnerabilities because it requires no credentials and affects the installation process that administrators must complete. Version 5.21.0 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:23:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66395 | SQL Injection in Event List via `WhichType` Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66395</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system.

This issue affects Apache Airflow Providers Edge3: before 2.0.0 - and only if you installed and configured it on Airflow 2.



The Edge3 provider support in Airflow 2 has been always development-only and not officially released, however if you installed and configured Edge3 provider in Airflow 2, it implicitly enabled non-public (normally) API which was used to test Edge Provider in Airflow 2 during the development. This API allowed Dag author to perform Remote Code Execution in the webserver context, which Dag Author was not supposed to be able to do.

If you installed and configured Edge3 provider for Airflow 2, you should uninstall it and migrate to Airflow 3. The new Edge3 provider versions (&gt;=2.0.0) has minimum version of Airflow set to 3 and the RCE-prone Airflow 2 code is removed, so it should no longer be possible to use the Edge3 provider 2.0.0+ on Airflow 2.

If you used Edge Provider in Airflow 3, you are not affected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:54:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14101 | IDOR in GG Soft&amp;#x27;s PaperWork</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14101</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in GG Soft Software Services Inc.

Starting in version 0.3.0 and prior to version 1.0.0-alpha-1, a nil pointer dereference vulnerability is in the SIPGO library's `NewResponseFromRequest` function that affects all normal SIP operations. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash any SIP application by sending a single malformed SIP request without a To header. The vulnerability occurs when SIP message parsing succeeds for a request missing the To header, but the response creation code assumes the To header exists without proper nil checks. This affects routine operations like call setup, authentication, and message handling - not just error cases. This vulnerability affects all SIP applications using the sipgo library, not just specific configurations or edge cases, as long as they make use of the `NewResponseFromRequest` function.

Prior to version 1.17.7, several builtin functions in Expr, including `flatten`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `median`, perform recursive traversal over user-provided data structures without enforcing a maximum recursion depth. If the evaluation environment contains deeply nested or cyclic data structures, these functions may recurse indefinitely until exceed the Go runtime stack limit. This results in a stack overflow panic, causing the host application to crash. While exploitability depends on whether an attacker can influence or inject cyclic or pathologically deep data into the
evaluation environment, this behavior represents a denial-of-service (DoS) risk and affects overall library robustness. Instead of returning a recoverable evaluation error, the process may terminate unexpectedly. In affected versions, evaluation of expressions that invoke certain builtin functions on untrusted or insufficiently validated data structures can lead to a process-level crash due to stack exhaustion. This issue is most relevant in scenarios where Expr is used to evaluate expressions against externally supplied or dynamically constructed environments; cyclic references (directly or indirectly) can be introduced into arrays, maps, or structs; and there are no application-level safeguards preventing deeply nested input data. In typical use cases with controlled, acyclic data, the issue may not manifest. However, when present, the resulting panic can be used to reliably crash the application, constituting a denial of service. The issue has been fixed in the v1.17.7 versions of Expr. The patch introduces a maximum recursion depth limit for affected builtin functions. When this limit is exceeded, evaluation aborts gracefully and returns a descriptive error instead of panicking. Additionally, the maximum depth can be customized by users via `builtin.MaxDepth`, allowing applications with legitimate deep structures to raise the limit in a controlled manner. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the patched release, which includes both the recursion guard and comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, some mitigations are recommended. Ensure that evaluation environments cannot contain cyclic references, validate or sanitize externally supplied data structures before passing them to Expr, and/or wrap expression evaluation with panic recovery to prevent a full process crash (as a last-resort defensive measure).

In versions prior to 3.20.1, a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition allows local attackers to corrupt or truncate arbitrary user files through symlink attacks. The vulnerability exists in both Unix and Windows lock file creation where filelock checks if a file exists before opening it with O_TRUNC. An attacker can create a symlink pointing to a victim file in the time gap between the check and open, causing os.open() to follow the symlink and truncate the target file. All users of filelock on Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows systems are impacted. The vulnerability cascades to dependent libraries. The attack requires local filesystem access and ability to create symlinks (standard user permissions on Unix; Developer Mode on Windows 10+). Exploitation succeeds within 1-3 attempts when lock file paths are predictable. The issue is fixed in version 3.20.1. If immediate upgrade is not possible, use SoftFileLock instead of UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock (note: different locking semantics, may not be suitable for all use cases); ensure lock file directories have restrictive permissions (chmod 0700) to prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks; and/or monitor lock file directories for suspicious symlinks before running trusted applications. These workarounds provide only partial mitigation. The race condition remains exploitable. Upgrading to version 3.20.1 is strongly recommended.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68150 | Parse Server has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Instagram OAuth Adapter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68150</link><description>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1, the Instagram authentication adapter allows clients to specify a custom API URL via the `apiURL` parameter in `authData`. This enables SSRF attacks and possibly authentication bypass if malicious endpoints return fake responses to validate unauthorized users. This is fixed in versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1 by hardcoding the Instagram Graph API URL `https://graph.instagram.com` and ignoring client-provided `apiURL` values. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:52:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68154 | Command Injection in fsSize() on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68154</link><description>systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function. If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable. Version 5.27.14 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:52:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68155 | @vitejs/plugin-rsc has Arbitrary File Read via `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` Endpoint on Development</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68155</link><description>@vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite.

While creating the stack trace, the unwinder uses the stack pointer to guess
the previous frame to read the previous stack pointer from memory.  The crash
happens, because the unwinder tries to read from unaligned memory and as such
triggers the unalignment trap handler which then leads to the spinlock
recursion and finally to a deadlock.

No kernel log of the exact same error with an upstream kernel is
available - but the very same deadlock situation can be constructed there,
too:

- task: kmcheck
  mlx5_unload_one() tries to acquire devlink lock while the PCI error
  recovery code has set pdev-&gt;block_cfg_access by way of
  pci_cfg_access_lock()
- task: kworker
  mlx5_crdump_collect() tries to set block_cfg_access through
  pci_cfg_access_lock() while devlink_health_report() had acquired
  the devlink lock.

A similar deadlock situation can be reproduced by requesting a
crdump with
  &gt; devlink health dump show pci/ reporter fw_fatal

while PCI error recovery is executed on the same  physical function
by mlx5_core's pci_error_handlers. On s390 this can be injected with
  &gt; zpcictl --reset-fw 

Tests with this patch failed to reproduce that second deadlock situation,
the devlink command is rejected with "kernel answers: Permission denied" -
and we get a kernel log message of:

mlx5_core 1ed0:00:00.1: mlx5_crdump_collect:50:(pid 254382): crdump: failed to lock vsc gw err -5

because the config read of VSC_SEMAPHORE is rejected by the underlying
hardware.

Two prior attempts to address this issue have been discussed and
ultimately rejected [see link], with the primary argument that s390's
implementation of PCI error recovery is imposing restrictions that
neither powerpc's EEH nor PCI AER handling need. Tests show that PCI
error recovery on s390 is running to completion even without blocking
access to PCI config space.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:42:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68311 | tty: serial: ip22zilog: Use platform device for probing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68311</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: Prevents free active kevent

The root cause of this issue are:
1. When probing the usbnet device, executing usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0);
put the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent has not yet
been scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing
free_netdev() results in the "free active object (kevent)" error reported
here.

2. Another factor is that when calling usbnet_disconnect()-&gt;unregister_netdev(),
if the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop() is executed to cancel the kevent.
However, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not executed.

The solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before executing
free_netdev().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:42:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68313 | x86/CPU/AMD: Add RDSEED fix for Zen5</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68313</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix invalid probe error return value

After DME Link Startup, the error return value is set to the MIPI UniPro
GenericErrorCode which can be 0 (SUCCESS) or 1 (FAILURE).  Upon failure
during driver probe, the error code 1 is propagated back to the driver
probe function which must return a negative value to indicate an error,
but 1 is not negative, so the probe is considered to be successful even
though it failed.  Subsequently, removing the driver results in an oops
because it is not in a valid state.

This happens because none of the callers of ufshcd_init() expect a
non-negative error code.

netconsole: Acquire su_mutex before navigating configs hierarchy

There is a race between operations that iterate over the userdata
cg_children list and concurrent add/remove of userdata items through
configfs. The update_userdata() function iterates over the
nt-&gt;userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also
iterates over this same list to count nodes.

Quoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:
&gt; A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer
&gt; to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'
&gt; management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to
&gt; protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the
&gt; hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem
&gt; mutex.

Without proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed
concurrently while these functions are iterating, the list can be
accessed in an inconsistent state. For example, the list_for_each() loop
can reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()
which sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will
never end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).

Fix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all
operations that iterate over cg_children.
This includes:
- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over
  cg_children
- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call
  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children

usb: gadget: udc: fix use-after-free in usb_gadget_state_work

A race condition during gadget teardown can lead to a use-after-free
in usb_gadget_state_work(), as reported by KASAN:

  BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in sysfs_notify+0x2c/0xd0
  Workqueue: events usb_gadget_state_work

The fundamental race occurs because a concurrent event (e.g., an
interrupt) can call usb_gadget_set_state() and schedule gadget-&gt;work
at any time during the cleanup process in usb_del_gadget().

Commit 399a45e5237c ("usb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after
device removal") attempted to fix this by moving flush_work() to after
device_del(). However, this does not fully solve the race, as a new
work item can still be scheduled *after* flush_work() completes but
before the gadget's memory is freed, leading to the same use-after-free.

This patch fixes the race condition robustly by introducing a 'teardown'
flag and a 'state_lock' spinlock to the usb_gadget struct. The flag is
set during cleanup in usb_del_gadget() *before* calling flush_work() to
prevent any new work from being scheduled once cleanup has commenced.
The scheduling site, usb_gadget_set_state(), now checks this flag under
the lock before queueing the work, thus safely closing the race window.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68283 | libceph: replace BUG_ON with bounds check for map-&amp;gt;max_osd</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68283</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exceeded in case wait_event_interruptible_timeout() slept more than
once) and access client-&gt;auth_err under client-&gt;monc.mutex to match
how it's set in finish_auth().

monmap_show() and osdmap_show() now take the respective lock before

usb: dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths

This patch addresses a race condition caused by unsynchronized
execution of multiple call paths invoking `dwc3_remove_requests()`,
leading to premature freeing of USB requests and subsequent crashes.

Three distinct execution paths interact with `dwc3_remove_requests()`:
Path 1:
Triggered via `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()` during USB reset
handling. The call stack includes:
- `dwc3_ep0_reset_state()`
- `dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart()`
- `dwc3_ep0_out_start()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()`
- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`

Path 2:
Also initiated from `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()`, but through
`dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`. The call stack includes:
- `dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()`
- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`

Path 3:
Occurs independently during `adb root` execution, which triggers
USB function unbind and bind operations. The sequence includes:
- `gserial_disconnect()`
- `usb_ep_disable()`
- `dwc3_gadget_ep_disable()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()` with `-ESHUTDOWN` status

Path 3 operates asynchronously and lacks synchronization with Paths
1 and 2. When Path 3 completes, it disables endpoints and frees 'out'
requests. If Paths 1 or 2 are still processing these requests,
accessing freed memory leads to a crash due to use-after-free conditions.

To fix this added check for request completion and skip processing
if already completed and added the request status for ep0 while queue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68288 | usb: storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68288</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport

A kernel memory leak was identified by the 'ioctl_sg01' test from Linux
Test Project (LTP). The following bytes were mainly observed: 0x53425355.

When USB storage devices incorrectly skip the data phase with status data,
the code extracts/validates the CSW from the sg buffer, but fails to clear
it afterwards. This leaves status protocol data in srb's transfer buffer,
such as the US_BULK_CS_SIGN 'USBS' signature observed here. Thus, this can
lead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*)
interfaces, such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.

Fix the leak by zeroing the CSW data in srb's transfer buffer immediately
after the validation of devices that skip data phase.

Note: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero-
ing pages at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB
protocol data is written to already-allocated sg pages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68289 | usb: gadget: f_eem: Fix memory leak in eem_unwrap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68289</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The existing code did not handle the failure case of usb_ep_queue in the
command path, potentially leading to memory leaks.

Improve error handling to free all allocated resources on usb_ep_queue
failure. This patch continues to use goto logic for error handling, as the
existing error handling is complex and not easily adaptable to auto-cleanup
helpers.

mm/memfd: fix information leak in hugetlb folios

When allocating hugetlb folios for memfd, three initialization steps are
missing:

1. Folios are not zeroed, leading to kernel memory disclosure to userspace
2. Folios are not marked uptodate before adding to page cache
3. hugetlb_fault_mutex is not taken before hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()

The memfd allocation path bypasses the normal page fault handler
(hugetlb_no_page) which would handle all of these initialization steps. 
This is problematic especially for udmabuf use cases where folios are
pinned and directly accessed by userspace via DMA.

Fix by matching the initialization pattern used in hugetlb_no_page():
- Zero the folio using folio_zero_user() which is optimized for huge pages
- Mark it uptodate with folio_mark_uptodate()
- Take hugetlb_fault_mutex before adding to page cache to prevent races

The folio_zero_user() change also fixes a potential security issue where
uninitialized kernel memory could be disclosed to userspace through read()
or mmap() operations on the memfd.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68293 | mm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68293</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio

Commit c010d47f107f ("mm: thp: split huge page to any lower order pages")
introduced an early check on the folio's order via mapping-&gt;flags before
proceeding with the split work.

This check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the swap cache and
truncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing
mapping-&gt;flags in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.

This commit fixes the issue by moving the check for mapping != NULL before
any attempt to access mapping-&gt;flags.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68294 | io_uring/net: ensure vectored buffer node import is tied to notification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68294</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm, fbcon, vga_switcheroo: Avoid race condition in fbcon setup

Protect vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() with console lock. Avoids OOB
access in fbcon_remap_all(). Without holding the console lock the call
races with switching outputs.

VGA switcheroo calls fbcon_remap_all() when switching clients. The fbcon
function uses struct fb_info.node, which is set by register_framebuffer().
As the fb-helper code currently sets up VGA switcheroo before registering
the framebuffer, the value of node is -1 and therefore not a legal value.
For example, fbcon uses the value within set_con2fb_map() [1] as an index
into an array.

Moving vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() after register_framebuffer() can
result in VGA switching that does not switch fbcon correctly.

Therefore move vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() under fbcon_fb_registered(),
which already holds the console lock. Fbdev calls fbcon_fb_registered()
from within register_framebuffer(). Serializes the helper with VGA
switcheroo's call to fbcon_remap_all().

Although vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() takes an instance of struct fb_info
as parameter, it really only needs the contained fbcon state. Moving the
call to fbcon initialization is therefore cleaner than before. Only amdgpu,
i915, nouveau and radeon support vga_switcheroo. For all other drivers,
this change does nothing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68297 | ceph: fix crash in process_v2_sparse_read() for encrypted directories</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68297</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Avoid btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() NULL deref

In btusb_mtk_setup(), we set `btmtk_data-&gt;isopkt_intf` to:
  usb_ifnum_to_if(data-&gt;udev, MTK_ISO_IFNUM)

That function can return NULL in some cases. Even when it returns
NULL, though, we still go on to call btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf().

As of commit e9087e828827 ("Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for
usb_driver_claim_interface()"), calling btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf()
when `btmtk_data-&gt;isopkt_intf` is NULL will cause a crash because
we'll end up passing a bad pointer to device_lock(). Prior to that
commit we'd pass the NULL pointer directly to
usb_driver_claim_interface() which would detect it and return an
error, which was handled.

Resolve the crash in btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() by adding a NULL check
at the start of the function. This makes the code handle a NULL
`btmtk_data-&gt;isopkt_intf` the same way it did before the problematic
commit (just with a slight change to the error message printed).</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68299 | afs: Fix delayed allocation of a cell&amp;#x27;s anonymous key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68299</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix delayed allocation of a cell's anonymous key

The allocation of a cell's anonymous key is done in a background thread
along with other cell setup such as doing a DNS upcall.  In the reported
bug, this is triggered by afs_parse_source() parsing the device name given
to mount() and calling afs_lookup_cell() with the name of the cell.

The normal key lookup then tries to use the key description on the
anonymous authentication key as the reference for request_key() - but it
may not yet be set and so an oops can happen.

This has been made more likely to happen by the fix for dynamic lookup
failure.

Fix this by firstly allocating a reference name and attaching it to the
afs_cell record when the record is created.  It can share the memory
allocation with the cell name (unfortunately it can't just overlap the cell
name by prepending it with "afs@" as the cell name already has a '.'
prepended for other purposes).  This reference name is then passed to
request_key().

Secondly, the anon key is now allocated on demand at the point a key is
requested in afs_request_key() if it is not already allocated.  A mutex is
used to prevent multiple allocation for a cell.

Thirdly, make afs_request_key_rcu() return NULL if the anonymous key isn't
yet allocated (if we need it) and then the caller can return -ECHILD to
drop out of RCU-mode and afs_request_key() can be called.

Note that the anonymous key is kind of necessary to make the key lookup
cache work as that doesn't currently cache a negative lookup, but it's
probably worth some investigation to see if NULL can be used instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68300 | fs/namespace: fix reference leak in grab_requested_mnt_ns</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68300</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: atlantic: fix fragment overflow handling in RX path

The atlantic driver can receive packets with more than MAX_SKB_FRAGS (17)
fragments when handling large multi-descriptor packets. This causes an
out-of-bounds write in skb_add_rx_frag_netmem() leading to kernel panic.

The issue occurs because the driver doesn't check the total number of
fragments before calling skb_add_rx_frag(). When a packet requires more
than MAX_SKB_FRAGS fragments, the fragment index exceeds the array bounds.

Fix by assuming there will be an extra frag if buff-&gt;len &gt; AQ_CFG_RX_HDR_SIZE,
then all fragments are accounted for. And reusing the existing check to
prevent the overflow earlier in the code path.

This crash occurred in production with an Aquantia AQC113 10G NIC.

net: sxgbe: fix potential NULL dereference in sxgbe_rx()

Currently, when skb is null, the driver prints an error and then
dereferences skb on the next line.

To fix this, let's add a 'break' after the error message to switch
to sxgbe_rx_refill(), which is similar to the approach taken by the
other drivers in this particular case, e.g. calxeda with xgmac_rx().

Bluetooth: hci_core: lookup hci_conn on RX path on protocol side

The hdev lock/lookup/unlock/use pattern in the packet RX path doesn't
ensure hci_conn* is not concurrently modified/deleted. This locking
appears to be leftover from before conn_hash started using RCU
commit bf4c63252490b ("Bluetooth: convert conn hash to RCU")
and not clear if it had purpose since then.

Currently, there are code paths that delete hci_conn* from elsewhere
than the ordered hdev-&gt;workqueue where the RX work runs in. E.g.
commit 5af1f84ed13a ("Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF on hci_abort_conn_sync")
introduced some of these, and there probably were a few others before
it.  It's better to do the locking so that even if these run
concurrently no UAF is possible.

Move the lookup of hci_conn and associated socket-specific conn to
protocol recv handlers, and do them within a single critical section
to cover hci_conn* usage and lookup.

can: kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers

The `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback`
functions contain logic to zero-length commands. These commands are used
to align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.

The driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer
position `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.

However, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary
(i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`
function will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`
to be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.

This patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.
This ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is
based on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next
aligned boundary.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:19:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68281 | ASoC: SDCA: bug fix while parsing mipi-sdca-control-cn-list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68281</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length
byte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after

frame can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing
the parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results
in out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.

Fix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit
before accepting the IE or advancing to the next element.

This prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates safely on

comedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls

Syzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel, seemingly due to
unexistent callback dev-&gt;get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should
not occur as said callback must always be set to
get_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().

As the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least,
judging from [1] reports, the blame lies with compat versions
of standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified and
do not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these
ioctls essentially copy their original versions, they do not
have required sanity check for device's attached status. This,
in turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a
device that has not been properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.

Doing so on unconfigured devices means that several crucial steps
are missed, for instance, specifying dev-&gt;get_valid_routes()
callback.

Fix this somewhat crudely by ensuring device's attached status before
performing any ioctls, improving logic consistency between modern
and compat functions.

comedi: multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach() that induces a
task timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations,
specifically, in the case of multiq3 driver.

This problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration
options used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice.
If a particularly great number is passed to s-&gt;n_chan in
multiq3_attach() via it-&gt;options[2], then multiple calls to
multiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method
will be running for minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices
as well.

While this issue is most likely not too dangerous for real-life
devices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs. Enable
a sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each
with 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.

KVM: SVM: Don't skip unrelated instruction if INT3/INTO is replaced

When re-injecting a soft interrupt from an INT3, INT0, or (select) INTn
instruction, discard the exception and retry the instruction if the code
stream is changed (e.g. by a different vCPU) between when the CPU
executes the instruction and when KVM decodes the instruction to get the
next RIP.

As effectively predicted by commit 6ef88d6e36c2 ("KVM: SVM: Re-inject
INT3/INTO instead of retrying the instruction"), failure to verify that
the correct INTn instruction was decoded can effectively clobber guest
state due to decoding the wrong instruction and thus specifying the
wrong next RIP.

The bug most often manifests as "Oops: int3" panics on static branch
checks in Linux guests.  Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux
uses the kernel's "text poke" code patching mechanism.  To modify code
while other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)
replaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode
0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,
and finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code
stream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being
modified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to
handle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is
incorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.

The bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to
repeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on
the host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.

rust_binder: fix race condition on death_list

Rust Binder contains the following unsafe operation:

	// SAFETY: A `NodeDeath` is never inserted into the death list
	// of any node other than its owner, so it is either in this
	// death list or in no death list.
	unsafe { node_inner.death_list.remove(self) };

This operation is unsafe because when touching the prev/next pointers of
a list element, we have to ensure that no other thread is also touching
them in parallel. If the node is present in the list that `remove` is
called on, then that is fine because we have exclusive access to that
list. If the node is not in any list, then it's also ok. But if it's
present in a different list that may be accessed in parallel, then that
may be a data race on the prev/next pointers.

And unfortunately that is exactly what is happening here. In
Node::release, we:

 1. Take the lock.
 2. Move all items to a local list on the stack.
 3. Drop the lock.
 4. Iterate the local list on the stack.

Combined with threads using the unsafe remove method on the original
list, this leads to memory corruption of the prev/next pointers. This
leads to crashes like this one:

Fix a race between inline data destruction and block mapping.

The function ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() changes the inode data

crypto: zstd - fix double-free in per-CPU stream cleanup

The crypto/zstd module has a double-free bug that occurs when multiple
tfms are allocated and freed.

The issue happens because zstd_streams (per-CPU contexts) are freed in
zstd_exit() during every tfm destruction, rather than being managed at
the module level.  When multiple tfms exist, each tfm exit attempts to
free the same shared per-CPU streams, resulting in a double-free.

This leads to a stack trace similar to:

ksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request

ipc_msg_send_request() waits for a generic netlink reply using an
ipc_msg_table_entry on the stack. The generic netlink handler
(handle_generic_event()/handle_response()) fills entry-&gt;response under
ipc_msg_table_lock, but ipc_msg_send_request() used to validate and free
entry-&gt;response without holding the same lock.

Under high concurrency this allows a race where handle_response() is
copying data into entry-&gt;response while ipc_msg_send_request() has just
freed it, leading to a slab-use-after-free reported by KASAN in
handle_generic_event():

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in handle_generic_event+0x3c4/0x5f0 [ksmbd]

  Freed by task:
    kvfree
    ipc_msg_send_request [ksmbd]
    ksmbd_rpc_open -&gt; ksmbd_session_rpc_open [ksmbd]

Fix by:
- Taking ipc_msg_table_lock in ipc_msg_send_request() while validating
  entry-&gt;response, freeing it when invalid, and removing the entry from
  ipc_msg_table.
- Returning the final entry-&gt;response pointer to the caller only after
  the hash entry is removed under the lock.
- Returning NULL in the error path, preserving the original API
  semantics.

This makes all accesses to entry-&gt;response consistent with
handle_response(), which already updates and fills the response buffer
under ipc_msg_table_lock, and closes the race that allowed the UAF.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:55:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68264 | ext4: refresh inline data size before write operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68264</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: refresh inline data size before write operations

The cached ei-&gt;i_inline_size can become stale between the initial size
check and when ext4_update_inline_data()/ext4_create_inline_data() use
it. Although ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads the correct value at the
time of the check, concurrent xattr operations can modify i_inline_size
before ext4_write_lock_xattr() is acquired.

This causes ext4_update_inline_data() and ext4_create_inline_data() to
work with stale capacity values, leading to a BUG_ON() crash in
ext4_write_inline_data():

  kernel BUG at fs/ext4/inline.c:1331!
  BUG_ON(pos + len &gt; EXT4_I(inode)-&gt;i_inline_size);

The race window:
1. ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads i_inline_size = 60 (correct)
2. Size check passes for 50-byte write
3. [Another thread adds xattr, i_inline_size changes to 40]
4. ext4_write_lock_xattr() acquires lock
5. ext4_update_inline_data() uses stale i_inline_size = 60
6. Attempts to write 50 bytes but only 40 bytes actually available
7. BUG_ON() triggers

Fix this by recalculating i_inline_size via ext4_find_inline_data_nolock()
immediately after acquiring xattr_sem. This ensures ext4_update_inline_data()
and ext4_create_inline_data() work with current values that are protected
from concurrent modifications.

This is similar to commit a54c4613dac1 ("ext4: fix race writing to an
inline_data file while its xattrs are changing") which fixed i_inline_off
staleness. This patch addresses the related i_inline_size staleness issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:55:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68265 | nvme: fix admin request_queue lifetime</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68265</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode-&gt;i_mode can become bogus when
the S_IFMT bits of the 32bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted
or when the 32bits "attributes" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

A documentation says that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the "mode" field.
But I can't find an explicit explanation that the unused upper 23 bits
(especially, the S_IFMT bits) are initialized with 0.

Therefore, ignore the S_IFMT bits of the "mode" field loaded from disk.
Also, verify that the value of the "attributes" field loaded from disk is
either BFS_VREG or BFS_VDIR (because BFS supports only regular files and
the root directory).</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:55:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68239 | binfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68239</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()

bm_register_write() opens an executable file using open_exec(), which
internally calls do_open_execat() and denies write access on the file to
avoid modification while it is being executed.

However, when an error occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using
filp_close() directly. This does not restore the write permission, which
may cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.

Fix this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to
restore the write permission properly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68240 | nilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68240</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci

Because kthread_stop did not stop sc_task properly and returned -EINTR,
the sc_timer was not properly closed, ultimately causing the problem [1]
reported by syzbot when freeing sci due to the sc_timer not being closed.

Because the thread sc_task main function nilfs_segctor_thread() returns 0
when it succeeds, when the return value of kthread_stop() is not 0 in
nilfs_segctor_destroy(), we believe that it has not properly closed
sc_timer.

We use timer_shutdown_sync() to sync wait for sc_timer to shutdown, and
set the value of sc_task to NULL under the protection of lock
sc_state_lock, so as to avoid the issue caused by sc_timer not being
properly shutdowned.

ipv4: route: Prevent rt_bind_exception() from rebinding stale fnhe

The sit driver's packet transmission path calls: sit_tunnel_xmit() -&gt;
update_or_create_fnhe(), which lead to fnhe_remove_oldest() being called
to delete entries exceeding FNHE_RECLAIM_DEPTH+random.

The race window is between fnhe_remove_oldest() selecting fnheX for
deletion and the subsequent kfree_rcu(). During this time, the
concurrent path's __mkroute_output() -&gt; find_exception() can fetch the
soon-to-be-deleted fnheX, and rt_bind_exception() then binds it with a
new dst using a dst_hold(). When the original fnheX is freed via RCU,
the dst reference remains permanently leaked.

This issue manifests as a device reference count leak and a warning in
dmesg when unregistering the net device:

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sitX to become free. Usage count = N

Ido Schimmel provided the simple test validation method [1].

The fix clears 'oldest-&gt;fnhe_daddr' before calling fnhe_flush_routes().
Since rt_bind_exception() checks this field, setting it to zero prevents
the stale fnhe from being reused and bound to a new dst just before it
is freed.

NFS: Fix LTP test failures when timestamps are delegated

The utimes01 and utime06 tests fail when delegated timestamps are
enabled, specifically in subtests that modify the atime and mtime
fields using the 'nobody' user ID.

The problem can be reproduced as follow:

# echo "/media *(rw,no_root_squash,sync)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports
# export -ra
# mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.2 127.0.0.1:/media /tmpdir
# cd /opt/ltp
# ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utimes01
# ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utime06

This issue occurs because nfs_setattr does not verify the inode's
UID against the caller's fsuid when delegated timestamps are
permitted for the inode.

This patch adds the UID check and if it does not match then the
request is sent to the server for permission checking.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:56:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68243 | NFS: Check the TLS certificate fields in nfs_match_client()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68243</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup

commit efa95b01da18 ("netpoll: fix use after free") incorrectly
ignored the refcount and prematurely set dev-&gt;npinfo to NULL during
netpoll cleanup, leading to improper behavior and memory leaks.

Scenario causing lack of proper cleanup:

1) A netpoll is associated with a NIC (e.g., eth0) and netdev-&gt;npinfo is
   allocated, and refcnt = 1
   - Keep in mind that npinfo is shared among all netpoll instances. In
     this case, there is just one.

2) Another netpoll is also associated with the same NIC and
   npinfo-&gt;refcnt += 1.
   - Now dev-&gt;npinfo-&gt;refcnt = 2;
   - There is just one npinfo associated to the netdev.

3) When the first netpolls goes to clean up:
   - The first cleanup succeeds and clears np-&gt;dev-&gt;npinfo, ignoring
     refcnt.
     - It basically calls `RCU_INIT_POINTER(np-&gt;dev-&gt;npinfo, NULL);`
   - Set dev-&gt;npinfo = NULL, without proper cleanup
   - No -&gt;ndo_netpoll_cleanup() is either called

4) Now the second target tries to clean up
   - The second cleanup fails because np-&gt;dev-&gt;npinfo is already NULL.
     * In this case, ops-&gt;ndo_netpoll_cleanup() was never called, and
       the skb pool is not cleaned as well (for the second netpoll
       instance)
  - This leaks npinfo and skbpool skbs, which is clearly reported by
    kmemleak.

Revert commit efa95b01da18 ("netpoll: fix use after free") and adds
clarifying comments emphasizing that npinfo cleanup should only happen
once the refcount reaches zero, ensuring stable and correct netpoll
behavior.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:56:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68246 | ksmbd: close accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68246</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmw_balloon: indicate success when effectively deflating during migration

When migrating a balloon page, we first deflate the old page to then
inflate the new page.

However, if inflating the new page succeeded, we effectively deflated the
old page, reducing the balloon size.

In that case, the migration actually worked: similar to migrating+
immediately deflating the new page.  The old page will be freed back to
the buddy.

Right now, the core will leave the page be marked as isolated (as we
returned an error).  When later trying to putback that page, we will run
into the WARN_ON_ONCE() in balloon_page_putback().

That handling was changed in commit 3544c4faccb8 ("mm/balloon_compaction:
stop using __ClearPageMovable()"); before that change, we would have
tolerated that way of handling it.

To fix it, let's just return 0 in that case, making the core effectively
just clear the "isolated" flag + freeing it back to the buddy as if the
migration succeeded.  Note that the new page will also get freed when the
core puts the last reference.

Note that this also makes it all be more consistent: we will no longer
unisolate the page in the balloon driver while keeping it marked as being
isolated in migration core.

This was found by code inspection.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:56:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68249 | most: usb: hdm_probe: Fix calling put_device() before device initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68249</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

most: usb: hdm_probe: Fix calling put_device() before device initialization

The early error path in hdm_probe() can jump to err_free_mdev before

put_device(&amp;amp;mdev-&gt;dev) there triggers a device core WARN and ends up
invoking kref_put(&amp;amp;kobj-&gt;kref, kobject_release) on an uninitialized
kobject.

In this path the private struct was only kmalloc'ed and the intended
release is effectively kfree(mdev) anyway, so free it directly instead
of calling put_device() on an uninitialized device.

This removes the WARNING and fixes the pre-initialization error path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:56:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68250 | hung_task: fix warnings caused by unaligned lock pointers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68250</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hung_task: fix warnings caused by unaligned lock pointers

The blocker tracking mechanism assumes that lock pointers are at least
4-byte aligned to use their lower bits for type encoding.

However, as reported by Eero Tamminen, some architectures like m68k
only guarantee 2-byte alignment of 32-bit values. This breaks the
assumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.

To fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock
that is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such
cases and avoiding the related warnings.

veth: more robust handing of race to avoid txq getting stuck

Commit dc82a33297fc ("veth: apply qdisc backpressure on full ptr_ring to
reduce TX drops") introduced a race condition that can lead to a permanently
stalled TXQ. This was observed in production on ARM64 systems (Ampere Altra
Max).

The race occurs in veth_xmit(). The producer observes a full ptr_ring and
stops the queue (netif_tx_stop_queue()). The subsequent conditional logic,
intended to re-wake the queue if the consumer had just emptied it (if
(__ptr_ring_empty(...)) netif_tx_wake_queue()), can fail. This leads to a
"lost wakeup" where the TXQ remains stopped (QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF) and
traffic halts.

This failure is caused by an incorrect use of the __ptr_ring_empty() API
from the producer side. As noted in kernel comments, this check is not
guaranteed to be correct if a consumer is operating on another CPU. The
empty test is based on ptr_ring-&gt;consumer_head, making it reliable only for
the consumer. Using this check from the producer side is fundamentally racy.

This patch fixes the race by adopting the more robust logic from an earlier
version V4 of the patchset, which always flushed the peer:

(1) In veth_xmit(), the racy conditional wake-up logic and its memory barrier
are removed. Instead, after stopping the queue, we unconditionally call
__veth_xdp_flush(rq). This guarantees that the NAPI consumer is scheduled,
making it solely responsible for re-waking the TXQ.
  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets and completes
NAPI *before* veth_xmit() on the producer side has called netif_tx_stop_queue.
The __veth_xdp_flush(rq) will observe rx_notify_masked is false and schedule
NAPI.

(2) On the consumer side, the logic for waking the peer TXQ is moved out of
veth_xdp_rcv() and placed at the end of the veth_poll() function. This
placement is part of fixing the race, as the netif_tx_queue_stopped() check
must occur after rx_notify_masked is potentially set to false during NAPI
completion.
  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets, but haven't
finished (rx_notify_masked is still true). The producer veth_xmit() stops the

scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)

According to UFS specifications, the power-off sequence for a UFS device
includes:

 - Sending an SSU command with Power_Condition=3 and await a response.

 - Asserting RST_N low.

 - Turning off REF_CLK.

 - Turning off VCC.

 - Turning off VCCQ/VCCQ2.

As part of ufs shutdown, after the SSU command completion, asserting
hardware reset (HWRST) triggers the device firmware to wake up and
execute its reset routine. This routine initializes hardware blocks and
takes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a
large current.

This large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is
supplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to
the regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power
mode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework
because UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if
the rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM
current thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this
state, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the
regulator.

To prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This
allows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active
and in high-power mode.

Currently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is
completed or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with
Qualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS vendors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:35:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68237 | mtdchar: fix integer overflow in read/write ioctls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68237</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtdchar: fix integer overflow in read/write ioctls

The "req.start" and "req.len" variables are u64 values that come from the
user at the start of the function.  We mask away the high 32 bits of
"req.len" so that's capped at U32_MAX but the "req.start" variable can go
up to U64_MAX which means that the addition can still integer overflow.

crash: fix crashkernel resource shrink

When crashkernel is configured with a high reservation, shrinking its
value below the low crashkernel reservation causes two issues:

1. Invalid crashkernel resource objects
2. Kernel crash if crashkernel shrinking is done twice

For example, with crashkernel=200M,high, the kernel reserves 200MB of high
memory and some default low memory (say 256MB).  The reservation appears
as:

cat /proc/iomem | grep -i crash
af000000-beffffff : Crash kernel
433000000-43f7fffff : Crash kernel

If crashkernel is then shrunk to 50MB (echo 52428800 &gt;
/sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size), /proc/iomem still shows 256MB reserved:
af000000-beffffff : Crash kernel

Instead, it should show 50MB:
af000000-b21fffff : Crash kernel

Further shrinking crashkernel to 40MB causes a kernel crash with the
following trace (x86):

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038

This happens because __crash_shrink_memory()/kernel/crash_core.c

when shrinking crashkernel memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68199 | codetag: debug: handle existing CODETAG_EMPTY in mark_objexts_empty for slabobj_ext</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68199</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

codetag: debug: handle existing CODETAG_EMPTY in mark_objexts_empty for slabobj_ext

When alloc_slab_obj_exts() fails and then later succeeds in allocating a
slab extension vector, it calls handle_failed_objexts_alloc() to mark all
objects in the vector as empty.  As a result all objects in this slab
(slabA) will have their extensions set to CODETAG_EMPTY.

Later on if this slabA is used to allocate a slabobj_ext vector for
another slab (slabB), we end up with the slabB-&gt;obj_exts pointing to a
slabobj_ext vector that itself has a non-NULL slabobj_ext equal to
CODETAG_EMPTY.  When slabB gets freed, free_slab_obj_exts() is called to
free slabB-&gt;obj_exts vector.  

free_slab_obj_exts() calls mark_objexts_empty(slabB-&gt;obj_exts) which will
generate a warning because it expects slabobj_ext vectors to have a NULL
obj_ext, not CODETAG_EMPTY.

Modify mark_objexts_empty() to skip the warning and setting the obj_ext
value if it's already set to CODETAG_EMPTY.


To quickly detect this WARN, I modified the code from
WARN_ON(slab_exts[offs].ref.ct) to BUG_ON(slab_exts[offs].ref.ct == 1);

We then obtained this message:

drm/amdgpu: fix lock warning in amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process

Fix a potential deadlock caused by inconsistent spinlock usage
between interrupt and process contexts in the userq fence driver.

The issue occurs when amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process() is called
from both:
- Interrupt context: gfx_v11_0_eop_irq() -&gt; amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()
- Process context: amdgpu_eviction_fence_suspend_worker() -&gt;
  amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_force_completion() -&gt; amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()

In interrupt context, the spinlock was acquired without disabling
interrupts, leaving it in {IN-HARDIRQ-W} state. When the same lock
is acquired in process context, the kernel detects inconsistent
locking since the process context acquisition would enable interrupts
while holding a lock previously acquired in interrupt context.

Kernel log shows:

ALSA: hda/hdmi: Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver

After restructuring and splitting the HDMI codec driver code, each
HDMI codec driver contains the own build_controls and build_pcms ops.
A copy-n-paste error put the wrong entries for nvhdmi-mcp driver; both
build_controls and build_pcms are swapped.  Unfortunately both
callbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn't complain
it, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM
instance hasn't been initialized at calling the build_controls
callback.

Fix it by passing the proper entries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68206 | netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68206</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections

Sequence adjustment may be required for FTP traffic with PASV/EPSV modes.
due to need to re-write packet payload (IP, port) on the ftp control
connection. This can require changes to the TCP length and expected
seq / ack_seq.

The easiest way to reproduce this issue is with PASV mode.
Example ruleset:
table inet ftp_nat {
        ct helper ftp_helper {
                type "ftp" protocol tcp
                l3proto inet
        }

        chain prerouting {
                type filter hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 ct state new ct helper set "ftp_helper"
        }
}
table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
                type nat hook prerouting priority -100; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 dnat ip prefix to ip daddr map {
			192.168.100.1 : 192.168.13.2/32 }
        }

        chain postrouting {
                type nat hook postrouting priority 100 ; policy accept;
                tcp sport 21 snat ip prefix to ip saddr map {
			192.168.13.2 : 192.168.100.1/32 }
        }
}

Note that the ftp helper gets assigned *after* the dnat setup.

The inverse (nat after helper assign) is handled by an existing
check in nf_nat_setup_info() and will not show the problem.

bpf: account for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()

The usage pattern for widen_imprecise_scalars() looks as follows:

    prev_st = find_prev_entry(env, ...);
    queued_st = push_stack(...);
    widen_imprecise_scalars(env, prev_st, queued_st);

Where prev_st is an ancestor of the queued_st in the explored states
tree. This ancestor is not guaranteed to have same allocated stack
depth as queued_st. E.g. in the following case:

    def main():
      for i in 1..2:
        foo(i)        // same callsite, differnt param

    def foo(i):
      if i == 1:
        use 128 bytes of stack
      iterator based loop

Here, for a second 'foo' call prev_st-&gt;allocated_stack is 128,
while queued_st-&gt;allocated_stack is much smaller.
widen_imprecise_scalars() needs to take this into account and avoid
accessing bpf_verifier_state-&gt;frame[*]-&gt;stack out of bounds.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68209 | mlx5: Fix default values in create CQ</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68209</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlx5: Fix default values in create CQ

Currently, CQs without a completion function are assigned the
mlx5_add_cq_to_tasklet function by default. This is problematic since
only user CQs created through the mlx5_ib driver are intended to use
this function.

Additionally, all CQs that will use doorbells instead of polling for
completions must call mlx5_cq_arm. However, the default CQ creation flow
leaves a valid value in the CQ's arm_db field, allowing FW to send
interrupts to polling-only CQs in certain corner cases.

These two factors would allow a polling-only kernel CQ to be triggered
by an EQ interrupt and call a completion function intended only for user
CQs, causing a null pointer exception.

Some areas in the driver have prevented this issue with one-off fixes
but did not address the root cause.

This patch fixes the described issue by adding defaults to the create CQ
flow. It adds a default dummy completion function to protect against
null pointer exceptions, and it sets an invalid command sequence number
by default in kernel CQs to prevent the FW from sending an interrupt to
the CQ until it is armed. User CQs are responsible for their own
initialization values.

Callers of mlx5_core_create_cq are responsible for changing the
completion function and arming the CQ per their needs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68210 | erofs: avoid infinite loop due to incomplete zstd-compressed data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68210</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksm: use range-walk function to jump over holes in scan_get_next_rmap_item

Currently, scan_get_next_rmap_item() walks every page address in a VMA to
locate mergeable pages.  This becomes highly inefficient when scanning
large virtual memory areas that contain mostly unmapped regions, causing
ksmd to use large amount of cpu without deduplicating much pages.

This patch replaces the per-address lookup with a range walk using
walk_page_range().  The range walker allows KSM to skip over entire
unmapped holes in a VMA, avoiding unnecessary lookups.  This problem was
previously discussed in [1].

Consider the following test program which creates a 32 TiB mapping in the
virtual address space but only populates a single page:

#include 
#include 
#include mman.h&gt;

* 32 TiB */
const size_t size = 32ul * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;

int main() {
        char *area = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                          MAP_NORESERVE | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON, -1, 0);

        if (area == MAP_FAILED) {
                perror("mmap() failed\n");
                return -1;
        }

        /* Populate a single page such that we get an anon_vma. */
        *area = 0;

        /* Enable KSM. */
        madvise(area, size, MADV_MERGEABLE);
        pause();
        return 0;
}

$ ./ksm-sparse  &amp;
$ echo 1 &gt; /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run 

Without this patch ksmd uses 100% of the cpu for a long time (more then 1
hour in my test machine) scanning all the 32 TiB virtual address space
that contain only one mapped page.  This makes ksmd essentially deadlocked
not able to deduplicate anything of value.  With this patch ksmd walks
only the one mapped page and skips the rest of the 32 TiB virtual address
space, making the scan fast using little cpu.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68212 | fs: Fix uninitialized &amp;#x27;offp&amp;#x27; in statmount_string()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68212</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

timers: Fix NULL function pointer race in timer_shutdown_sync()

There is a race condition between timer_shutdown_sync() and timer
expiration that can lead to hitting a WARN_ON in expire_timers().

The issue occurs when timer_shutdown_sync() clears the timer function
to NULL while the timer is still running on another CPU. The race
scenario looks like this:

CPU0					CPU1
					
					lock_timer_base()
					expire_timers()
					base-&gt;running_timer = timer;
					unlock_timer_base()
					[call_timer_fn enter]
					mod_timer()
					...
timer_shutdown_sync()
lock_timer_base()
// For now, will not detach the timer but only clear its function to NULL
if (base-&gt;running_timer != timer)
	ret = detach_if_pending(timer, base, true);
if (shutdown)
	timer-&gt;function = NULL;
unlock_timer_base()
					[call_timer_fn exit]
					lock_timer_base()
					base-&gt;running_timer = NULL;
					unlock_timer_base()
					...
					// Now timer is pending while its function set to NULL.
					// next timer trigger
					
					expire_timers()
					WARN_ON_ONCE(!fn) // hit
					...
lock_timer_base()
// Now timer will detach
if (base-&gt;running_timer != timer)
	ret = detach_if_pending(timer, base, true);
if (shutdown)
	timer-&gt;function = NULL;
unlock_timer_base()

The problem is that timer_shutdown_sync() clears the timer function
regardless of whether the timer is currently running. This can leave a
pending timer with a NULL function pointer, which triggers the
WARN_ON_ONCE(!fn) check in expire_timers().

Fix this by only clearing the timer function when actually detaching the
timer. If the timer is running, leave the function pointer intact, which is
safe because the timer will be properly detached when it finishes running.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68215 | ice: fix PTP cleanup on driver removal in error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: BPF: Disable trampoline for kernel module function trace

The current LoongArch BPF trampoline implementation is incompatible
with tracing functions in kernel modules. This causes several severe
and user-visible problems:

* The `bpf_selftests/module_attach` test fails consistently.
* Kernel lockup when a BPF program is attached to a module function [1].
* Critical kernel modules like WireGuard experience traffic disruption
  when their functions are traced with fentry [2].

Given the severity and the potential for other unknown side-effects, it
is safest to disable the feature entirely for now. This patch prevents
the BPF subsystem from allowing trampoline attachments to kernel module
functions on LoongArch.

This is a temporary mitigation until the core issues in the trampoline
code for kernel module handling can be identified and fixed.

Input: pegasus-notetaker - fix potential out-of-bounds access

In the pegasus_notetaker driver, the pegasus_probe() function allocates
the URB transfer buffer using the wMaxPacketSize value from
the endpoint descriptor. An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor
to force the allocation of a very small buffer.

Subsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific
pattern (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42),
the pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the packet without checking
the allocated buffer size.

cifs: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param error path

Add proper cleanup of ctx-&gt;source and fc-&gt;source to the
cifs_parse_mount_err error handler. This ensures that memory allocated
for the source strings is correctly freed on all error paths, matching
the cleanup already performed in the success path by
smb3_cleanup_fs_context_contents().
Pointers are also set to NULL after freeing to prevent potential
double-free issues.

This change fixes a memory leak originally detected by syzbot. The
leak occurred when processing Opt_source mount options if an error
happened after ctx-&gt;source and fc-&gt;source were successfully
allocated but before the function completed.

The specific leak sequence was:
1. ctx-&gt;source = smb3_fs_context_fullpath(ctx, '/') allocates memory
2. fc-&gt;source = kstrdup(ctx-&gt;source, GFP_KERNEL) allocates more memory
3. A subsequent error jumps to cifs_parse_mount_err
4. The old error handler freed passwords but not the source strings,
causing the memory to leak.

This issue was not addressed by commit e8c73eb7db0a ("cifs: client:

net: ethernet: ti: netcp: Standardize knav_dma_open_channel to return NULL on error

Make knav_dma_open_channel consistently return NULL on error instead
of ERR_PTR. Currently the header include/linux/soc/ti/knav_dma.h
returns NULL when the driver is disabled, but the driver
implementation does not even return NULL or ERR_PTR on failure,
causing inconsistency in the users. This results in a crash in
netcp_free_navigator_resources as followed (trimmed):

Standardize the error handling by making the function return NULL on

drm/radeon: delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock

Delete the attempt to progress the queue when checking if fence is
signaled. This avoids deadlock.

dma-fence_ops::signaled can be called with the fence lock in unknown
state. For radeon, the fence lock is also the wait queue lock. This can
cause a self deadlock when signaled() tries to make forward progress on
the wait queue. But advancing the queue is unneeded because incorrectly
returning false from signaled() is perfectly acceptable.

Fix this regression by making scsi_host_busy() check whether the SCSI
host tag set has already been initialized. tag_set-&gt;ops is set by
scsi_mq_setup_tags() just before blk_mq_alloc_tag_set() is called. This
fix is based on the assumption that scsi_host_busy() and
scsi_mq_setup_tags() calls are serialized. This is the case in the UFS

mptcp: Fix proto fallback detection with BPF

The sockmap feature allows bpf syscall from userspace, or based
on bpf sockops, replacing the sk_prot of sockets during protocol stack
processing with sockmap's custom read/write interfaces.
'''
tcp_rcv_state_process()
  syn_recv_sock()/subflow_syn_recv_sock()
    tcp_init_transfer(BPF_SOCK_OPS_PASSIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB)
      bpf_skops_established       &lt;== sockops
        bpf_sock_map_update(sk)   &lt;== call bpf helper
          tcp_bpf_update_proto()  &lt;== update sk_prot
'''

When the server has MPTCP enabled but the client sends a TCP SYN
without MPTCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock() performs a fallback on the
subflow, replacing the subflow sk's sk_prot with the native sk_prot.
'''
subflow_syn_recv_sock()
  subflow_ulp_fallback()
    subflow_drop_ctx()
      mptcp_subflow_ops_undo_override()
'''

Then, this subflow can be normally used by sockmap, which replaces the
native sk_prot with sockmap's custom sk_prot. The issue occurs when the
user executes accept::mptcp_stream_accept::mptcp_fallback_tcp_ops().
Here, it uses sk-&gt;sk_prot to compare with the native sk_prot, but this
is incorrect when sockmap is used, as we may incorrectly set
sk-&gt;sk_socket-&gt;ops.

This fix uses the more generic sk_family for the comparison instead.

Additionally, this also prevents a WARNING from occurring:

drm/amdgpu: fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough

On PF passthrough environment, after hibernate and then resume, coralgemm
will cause gpu page fault.

Mode1 reset happens during hibernate, but partition mode is not restored
on resume, register mmCP_HYP_XCP_CTL and mmCP_PSP_XCP_CTL is not right
after resume. When CP access the MQD BO, wrong stride size is used,
this will cause out of bound access on the MQD BO, resulting page fault.

The fix is to ensure gfx_v9_4_3_switch_compute_partition() is called
when resume from a hibernation.
KFD resume is called separately during a reset recovery or resume from
suspend sequence. Hence it's not required to be called as part of
partition switch.

Christoph found out this is due to the poisoning code not dealing
properly with CONFIG_HIGHMEM because only the first page is mapped but
then the whole potentially high-order page is accessed.

We could give up on HIGHMEM here, but it's straightforward to fix this
with a loop that's mapping, poisoning or checking and unmapping
individual pages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40358 | riscv: stacktrace: Disable KASAN checks for non-current tasks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40358</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix multifs mds auth caps issue

The mds auth caps check should also validate the
fsname along with the associated caps. Not doing
so would result in applying the mds auth caps of
one fs on to the other fs in a multifs ceph cluster.
The bug causes multiple issues w.r.t user
authentication, following is one such example.

Steps to Reproduce (on vstart cluster):
1. Create two file systems in a cluster, say 'fsname1' and 'fsname2'
2. Authorize read only permission to the user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname1'
    $ceph fs authorize fsname1 client.usr / r
3. Authorize read and write permission to the same user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname2'
    $ceph fs authorize fsname2 client.usr / rw
4. Update the keyring
    $ceph auth get client.usr &gt;&gt; ./keyring

With above permssions for the user 'client.usr', following is the
expectation.
  a. The 'client.usr' should be able to only read the contents
     and not allowed to create or delete files on file system 'fsname1'.
  b. The 'client.usr' should be able to read/write on file system 'fsname2'.

But, with this bug, the 'client.usr' is allowed to read/write on file
system 'fsname1'. See below.

5. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.usr'
     $sudo bin/mount.ceph usr@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_usr/
6. Try creating a file on file system 'fsname1' with user 'client.usr'. This
   should fail but passes with this bug.
     $touch /kmnt_fsname1_usr/file1
7. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.admin' and create a
   file.
     $sudo bin/mount.ceph admin@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_admin
     $echo "data" &gt; /kmnt_fsname1_admin/admin_file1
8. Try removing an existing file on file system 'fsname1' with the user
   'client.usr'. This shoudn't succeed but succeeds with the bug.
     $rm -f /kmnt_fsname1_usr/admin_file1

For more information, please take a look at the corresponding mds/fuse patch
and tests added by looking into the tracker mentioned below.

jfs: fix uninitialized waitqueue in transaction manager

The transaction manager initialization in txInit() was not properly
initializing TxBlock[0].waitor waitqueue, causing a crash when
txEnd(0) is called on read-only filesystems.

When a filesystem is mounted read-only, txBegin() returns tid=0 to
indicate no transaction. However, txEnd(0) still gets called and
tries to access TxBlock[0].waitor via tid_to_tblock(0), but this
waitqueue was never initialized because the initialization loop
started at index 1 instead of 0.

This causes a 'non-static key' lockdep warning and system crash:
  INFO: trying to register non-static key in txEnd

Fix by ensuring all transaction blocks including TxBlock[0] have
their waitqueues properly initialized during txInit().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68169 | netpoll: Fix deadlock in memory allocation under spinlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68169</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netpoll: Fix deadlock in memory allocation under spinlock

Fix a AA deadlock in refill_skbs() where memory allocation while holding
skb_pool-&gt;lock can trigger a recursive lock acquisition attempt.

The deadlock scenario occurs when the system is under severe memory
pressure:

1. refill_skbs() acquires skb_pool-&gt;lock (spinlock)
2. alloc_skb() is called while holding the lock
3. Memory allocator fails and calls slab_out_of_memory()
4. This triggers printk() for the OOM warning
5. The console output path calls netpoll_send_udp()
6. netpoll_send_udp() attempts to acquire the same skb_pool-&gt;lock
7. Deadlock: the lock is already held by the same CPU

Call stack:
  refill_skbs()
    spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;skb_pool-&gt;lock)    &lt;- lock acquired
    __alloc_skb()
      kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof()
        slab_out_of_memory()
          printk()
            console_flush_all()
              netpoll_send_udp()
                skb_dequeue()
                  spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;skb_pool-&gt;lock)     &lt;- deadlock attempt

This bug was exposed by commit 248f6571fd4c51 ("netpoll: Optimize skb
refilling on critical path") which removed refill_skbs() from the
critical path (where nested printk was being deferred), letting nested
printk being called from inside refill_skbs()

Refactor refill_skbs() to never allocate memory while holding
the spinlock.

Another possible solution to fix this problem is protecting the
refill_skbs() from nested printks, basically calling
printk_deferred_{enter,exit}() in refill_skbs(), then, any nested
pr_warn() would be deferred.

I prefer this approach, given I _think_ it might be a good idea to move
the alloc_skb() from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL in the future, so, having
the alloc_skb() outside of the lock will be necessary step.

There is a possible TOCTOU issue when checking for the pool length, and
queueing the new allocated skb, but, this is not an issue, given that
an extra SKB in the pool is harmless and it will be eventually used.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68170 | drm/radeon: Do not kfree() devres managed rdev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68170</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: Do not kfree() devres managed rdev

Since the allocation of the drivers main structure was changed to
devm_drm_dev_alloc() rdev is managed by devres and we shouldn't be calling
kfree() on it.

This fixes things exploding if the driver probe fails and devres cleans up
the rdev after we already free'd it.

x86/fpu: Ensure XFD state on signal delivery

Sean reported [1] the following splat when running KVM tests:

   WARNING: CPU: 232 PID: 15391 at xfd_validate_state+0x65/0x70
   Call Trace:
    
    fpu__clear_user_states+0x9c/0x100

    do_syscall_64+0x205/0x2c0
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

Chao further identified [2] a reproducible scenario involving signal
delivery: a non-AMX task is preempted by an AMX-enabled task which
modifies the XFD MSR.

When the non-AMX task resumes and reloads XSTATE with init values,
a warning is triggered due to a mismatch between fpstate::xfd and the
CPU's current XFD state. fpu__clear_user_states() does not currently
re-synchronize the XFD state after such preemption.

Invoke xfd_update_state() which detects and corrects the mismatch if
there is a dynamic feature.

This also benefits the sigreturn path, as fpu__restore_sig() may call
fpu__clear_user_states() when the sigframe is inaccessible.

amd/amdkfd: enhance kfd process check in switch partition

current switch partition only check if kfd_processes_table is empty.
kfd_prcesses_table entry is deleted in kfd_process_notifier_release, but
kfd_process tear down is in kfd_process_wq_release.

consider two processes:

Process A (workqueue) -&gt; kfd_process_wq_release -&gt; Access kfd_node member
Process B switch partition -&gt; amdgpu_xcp_pre_partition_switch -&gt; amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw
-&gt; kfd_node tear down.

Process A and B may trigger a race as shown in dmesg log.

This patch is to resolve the race by adding an atomic kfd_process counter
kfd_processes_count, it increment as create kfd process, decrement as
finish kfd_process_wq_release.

v2: Put kfd_processes_count per kfd_dev, move decrement to kfd_process_destroy_pdds
and bug fix. (Philip Yang)

media: nxp: imx8-isi: Fix streaming cleanup on release

The current implementation unconditionally calls
mxc_isi_video_cleanup_streaming() in mxc_isi_video_release(). This can
lead to situations where any release call (like from a simple
"v4l2-ctl -l") may release a currently streaming queue when called on
such a device.

This is reproducible on an i.MX8MP board by streaming from an ISI
capture device using gstreamer:

	gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/videoX ! \
	    video/x-raw,format=GRAY8,width=1280,height=800,framerate=1/120 ! \
	    fakesink

While this stream is running, querying the caps of the same device
provokes the error state:

	v4l2-ctl -l -d /dev/videoX

This results in the following trace:

Address this issue by moving the streaming preparation and cleanup to
the vb2 .prepare_streaming() and .unprepare_streaming() operations. This
also simplifies the driver by allowing direct usage of the
vb2_ioctl_streamon() and vb2_ioctl_streamoff() helpers, and removal of
the manual cleanup from mxc_isi_video_release().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68176 | PCI: cadence: Check for the existence of cdns_pcie::ops before using it</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68176</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: cadence: Check for the existence of cdns_pcie::ops before using it

cdns_pcie::ops might not be populated by all the Cadence glue drivers. This
is going to be true for the upcoming Sophgo platform which doesn't set the
ops.

Hence, add a check to prevent NULL pointer dereference.

cpufreq/longhaul: handle NULL policy in longhaul_exit

longhaul_exit() was calling cpufreq_cpu_get(0) without checking
for a NULL policy pointer. On some systems, this could lead to a
NULL dereference and a kernel warning or panic.

This patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early if the
policy is NULL.

Chain exists of:
  &amp;amp;q-&gt;sysfs_lock --&gt; &amp;amp;q-&gt;rq_qos_mutex --&gt; &amp;amp;q-&gt;q_usage_counter(queue)#3

 Possible unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&amp;amp;q-&gt;q_usage_counter(queue)#3);
                               lock(&amp;amp;q-&gt;rq_qos_mutex);
                               lock(&amp;amp;q-&gt;q_usage_counter(queue)#3);
  lock(&amp;amp;q-&gt;sysfs_lock);

Root cause is that queue_usage_counter is grabbed with rq_qos_mutex
held in blkg_conf_prep(), while queue should be freezed before
rq_qos_mutex from other context.

The blk_queue_enter() from blkg_conf_prep() is used to protect against
policy deactivation, which is already protected with blkcg_mutex, hence
convert blk_queue_enter() to blkcg_mutex to fix this problem. Meanwhile,
consider that blkcg_mutex is held after queue is freezed from policy
deactivation, also convert blkg_alloc() to use GFP_NOIO.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68179 | s390: Disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68179</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390: Disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP

As reported by Luiz Capitulino enabling HVO on s390 leads to reproducible
crashes. The problem is that kernel page tables are modified without
flushing corresponding TLB entries.

Even if it looks like the empty flush_tlb_all() implementation on s390 is
the problem, it is actually a different problem: on s390 it is not allowed
to replace an active/valid page table entry with another valid page table
entry without the detour over an invalid entry. A direct replacement may
lead to random crashes and/or data corruption.

In order to invalidate an entry special instructions have to be used
(e.g. ipte or idte). Alternatively there are also special instructions
available which allow to replace a valid entry with a different valid
entry (e.g. crdte or cspg).

Given that the HVO code currently does not provide the hooks to allow for
an implementation which is compliant with the s390 architecture
requirements, disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP again, which is
basically a revert of the original patch which enabled it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68180 | drm/amd/display: Fix NULL deref in debugfs odm_combine_segments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68180</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

However, drm_put_dev() is still in the probe error and device remove

ima: don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr

Currently when both IMA and EVM are in fix mode, the IMA signature will
be reset to IMA hash if a program first stores IMA signature in
security.ima and then writes/removes some other security xattr for the
file.

For example, on Fedora, after booting the kernel with "ima_appraise=fix
evm=fix ima_policy=appraise_tcb" and installing rpm-plugin-ima,
installing/reinstalling a package will not make good reference IMA
signature generated. Instead IMA hash is generated,

    # getfattr -m - -d -e hex /usr/bin/bash
    # file: usr/bin/bash
    security.ima=0x0404...

This happens because when setting security.selinux, the IMA_DIGSIG flag
that had been set early was cleared. As a result, IMA hash is generated
when the file is closed.

Similarly, IMA signature can be cleared on file close after removing
security xattr like security.evm or setting/removing ACL.

Prevent replacing the IMA file signature with a file hash, by preventing
the IMA_DIGSIG flag from being reset.

Here's a minimal C reproducer which sets security.selinux as the last
step which can also replaced by removing security.evm or setting ACL,

    #include 
    #include xattr.h&gt;
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 

    int main() {
        const char* file_path = "usr/sbin/test_binary";
        const char* hex_string = "030204d33204490066306402304";
        int length = strlen(hex_string);
        char* ima_attr_value;
        int fd;

        fd = open(file_path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0644);
        if (fd == -1) {
            perror("Error opening file");
            return 1;
        }

drm/mediatek: Disable AFBC support on Mediatek DRM driver

Commit c410fa9b07c3 ("drm/mediatek: Add AFBC support to Mediatek DRM
driver") added AFBC support to Mediatek DRM and enabled the
32x8/split/sparse modifier.

However, this is currently broken on Mediatek MT8188 (Genio 700 EVK
platform); tested using upstream Kernel and Mesa (v25.2.1), AFBC is used by
default since Mesa v25.0.

Kernel trace reports vblank timeouts constantly, and the render is garbled:

ring-buffer: Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up

The function ring_buffer_map_get_reader() is a bit more strict than the
other get reader functions, and except for certain situations the
rb_get_reader_page() should not return NULL. If it does, it triggers a
warning.

This warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because
another acceptable situation was happening and it wasn't checked for.

If the reader catches up to the writer and there's still data to be read
on the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as
there's no new page to get.

In this situation, the reader page should not be updated and no warning
should trigger.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68187 | net: mdio: Check regmap pointer returned by device_node_to_regmap()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68187</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imon: make send_packet() more robust

syzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in
hung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].

First problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
after ictx-&gt;dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()
resubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes
usb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in
printk() flooding (RCU stalls).

Alan Stern commented [2] that

  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust
  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the
  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a
  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to
  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more
  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in
  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong
  with giving up right away.

but imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;
this behavior should be fixed.

Since I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any
error code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from
modules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.
ir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).

Second problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
before ictx-&gt;dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always
resubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf ("[media] imon: don't wedge
hardware after early callbacks"). Move the ictx-&gt;dev_present_intf0 test
introduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a ("[media] imon: don't parse scancodes
until intf configured") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or
the first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.
hung task).

Third problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some
reason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes
prevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),
wait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.
hung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to
wait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:01:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68195 | x86/CPU/AMD: Add missing terminator for zen5_rdseed_microcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68195</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arch_topology: Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()

Fix incorrect use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()
which causes the code to proceed with NULL clock pointers. The current
logic uses !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) which evaluates to true for both
valid pointers and NULL, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference
in clk_get_rate().

Per include/linux/err.h documentation, PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(ptr) returns:
"The error code within @ptr if it is an error pointer; 0 otherwise."

This means PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() returns 0 for both valid pointers AND NULL
pointers. Therefore !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) evaluates to true (proceed)
when cpu_clk is either valid or NULL, causing clk_get_rate(NULL) to be
called when of_clk_get() returns NULL.

Replace with !IS_ERR_OR_NULL(cpu_clk) which only proceeds for valid
pointers, preventing potential NULL pointer dereference in clk_get_rate().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40347 | net: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40347</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock

After applying the workaround for err050089, the LS1028A platform
experiences RCU stalls on RT kernel. This issue is caused by the
recursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some
of the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to
a deadlock:

enetc_poll
  -&gt; enetc_lock_mdio
  -&gt; enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done
     -&gt; napi_gro_receive
        -&gt; enetc_start_xmit
           -&gt; enetc_lock_mdio
           -&gt; enetc_map_tx_buffs
           -&gt; enetc_unlock_mdio
  -&gt; enetc_unlock_mdio

After enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts
to acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a
read lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under
enetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already

Currently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent
recursive lock acquisition.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40348 | slab: Avoid race on slab-&amp;gt;obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40348</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: Avoid race on slab-&gt;obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts

If two competing threads enter alloc_slab_obj_exts() and one of them
fails to allocate the object extension vector, it might override the
valid slab-&gt;obj_exts allocated by the other thread with
OBJEXTS_ALLOC_FAIL. This will cause the thread that lost this race and
expects a valid pointer to dereference a NULL pointer later on.

Update slab-&gt;obj_exts atomically using cmpxchg() to avoid
slab-&gt;obj_exts overrides by racing threads.

Thanks for Vlastimil and Suren's help with debugging.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40349 | hfs: validate record offset in hfsplus_bmap_alloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40349</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When calling hfsplus_bmap_alloc to allocate a free node, this function
first retrieves the bitmap from header node and map node using node-&gt;page
together with the offset and length from hfs_brec_lenoff

```
len = hfs_brec_lenoff(node, 2, &amp;amp;off16);
off = off16;

off += node-&gt;page_offset;
pagep = node-&gt;page + (off &gt;&gt; PAGE_SHIFT);
data = kmap_local_page(*pagep);
```

However, if the retrieved offset or length is invalid(i.e. exceeds
node_size), the code may end up accessing pages outside the allocated
range for this node.

This patch adds proper validation of both offset and length before use,
preventing out-of-bounds page access. Move is_bnode_offset_valid and
check_and_correct_requested_length to hfsplus_fs.h, as they may be
required by other functions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40350 | net/mlx5e: RX, Fix generating skb from non-linear xdp_buff for striding RQ</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40350</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: RX, Fix generating skb from non-linear xdp_buff for striding RQ

XDP programs can change the layout of an xdp_buff through
bpf_xdp_adjust_tail() and bpf_xdp_adjust_head(). Therefore, the driver
cannot assume the size of the linear data area nor fragments. Fix the
bug in mlx5 by generating skb according to xdp_buff after XDP programs
run.

Currently, when handling multi-buf XDP, the mlx5 driver assumes the
layout of an xdp_buff to be unchanged. That is, the linear data area
continues to be empty and fragments remain the same. This may cause
the driver to generate erroneous skb or triggering a kernel
warning. When an XDP program added linear data through
bpf_xdp_adjust_head(), the linear data will be ignored as
mlx5e_build_linear_skb() builds an skb without linear data and then
pull data from fragments to fill the linear data area. When an XDP
program has shrunk the non-linear data through bpf_xdp_adjust_tail(),
the delta passed to __pskb_pull_tail() may exceed the actual nonlinear
data size and trigger the BUG_ON in it.

To fix the issue, first record the original number of fragments. If the
number of fragments changes after the XDP program runs, rewind the end
fragment pointer by the difference and recalculate the truesize. Then,
build the skb with the linear data area matching the xdp_buff. Finally,
only pull data in if there is non-linear data and fill the linear part
up to 256 bytes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40351 | hfsplus: fix KMSAN uninit-value issue in hfsplus_delete_cat()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40351</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a ("mm: migrate:
support poisoned recover from migrate folio"), folio_mc_copy() is called
before __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the
copy will be done again to the same destination page. Since
copy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy
will warn.

Replace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64
copy_highpage() with a comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:46:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40354 | drm/amd/display: increase max link count and fix link-&amp;gt;enc NULL pointer access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40354</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The process like this:

               (CPU1)              |             (CPU2)
  ---------------------------------|-------------------------------
  inet_create()                    |

                                   |
    // add sk to hash table        |
    smc_inet_init_sock()           |
      smc_sk_init()                |
        smc_hash_sk()              |
                                   | // traverse the hash table

    smc_create_clcsk               |
      sock_create_kern             |

With CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y, the smc-&gt;clcsock is unexpectedly changed
in inet_init_csk_locks(). The INET_PROTOSW_ICSK flag is no need by smc,
just remove it.

After removing the INET_PROTOSW_ICSK flag, this patch alse revert
commit 6fd27ea183c2 ("net/smc: fix lacks of icsk_syn_mss with IPPROTO_SMC")
to avoid casting smc_sock to inet_connection_sock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:46:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14780 | Xiongwei Smart Catering Cloud Platform dish_trade_detail_get sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14780</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in Xiongwei Smart Catering Cloud Platform 2.1.6446.28761.

This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the 'url' parameter of the fpd_custom_uplod_file AJAX action, which flows directly into the getimagesize() function without sanitization. While direct exploitation via PHP filter chains is blocked on PHP 8+ due to a separate code bug in the plugin, the vulnerability can be exploited via a TOCTOU race condition (CVE-2025-13231) also present in the same plugin, or may be directly exploitable on PHP 7.x installations.

An IDOR (Broken Access Control) vulnerability exists in the admin API endpoints for authorization resource management, specifically in ResourceSetService and PermissionTicketService. The system checks authorization against the resourceServer (client) ID provided in the API request, but the backend database lookup and modification operations (findById, delete) only use the resourceId. This mismatch allows an authenticated attacker with fine-grained admin permissions for one client (e.g., Client A) to delete or update resources belonging to another client (Client B) within the same realm by supplying a valid resource ID.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 05:13:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59479 | CHOCO TEI WATCHER mini (IB-MCT001) contains an issue with improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames.

Prior to version 0.5.3, a security vulnerability exists in the Mermaid diagram rendering component that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Due to the exposure of the Electron IPC renderer to the DOM, this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw escalates to full Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. Two concurrent issues, unsafe Mermaid configuration and an exposed IPC interface, cause this issue. Version 0.5.3 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67751 | ChurchCRM has SQL Injection in Event Editor via `EN_tyid` Parameter caused by an Incomplete Fix</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67751</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `EventEditor.php` file. When creating a new event and selecting an event type, the `EN_tyid` POST parameter is not sanitized. This allows an authenticated user with event management permissions (`isAddEvent`) to execute arbitrary SQL queries. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67874 | ChurchCRM has plaintext password return in response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67874</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, the application echoes back plaintext passwords submitted by users in subsequent HTTP responses. This information disclosure significantly increases the risk of credential compromise and may amplify the impact of other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, IDOR, session fixation), enabling attackers to harvest other users’ passwords. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68113 | ALTCHA Proof-of-Work Vulnerable to Challenge Splicing and Replay</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68113</link><description>ALTCHA is privacy-first software for captcha and bot protection. A cryptographic semantic binding flaw in ALTCHA libraries allows challenge payload splicing, which may enable replay attacks. The HMAC signature does not unambiguously bind challenge parameters to the nonce, allowing an attacker to reinterpret a valid proof-of-work submission with a modified expiration value. This may allow previously solved challenges to be reused beyond their intended lifetime, depending on server-side replay handling and deployment assumptions. The vulnerability primarily impacts abuse-prevention mechanisms such as rate limiting and bot mitigation. It does not directly affect data confidentiality or integrity. This issue has been addressed by enforcing explicit semantic separation between challenge parameters and the nonce during HMAC computation. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions, which include version 1.0.0 of the altcha Golang package, version 1.0.0 of the altcha Rubygem, version 1.0.0 of the altcha pip package, version 1.0.0 of the altcha Erlang package, version 1.4.1 of the altcha-lib npm package, version 1.3.1 of the altcha-org/altcha Composer package, and version 1.3.0 of the org.altcha:altcha Maven package. As a mitigation, implementations may append a delimiter to the end of the `salt` value prior to HMAC computation (for example, `?expires=&lt;time&gt;&amp;`). This prevents ambiguity between parameters and the nonce and is backward-compatible with existing implementations, as the delimiter is treated as a standard URL parameter separator.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68115 | Parse Server vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Mustache Template Variables</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68115</link><description>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 8.6.1 and 9.1.0-alpha.3, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Parse Server's password reset and email verification HTML pages.

In versions prior to 0.16.0, the endpoint `/upload` allows an authenticated user to write arbitrary files on the system, overwriting binaries and allowing code execution. The upload function takes `file.name` directly from user supplied data without doing any sanitization on the name thus allowing for arbitrary file write. This can be used to overwrite system binaries with ones provided from an attacker allowing full code execution. Version 0.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67492 | Weblate&amp;#x27;s over‑permissive webhook endpoint enables mass repository updates and component enumeration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67492</link><description>Weblate is a web based localization tool.

Prior to versions 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 of the FreePBX framework, an authenticated local privilege escalation exists in the deprecated FreePBX startup script `amportal`. In the deprecated `amportal` utility, the lookup for the `freepbx_engine` file occurs in `/etc/asterisk/` directories. Typically, these are configured by FreePBX as writable by the **asterisk** user and any members of the **asterisk** group. This means that a member of the **asterisk** group can add their own `freepbx_engine` file in `/etc/asterisk/` and upon `amportal` executing, it would exec that file with root permissions (even though the file was created and placed by a non-root user). Version 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 contain a fix for the issue. Other mitigation strategies are also available. Confirm only trusted local OS system users are members of the `asterisk` group. Look for suspicious files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory (via Admin -&gt; Config Edit in the GUI, or via CLI). Double-check that `live_dangerously = no` is set (or unconfigured, as the default is **no**) in `/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf` file. Eliminate any unsafe custom use of Asterisk dial plan applications and functions that potentially can manipulate the file system, e.g., System(), FILE(), etc.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67735 | Netty has a CRLF Injection vulnerability in io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67735</link><description>Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection. Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67736 | Authenticated SQL Injection in FreePBX tts (Text To Speech) module</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67736</link><description>The FreePBX module tts (Text to Speech) for FreePBX, an open-source web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that manages Asterisk. Versions prior to 16.0.5 and 17.0.5 are vulnerable to SQL injection by authenticated users with administrator access. Authenticated users with administrative access to the Administrator Control Panel (ACP) can leverage this SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database and execute code on the system as the `asterisk` user with chained elevation to `root` privileges. Users should upgrade to version 16.0.5 or 17.0.5 to receive a fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67747 | Fickling has missing detection for marshal.loads and types.FunctionType in unsafe modules list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67747</link><description>Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Versions prior to 0.1.6 are missing `marshal` and `types` from the block list of unsafe module imports. Fickling started blocking both modules to address this issue. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious pickle file that can bypass fickling since it misses detections for `types.FunctionType` and `marshal.loads`. A user who deserializes such a file, believing it to be safe, would inadvertently execute arbitrary code on their system. This impacts any user or system that uses Fickling to vet pickle files for security issues. The issue was fixed in version 0.1.6.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:20:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67748 | Fickling has Code Injection vulnerability via pty.spawn()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67748</link><description>Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer.
