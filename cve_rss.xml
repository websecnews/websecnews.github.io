In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.

This feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 13:21:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31234 | WordPress Tilda Publishing plugin &amp;lt;= 0.3.23 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31234</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Tilda Publishing.This issue affects Tilda Publishing: from n/a through 0.3.23.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 13:21:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4588 | DedeCMS mytag_add.php cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4588</link><description>A vulnerability was found in DedeCMS 5.7.

race condition vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, specifically within the user invite acceptance process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 23:48:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29941 | Credential Cloning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29941</link><description>Insecure storage of the ICT MIFARE and DESFire encryption keys in the firmware

An attacker with the ability to send DHCP messages can manipulate routes to redirect VPN traffic, allowing the attacker to read, disrupt, or possibly modify network traffic that was expected to be protected by the VPN. Many, if not most VPN systems based on IP routing are susceptible to such attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34375 | WordPress Sheets to WP Table Live Sync plugin &amp;lt;= 3.7.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34375</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WPPOOL Sheets To WP Table Live Sync allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Sheets To WP Table Live Sync: from n/a through 3.7.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34376 | WordPress Edge theme &amp;lt;= 2.0.9 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34376</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Theme Freesia Edge allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Edge: from n/a through 2.0.9.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34379 | WordPress Restaurant and Cafe theme &amp;lt;= 1.2.1 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34379</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Rara Theme Restaurant and Cafe.This issue affects Restaurant and Cafe: from n/a through 1.2.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34380 | WordPress ChatBot Conversational Forms plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34380</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in QuantumCloud Conversational Forms for ChatBot allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Conversational Forms for ChatBot: from n/a through 1.2.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34381 | WordPress PropertyHive plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.10 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34381</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in PropertyHive allows Stored XSS.This issue affects PropertyHive: from n/a through 2.0.10.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 18:38:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34390 | WordPress Post Grid Master plugin &amp;lt;= 3.4.8 - Auth.

The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 15:01:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33112 | D-Link DIR-845L router v1.01KRb03 and before is vulnerable to Command injection via the hnap_main()func.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33112</link><description>D-Link DIR-845L router v1.01KRb03 and before is vulnerable to Command injection via the hnap_main()func.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34069 | Werkzeug&amp;#x27;s improper usage of a pathname and improper CSRF protection results in the remote command execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34069</link><description>Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32982 | Litestar and Starlite affected by Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (&amp;#x27;Path Traversal&amp;#x27;)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32982</link><description>Litestar and Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.8.3, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability has been discovered in the static file serving component of LiteStar. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit path traversal flaws, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the designated directories. Such access can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or potentially compromise the server. The vulnerability is located in the file path handling mechanism within the static content serving function, specifically at `litestar/static_files/base.py`. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34064 | Jinja vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys to xmlattr filter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34064</link><description>Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `&gt;`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 14:51:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33119 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in
