A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder. This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough. One additionally needs to upgrade Keras to a version with the fix (Keras 3.12).</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:24:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61196 | An issue in BusinessNext CRMnext v.10.8.3.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the comments unput parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61196</link><description>An issue in BusinessNext CRMnext v.10.8.3.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the comments unput parameter</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:24:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64096 | CryptoLib vulnerable to Stack Buffer Overflow in Crypto_Key_Update due to missing TLV length check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64096</link><description>CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prier to 1.4.2, there is a missing bounds check in Crypto_Key_update() (crypto_key_mgmt.c) which allows a remote attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by supplying a TLV packet with a spoofed length field. The function calculates the number of keys from an attacker-controlled field (pdu_len), which may exceed the static array size (kblk[98]), leading to an out-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:24:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62795 | JumpServer Unauthorized LDAP Configuration Access via WebSocket</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62795</link><description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system.

drm/xe: Don't allow evicting of BOs in same VM in array of VM binds

An array of VM binds can potentially evict other buffer objects (BOs)
within the same VM under certain conditions, which may lead to NULL
pointer dereferences later in the bind pipeline. To prevent this, clear
the allow_res_evict flag in the xe_bo_validate call.

v2:
 - Invert polarity of no_res_evict (Thomas)
 - Add comment in code explaining issue (Thomas)

drm/sched: Fix potential double free in drm_sched_job_add_resv_dependencies

When adding dependencies with drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), that
function consumes the fence reference both on success and failure, so in
the latter case the dma_fence_put() on the error path (xarray failed to
expand) is a double free.

Interestingly this bug appears to have been present ever since
commit ebd5f74255b9 ("drm/sched: Add dependency tracking"), since the code
back then looked like this:

drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies():
...
       for (i = 0; i &lt; fence_count; i++) {
               ret = drm_sched_job_add_dependency(job, fences[i]);
               if (ret)
                       break;
       }

       for (; i &lt; fence_count; i++)
               dma_fence_put(fences[i]);

Which means for the failing 'i' the dma_fence_put was already a double
free. Possibly there were no users at that time, or the test cases were
insufficient to hit it.

The bug was then only noticed and fixed after
commit 9c2ba265352a ("drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies v2")
landed, with its fixup of
commit 4eaf02d6076c ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies").

At that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which
commit 963d0b356935 ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder")
noticed and attempted to fix.

But it only moved the double free from happening inside the
drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), when releasing the reference not yet
obtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference already released by
the former in the failure case.

As such it is not easy to identify the right target for the fixes tag so
lets keep it simple and just continue the chain.

While fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking
the reference and not dropping it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40097 | ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not assert we found block group item when creating free space tree

Currently, when building a free space tree at populate_free_space_tree(),
if we are not using the block group tree feature, we always expect to find
block group items (either extent items or a block group item with key type
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY) when we search the extent tree with
btrfs_search_slot_for_read(), so we assert that we found an item. However
this expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in
the current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have
not added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do
not have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.

The insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree
happens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper
insert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction
handle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as
part of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation
if we are low on free space).

So remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block
group tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this
case.

ixgbevf: fix mailbox API compatibility by negotiating supported features

There was backward compatibility in the terms of mailbox API. Various
drivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio
could easily negotiate mailbox API.

This convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.
Commit 0062e7cc955e ("ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code") added support
for IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the
rest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of
support was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such
code paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was
introduced along with introduction of the feature itself.

Commit 339f28964147 ("ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication
between PF and VF") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it
introduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API
version for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version
defined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,
as the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe
driver as it causes crashes.

The issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit
d0725312adf5 ("ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5").
As a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API
to version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.

To fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported
features. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec
and ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.

New mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API
revision, as API version of OOT PF &amp; VF drivers is already increased to
1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.

Features negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new
features when needed in the future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40105 | vfs: Don&amp;#x27;t leak disconnected dentries on umount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfs: Don't leak disconnected dentries on umount

When user calls open_by_handle_at() on some inode that is not cached, we
will create disconnected dentry for it. If such dentry is a directory,
exportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the
dentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons
(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to
lookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we
are trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the
parent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the
parent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this
inconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point
to the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in
disconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until
commit f1ee616214cb ("VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon")
which removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb-&gt;s_anon list.
Thus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely
relies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.
However when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the
scenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries
are "leaked". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise
they stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous "Busy
inodes after unmount" bug. Make sure all dentries created under a
disconnected parent are marked as disconnected as well.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54469 | NeuVector Enforcer is vulnerable to Command Injection and Buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54469</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.


The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor
 process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks 
whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the 
monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.


The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT
 are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without 
validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user 
to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer
 container.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54471 | NeuVector is shipping cryptographic material into its binary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54471</link><description>NeuVector used a hard-coded cryptographic key embedded in the source

Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, an attacker can perform an online brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP, and passwords. While Zitadel allows preventing online brute force attacks in scenarios like TOTP, Email OTP, or passwords using a lockout mechanism. The mechanism is not enabled by default and can cause a denial of service for the corresponding user if enabled. Additionally, the mitigation strategies were not fully implemented in the more recent resource-based APIs.

If a user has set up MFA without this requirement, Zitadel would consider single factor auhtenticated sessions as valid as well and not require multiple factors. Bypassing second authentication factors weakens multifactor authentication and enables attackers to bypass the more secure factor.

Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, a potential vulnerability exists in ZITADEL's password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. It's important to note that this specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:49:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11232 | Invalid characters cause assert</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11232</link><description>To trigger the issue, three configuration parameters must have specific settings: "hostname-char-set" must be left at the default setting, which is "[^A-Za-z0-9.-]"; "hostname-char-replacement" must be empty (the default); and "ddns-qualifying-suffix" must *NOT* be empty (the default is empty).

While the content of these fields is properly redacted in the _source document returned by search operations, the results do return documents (hits) when searching based on a specific IP values. This allows to reconstruct the original contents of the field.

Workaround - If you cannot upgrade immediately, you can avoid the problem by using field level security (FLS) protection on fields of the affected types instead of field masking.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62785 | Wazuh fillData NULL pointer dereference causes analysisd crash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62785</link><description>Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. fillData() implementation does not check whether value is NULL or not before calling os_strdup() on it. A compromised agent can cause a crash of analysisd by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause analysisd to crash and make it unavailable.

When an FLS exclusion rule (e.g., ~field) is applied to a field which contains an object as its value, the object is correctly removed from the _source returned by search operations. However, the object members (i.e., child attributes) remain accessible to search queries. This exposure allows adversaries to infer or reconstruct the original contents of the excluded object.




Workaround - If you cannot upgrade immediately and FLS exclusion rules are used for object valued attributes (like ~object), add an additional exclusion rule for the members of the object (like ~object.*).</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:39:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54384 | CKAN stored XSS vulnerability in Markdown description fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54384</link><description>CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals.

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue

To prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)
when cl-&gt;qdisc-&gt;ops-&gt;peek(cl-&gt;qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return
value before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.

To avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:

1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static
inline function.

2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to
include/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.

3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:48:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40084 | ksmbd: transport_ipc: validate payload size before reading handle</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40084</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This vulnerability stems from the way the StringLookup layer is handled during model loading from a specially crafted .keras archive. The constructor for the StringLookup layer accepts a vocabulary argument that can specify a local file path or a remote file path.

  *  Arbitrary Local File Read: An attacker can create a malicious .keras file that embeds a local path in the StringLookup layer's configuration. When the model is loaded, Keras will attempt to read the content of the specified local file and incorporate it into the model state (e.g., retrievable via get_vocabulary()), allowing an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the hosting system.


  *  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Keras utilizes tf.io.gfile for file operations. Since tf.io.gfile supports remote filesystem handlers (such as GCS and HDFS) and HTTP/HTTPS protocols, the same mechanism can be leveraged to fetch content from arbitrary network endpoints on the server's behalf, resulting in an SSRF condition.


The security issue is that the feature allowing external path loading was not properly restricted by the safe_mode=True flag, which was intended to prevent such unintended data access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 08:57:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58711 | WordPress Blog Designer PRO plugin &amp;lt;= 3.4.8 -

The weakness arises due to insufficient validation of user input in plugin endpoints, allowing crafted input to influence backend queries in unexpected ways. Using specially crafted payloads, this can escalate into unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary object injection in PHP. Although the issue is remotely exploitable without authentication, it does require a crafted interaction with the affected endpoint in order to trigger successfully.</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:45:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64094 | DNN vulnerable to stored cross-site-scripting (XSS) via SVG upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64094</link><description>DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Versions 1.7.7 through 2.0.1 allow persistent HTML injection via the unsanitized attachment filename (attachment_name) when attachments are enabled. An attacker can modify attachment_name before encryption so that, after decryption, arbitrary HTML is inserted unescaped into the page near the file size hint, enabling redirect (e.g., meta refresh) and site defacement and related phishing attacks. Script execution is normally blocked by the recommended Content Security Policy, limiting confidentiality impact. The issue was introduced in 1.7.7 and fixed in 2.0.2. Update to 2.0.2 or later. Workarounds include enforcing the recommended CSP, deploying PrivateBin on a separate domain, or disabling attachments.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 20:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61598 | Discourse is missing Cache-Control response header on error responses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61598</link><description>Discourse is an open source discussion platform.

The root cause is insufficient synchronization and lack of robust final-path validation in the threat-removal workflow: the agent records an active-response action and proceeds to perform deletion without guaranteeing the deletion target is the originally intended file. This can result in SYSTEM-level arbitrary file or folder deletion and consequent local privilege escalation.

pinctrl: check the return value of pinmux_ops::get_function_name()

While the API contract in docs doesn't specify it explicitly, the
generic implementation of the get_function_name() callback from struct
pinmux_ops - pinmux_generic_get_function_name() - can fail and return
NULL. This is already checked in pinmux_check_ops() so add a similar
check in pinmux_func_name_to_selector() instead of passing the returned
pointer right down to strcmp() where the NULL can get dereferenced. This
is normal operation when adding new pinfunctions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40031 | tee: fix register_shm_helper()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40031</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/AER: Avoid NULL pointer dereference in aer_ratelimit()

When platform firmware supplies error information to the OS, e.g., via the
ACPI APEI GHES mechanism, it may identify an error source device that
doesn't advertise an AER Capability and therefore dev-&gt;aer_info, which
contains AER stats and ratelimiting data, is NULL.

pci_dev_aer_stats_incr() already checks dev-&gt;aer_info for NULL, but
aer_ratelimit() did not, leading to NULL pointer dereferences like this one
from the URL below:

[8086:2020] is an Intel "Sky Lake-E DMI3 Registers" device that claims to
be a Root Port but does not advertise an AER Capability.

Add a NULL check in aer_ratelimit() to avoid the NULL pointer dereference.
Note that this also prevents ratelimiting these events from GHES.

The pm_domain cleanup can not be devres managed as it uses struct

unregister_framebuffer() in simplefb_remove().
Devres managed cleanup runs after the device remove call and thus can no
longer access struct simplefb_par.

the cleanup functions for clocks and regulators.

Fixes an use after free on M2 Mac mini during
aperture_remove_conflicting_devices() using the downstream asahi kernel
with Debian's kernel config. For unknown reasons this started to
consistently dereference an invalid pointer in v6.16.3 based kernels.

KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid

Skip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP
isn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must
decode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the
next RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading
guest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.
can sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs
disabled.

ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access

The 'sess-&gt;rpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd
session. Access to this list is intended to be protected by
'sess-&gt;rpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was
flawed, leading to potential race conditions.

In ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock
before calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify
the XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access
and prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.

Furthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()
without holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent
data or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and
the pointer is dereferenced.

Fix these issues by:
1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()
   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring
   the lock is correctly released on error paths.
2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()
   to safely protect the lookup.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40040 | mm/ksm: fix flag-dropping behavior in ksm_madvise</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40040</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Kernel panics because it detects UFFD inconsistency during
userfaultfd_release_all().  Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer
to vma-&gt;vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma-&gt;vm_flags.

The inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()
with MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,
it accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of
vma-&gt;vm_flags.

Assuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and
int are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &amp;=
~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.

VM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. 
After ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then
promoted to unsigned long before the &amp; operation.  This promotion fills
upper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and
even for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).
&amp; operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff
instead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears
the upper 32-bits of its value.

Fix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the
BIT() macro.

Note: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the
VM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int
and after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted
to unsigned long with leading 1s.

Note 2:
After commit 31defc3b01d9 ("userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s"), this is
no longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:

[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067

The bpf_fifo_dequeue prog returns a skb which is a pointer. The pointer
is treated as a 32bit value and sign extend to 64bit in epilogue. This
behavior is right for most bpf prog types but wrong for struct ops which
requires LoongArch ABI.

So let's sign extend struct ops return values according to the LoongArch
ABI ([1]) and return value spec in function model.

Race Condition Analysis:

The race occurs between kprobe activation and perf_events initialization:

  CPU0                                    CPU1
  ====                                    ====
  perf_kprobe_init
    perf_trace_event_init
      tp_event-&gt;perf_events = list;(1)
      tp_event-&gt;class-&gt;reg (2)← KPROBE ACTIVE
                                          Debug exception triggers
                                          ...
                                          kprobe_dispatcher
                                            kprobe_perf_func (tk-&gt;tp.flags &amp; TP_FLAG_PROFILE)
                                              head = this_cpu_ptr(call-&gt;perf_events)(3)
                                              (perf_events is still NULL)

Problem:
1. CPU0 executes (1) assigning tp_event-&gt;perf_events = list
2. CPU0 executes (2) enabling kprobe functionality via class-&gt;reg()
3. CPU1 triggers and reaches kprobe_dispatcher
4. CPU1 checks TP_FLAG_PROFILE - condition passes (step 2 completed)
5. CPU1 calls kprobe_perf_func() and crashes at (3) because
   call-&gt;perf_events is still NULL

CPU1 sees that kprobe functionality is enabled but does not see that
perf_events has been assigned.

net: nfc: nci: Add parameter validation for packet data

Syzbot reported an uninitialized value bug in nci_init_req, which was
introduced by commit 5aca7966d2a7 ("Merge tag
'perf-tools-fixes-for-v6.17-2025-09-16' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools").

This bug arises due to very limited and poor input validation
that was done at nic_valid_size(). This validation only
validates the skb-&gt;len (directly reflects size provided at the
userspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer
itself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing
of memory content at the address assuming the correct layout
per what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to
buffer of `skb_buff-&gt;data` which is not assigned anything yet.

Following the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at
`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective
handlers and return error values in case of failure. Release
the skb if error values are returned from handlers in
`nci_nft_packet` and effectively do a silent drop

Possible TODO: because we silently drop the packets, the
call to `nci_request` will be waiting for completion of request
and will face timeouts. These timeouts can get excessively logged
in the dmesg. A proper handling of them may require to export
`nci_request_cancel` (or propagate error handling from the
nft packets handlers).</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40044 | fs: udf: fix OOB read in lengthAllocDescs handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40044</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When parsing Allocation Extent Descriptor, lengthAllocDescs comes from
on-disk data and must be validated against the block size. Crafted or

length (sizeof(allocExtDesc) + lengthAllocDescs) exceeds the buffer,
leading udf_update_tag() to call crc_itu_t() on out-of-bounds memory and

uio_hv_generic: Let userspace take care of interrupt mask

Remove the logic to set interrupt mask by default in uio_hv_generic
driver as the interrupt mask value is supposed to be controlled
completely by the user space. If the mask bit gets changed
by the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,
the mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the
user-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.

For eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,
the host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.
However, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a
message in the inbound ring buffer. So let’s assume that happens,
the host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.

Subsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring
buffer interrupt mask to 0, saying “Hey, I’m ready for interrupts”.
User space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.
Then one of two things happens:

* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.
* The host does send another message. But because there’s already a
  message in the ring buffer, it doesn’t generate an interrupt.
  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an
  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to
  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not
  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.
  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from
  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.

This could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay
setting interrupt mask to 0.

Similarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,
there’s a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring
buffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could
put another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn’t interrupt.
Then the next pread() would hang.

Fix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,
while keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace
control the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40049 | Squashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent

Syzkaller reports a "KMSAN: uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent" bug.

This is caused by open_by_handle_at() being called with a file handle
containing an invalid parent inode number.  In particular the inode number
is that of a symbolic link, rather than a directory.

Squashfs_get_parent() gets called with that symbolic link inode, and
accesses the parent member field.

	unsigned int parent_ino = squashfs_i(inode)-&gt;parent;

Because non-directory inodes in Squashfs do not have a parent value, this
is uninitialised, and this causes an uninitialised value access.

The fix is to initialise parent with the invalid inode 0, which will cause

In check_alu_op(), the verifier currently calls check_reg_arg() and

However, if the destination register holds a pointer, these scalar

This patch adds a check to skip the adjustment logic when the destination

smb: client: fix crypto buffers in non-linear memory

The crypto API, through the scatterlist API, expects input buffers to be
in linear memory.  We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper
that converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.

However, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in
smb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly
puts aead_request-&gt;__ctx in vmalloc area.

AEAD algorithm then uses -&gt;__ctx for its private/internal data and
operations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.

This works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small
requests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.

Tasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too
many tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where
virt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that
happens.

In practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount
will trigger this bug.

To fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead.
Also drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since
kfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.

iommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk

Dirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit
in the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-
structure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In
another word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking
doesn't work.

The Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 "Snoop Behavior" states:

"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits
 in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-
 recoverable fault."

To prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page
tracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as
supported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40059 | coresight: Fix incorrect handling for return value of devm_kzalloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40059</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: trbe: Return NULL pointer for allocation failures

When the TRBE driver fails to allocate a buffer, it currently returns
the error code "-ENOMEM". However, the caller etm_setup_aux() only
checks for a NULL pointer, so it misses the error. As a result, the
driver continues and eventually causes a kernel panic.

Fix this by returning a NULL pointer from arm_trbe_alloc_buffer() on
allocation failures. This allows that the callers can properly handle
the failure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40061 | RDMA/rxe: Fix race in do_task() when draining</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40061</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix race in do_task() when draining

When do_task() exhausts its iteration budget (!ret), it sets the state
to TASK_STATE_IDLE to reschedule, without a secondary check on the
current task-&gt;state. This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state
set by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().

While state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()
and rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to
finish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if
do_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.
The cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly
reschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.

This bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,
where the special handling for the draining case was lost.

Fix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is
TASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to
force a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so
that a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly
transition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40062 | crypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm-&amp;gt;debug.qm_diff_regs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40062</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops

In commit 42d9f6c77479 ("crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation
code into acomp"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on
having the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order
as the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and
free_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout
randomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure
(containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg
are randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then
the order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the
union from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg
will share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring
they will always have the same layout.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40064 | smc: Fix use-after-free in __pnet_find_base_ndev().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40064</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Fix use-after-free in __pnet_find_base_ndev().

syzbot reported use-after-free of net_device in __pnet_find_base_ndev(),
which was called during connect(). [0]

smc_pnet_find_ism_resource() fetches sk_dst_get(sk)-&gt;dev and passes
down to pnet_find_base_ndev(), where RTNL is held.  Then, UAF happened
at __pnet_find_base_ndev() when the dev is first used.

This means dev had already been freed before acquiring RTNL in
pnet_find_base_ndev().

While dev is going away, dst-&gt;dev could be swapped with blackhole_netdev,
and the dev's refcnt by dst will be released.

We must hold dev's refcnt before calling smc_pnet_find_ism_resource().

Also, smc_pnet_find_roce_resource() has the same problem.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in the two functions.

fs/ntfs3: reject index allocation if $BITMAP is empty but blocks exist

Index allocation requires at least one bit in the $BITMAP attribute to
track usage of index entries. If the bitmap is empty while index blocks
are already present, this reflects on-disk corruption.

syzbot triggered this condition using a malformed NTFS image. During a
rename() operation involving a long filename (which spans multiple
index entries), the empty bitmap allowed the name to be added without
valid tracking. Subsequent deletion of the original entry failed with
-ENOENT, due to unexpected index state.

Reject such cases by verifying that the bitmap is not empty when index
blocks exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40068 | fs: ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in run_unpack()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40068</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in run_unpack()

The MFT record relative to the file being opened contains its runlist,
an array containing information about the file's location on the physical
disk. Analysis of all Call Stack paths showed that the values of the
runlist array, from which LCNs are calculated, are not validated before
run_unpack function.

The run_unpack function decodes the compressed runlist data format
from MFT attributes (for example, $DATA), converting them into a runs_tree
structure, which describes the mapping of virtual clusters (VCN) to
logical clusters (LCN). The NTFS3 subsystem also has a shortcut for
deleting files from MFT records - in this case, the RUN_DEALLOCATE
command is sent to the run_unpack input, and the function logic
provides that all data transferred to the runlist about file or
directory is deleted without creating a runs_tree structure.

Substituting the runlist in the $DATA attribute of the MFT record for an
arbitrary file can lead either to access to arbitrary data on the disk
bypassing access checks to them (since the inode access check
occurs above) or to destruction of arbitrary data on the disk.

Add overflow check for addition operation.

before device_register(). Otherwise, when device_register() return error
and put_device() try to callback the release function, the below warning

pps_register_cdev() call device_create() to create pps-&gt;dev, which will
init dev-&gt;release to device_create_release(). Now the comment is outdated,

Thanks for the reminder from Calvin Owens, 'kfree_pps' should be removed

tty: n_gsm: Don't block input queue by waiting MSC

Currently gsm_queue() processes incoming frames and when opening
a DLC channel it calls gsm_dlci_open() which calls gsm_modem_update().
If basic mode is used it calls gsm_modem_upd_via_msc() and it
cannot block the input queue by waiting the response to come
into the same input queue.

Instead allow sending Modem Status Command without waiting for remote
end to respond. Define a new function gsm_modem_send_initial_msc()
for this purpose. As MSC is only valid for basic encoding, it does
not do anything for advanced or when convergence layer type 2 is used.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40072 | fanotify: Validate the return value of mnt_ns_from_dentry() before dereferencing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fanotify: Validate the return value of mnt_ns_from_dentry() before dereferencing

The function do_fanotify_mark() does not validate if
mnt_ns_from_dentry() returns NULL before dereferencing mntns-&gt;user_ns.
This causes a NULL pointer dereference in do_fanotify_mark() if the
path is not a mount namespace object.

Fix this by checking mnt_ns_from_dentry()'s return value before
dereferencing it.

has no reference to the parent IRQ domain. Using msi-&gt;domain-&gt;parent as an
argument for generic_handle_domain_irq() leads to below error:

	"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address"

This error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host
controller driver to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a
similar pattern to handle MSIs (see link section)), but it was not tested
on hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver due to lack of
hardware.

bpf: Explicitly check accesses to bpf_sock_addr

Syzkaller found a kernel warning on the following sock_addr program:

    0: r0 = 0
    1: r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +60)
    2: exit

which triggers:

    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion (0)

This is happening because offset 60 in bpf_sock_addr corresponds to an
implicit padding of 4 bytes, right after msg_src_ip4. Access to this
padding isn't rejected in sock_addr_is_valid_access and it thus later
fails to convert the access.

This patch fixes it by explicitly checking the various fields of
bpf_sock_addr in sock_addr_is_valid_access.

I checked the other ctx structures and is_valid_access functions and
didn't find any other similar cases. Other cases of (properly handled)
padding are covered in new tests in a subsequent patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40079 | riscv, bpf: Sign extend struct ops return values properly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40079</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The bpf_fifo_dequeue prog returns a skb which is a pointer. The pointer
is treated as a 32bit value and sign extend to 64bit in epilogue. This
behavior is right for most bpf prog types but wrong for struct ops which
requires RISC-V ABI.

So let's sign extend struct ops return values according to the function
model and RISC-V ABI([0]).

When hfsplus_uni2asc is called from hfsplus_listxattr,
it actually passes in a struct hfsplus_attr_unistr*.
The size of the corresponding structure is different from that of hfsplus_unistr,
so the previous fix (94458781aee6) is insufficient.
The pointer on the unicode buffer is still going beyond the allocated memory.

This patch introduces two warpper functions hfsplus_uni2asc_xattr_str and
hfsplus_uni2asc_str to process two unicode buffers,
struct hfsplus_attr_unistr* and struct hfsplus_unistr* respectively.
When ustrlen value is bigger than the allocated memory size,
the ustrlen value is limited to an safe size.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9313 | Unauthorized database access in Asseco mMedica</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9313</link><description>An unauthenticated user can connect to a publicly accessible database using arbitrary credentials.

w/ a fuzzed image, f2fs may encounter panic due to it detects inconsistent
truncation range in direct node in f2fs_truncate_hole().

The root cause is: a non-inode dnode may has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid, so the dnode will be parsed as an inode, then ADDRS_PER_PAGE()
may return wrong blkaddr count which may be 923 typically, by chance,
dn.ofs_in_node is equal to 923, then count can be calculated to 0 in below
statement, later it will trigger panic w/ f2fs_bug_on(, count == 0 || ...).

	count = min(end_offset - dn.ofs_in_node, pg_end - pg_start);

This patch introduces a new node_type NODE_TYPE_NON_INODE, then allowing
passing the new_type to sanity_check_node_footer in f2fs_get_node_folio()
to detect corruption that a non-inode dnode has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid.

KVM: x86: Don't (re)check L1 intercepts when completing userspace I/O

When completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit
for I/O, don't recheck L1 intercepts as KVM has already finished that
phase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing L2
to perform I/O.  If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission
bitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being
intercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.

Pivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation.
Of the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the
intended "recipient") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s
use is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and
complete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with
EMULTYPE_SKIP.

The bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O
interception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN
on vcpu-&gt;arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation
of the I/O instruction.

Commit 74d6a5d56629 ("9p/trans_fd: Fix concurrency del of req_list in
p9_fd_cancelled/p9_read_work") fixes a concurrency issue in the 9p filesystem
client where the req_list could be deleted simultaneously by both
p9_read_work and p9_fd_cancelled functions, but for the case where req-&gt;status
equals REQ_STATUS_RCVD.

Update the check for req-&gt;status in p9_fd_cancelled to skip processing not
just received requests, but anything that is not SENT, as whatever
changed the state from SENT also removed the request from its list.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

[updated the check from status == RECV || status == ERROR to status != SENT]</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 09:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40028 | binder: fix double-free in dbitmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix double-free in dbitmap

A process might fail to allocate a new bitmap when trying to expand its
proc-&gt;dmap. In that case, dbitmap_grow() fails and frees the old bitmap
via dbitmap_free(). However, the driver calls dbitmap_free() again when
the same process terminates, leading to a double-free error:
