To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version &lt;=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow "escaping" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 19:10:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5841 | OpenEXR Heap Overflow in Scanline Deep Data Parsing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5841</link><description>Due to a failure in validating the number of scanline samples of a OpenEXR file containing deep scanline data, Academy Software Foundation OpenEX image parsing library version 3.2.1 and prior is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 18:37:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1167 | SEW-EURODRIVE MOVITOOLS MotionStudio Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1167</link><description>When SEW-EURODRIVE MOVITOOLS MotionStudio processes XML information unrestricted file access can occur.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24570 | Statamic account takeover via XSS and password reset link</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24570</link><description>Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. HTML files crafted to look like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS. This affects the front-end forms with asset fields without any mime type validation, asset fields in the control panel, and asset browser in the control panel. Additionally, if the XSS is crafted in a specific way, the "copy password reset link" feature may be exploited to gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to occur. In versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 16:49:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24561 | Vyper bounds check on built-in `slice()` function can be overflowed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24561</link><description>Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and earlier, the bounds check for slices does not account for the ability for start + length to overflow when the values aren't literals. If a slice() function uses a non-literal argument for the start or length variable, this creates the ability for an attacker to overflow the bounds check. This issue can be used to do OOB access to storage, memory or calldata addresses. It can also be used to corrupt the length slot of the respective array.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 16:42:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24557 | Moby classic builder cache poisoning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24557</link><description>Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 16:35:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23832 | Mastodon Remote user impersonation and takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23832</link><description>Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub Mastodon allows configuration of LDAP for authentication.

When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and for each which contains a file, it is extracted and saved in `/tmp` with a random filename starting with `bref_upload_`. The flow mimics what plain PHP does but it does not delete the temporary files when the request has been processed. An attacker could fill the Lambda instance disk by performing multiple MultiPart requests containing files. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 16:27:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24753 | Bref Multiple Value Headers Not Supported in ApiGatewayFormatV2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24753</link><description>Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used in combination with an API Gateway with the v2 format, it does not handle multiple values headers. If PHP generates a response with two headers having the same key but different values only the latest one is kept. If an application relies on multiple headers with the same key being set for security reasons, then Bref would lower the application security. For example, if an application sets multiple `Content-Security-Policy` headers, then Bref would just reflect the latest one.

When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors.

In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql
variable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:38:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24573 | facileManager Privilege Escalation via Mass Assignment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24573</link><description>facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind.

Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:08:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23652 | BuildKit possible host system access from mount stub cleaner</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23652</link><description>BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner.

In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-47072 | SQL injection vulnerability in Enterprise Architect 16.0.1605 32-bit allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands via the Find parameter i...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-47072</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Enterprise Architect 16.0.1605 32-bit allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands via the Find parameter in the Select Classifier dialog box..</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:10:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1117 | openBI Screen.php index code injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1117</link><description>A vulnerability was found in openBI up to 1.0.8.

The vulnerability affects all versions of Label Studio prior to 1.11.0 and was tested on version 1.8.2. Label Studio's SSRF protections that can be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is because the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS lookup to verify that the IP address is not in an excluded subnet range. This protection can be bypassed by either using HTTP redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 16:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23502 | WordPress Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts Plugin &amp;lt;= 3.3.2 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23502</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in InfornWeb Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Posts List Designer by Category – List Category Posts Or Recent Posts: from n/a through 3.3.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:36:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23505 | WordPress PDF Viewer &amp;amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.38 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23505</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in DearHive PDF Viewer &amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF allows Stored XSS.This issue affects PDF Viewer &amp; 3D PDF Flipbook – DearPDF: from n/a through 2.0.38.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23508 | WordPress PDF Poster - PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1.17 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23508</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in bPlugins PDF Poster – PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects PDF Poster – PDF Embedder Plugin for WordPress: from n/a through 2.1.17.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0219 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik JustDecompile Installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0219</link><description>In Telerik JustDecompile versions prior to 2024 R1, a privilege elevation vulnerability has been identified in the applications installer component.  In an environment where an existing Telerik JustDecompile install is present, a lower privileged user has the ability to manipulate the installation package to elevate their privileges on the underlying operating system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0832 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik Reporting Installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0832</link><description>In Telerik Reporting versions prior to 2024 R1, a privilege elevation vulnerability has been identified in the applications installer component.  In an environment where an existing Telerik Reporting install is present, a lower privileged user has the ability to manipulate the installation package to elevate their privileges on the underlying operating system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0833 | Privilege Elevation via Telerik Test Studio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0833</link><description>In Telerik Test Studio versions prior to
