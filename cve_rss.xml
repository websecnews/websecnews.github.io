This is due to the plugin not providing sufficient path validation on the tree_node[node][id] parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin-level access and above, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 09:36:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3211 | The Shopping Cart &amp; eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'productid' attribute of the ec_addtocart sh...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3211</link><description>The Shopping Cart &amp; eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'productid' attribute of the ec_addtocart shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

Fixes for PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and PAN-OS 11.1 are in development and are expected to be released by April 14, 2024. Cloud NGFW, Panorama appliances, and Prisma Access are not impacted by this vulnerability. All other versions of PAN-OS are also not impacted.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 07:29:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27309 | Apache Kafka: Potential incorrect access control during migration from ZK mode to KRaft mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27309</link><description>While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.

Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:
1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL
2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.

When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.

The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).

The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 07:19:30

Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29902 | Cosign vulnerable to system-wide denial of service via malicious attachments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29902</link><description>Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30728 | An issue was discovered in the default configurations of ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30728</link><description>An issue was discovered in the default configurations of ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows unauthenticated attackers to gain access using default credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32001 | SpiceDB: LookupSubjects may return partial results if a specific kind of relation is used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32001</link><description>SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data. Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder-&gt;view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31995 | zcap has incomplete expiration checks in capability chains.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31995</link><description>`@digitalbazaar/zcap` provides JavaScript reference implementation for Authorization Capabilities. Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31999 | @fastify/secure-session: Reuse of destroyed secure session cookie</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31999</link><description>@festify/secure-session creates a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify. At the end of the request handling, it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that, the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests, it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session, but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code, when the session is deleted, it is marked for deletion. However, if an attacker could gain access to the cookie, they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may include a "last update" field in the session, and treat "old sessions" as expired.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31997 | XWiki Platform remote code execution from account through UIExtension parameters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31997</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

sched/fair: Prevent dead task groups from regaining cfs_rq's

Kevin is reporting crashes which point to a use-after-free of a cfs_rq
in update_blocked_averages(). Initial debugging revealed that we've
live cfs_rq's (on_list=1) in an about to be kfree()'d task group in
free_fair_sched_group(). However, it was unclear how that can happen.

His kernel config happened to lead to a layout of struct sched_entity
that put the 'my_q' member directly into the middle of the object
which makes it incidentally overlap with SLUB's freelist pointer.
That, in combination with SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED's freelist pointer
mangling, leads to a reliable access violation in form of a #GP which
made the UAF fail fast.

Michal seems to have run into the same issue[1]. He already correctly
diagnosed that commit a7b359fc6a37 ("sched/fair: Correctly insert
cfs_rq's to list on unthrottle") is causing the preconditions for the
UAF to happen by re-adding cfs_rq's also to task groups that have no
more running tasks, i.e. also to dead ones. His analysis, however,
misses the real root cause and it cannot be seen from the crash
backtrace only, as the real offender is tg_unthrottle_up() getting
called via sched_cfs_period_timer() via the timer interrupt at an
inconvenient time.

When unregister_fair_sched_group() unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying
task group, it doesn't protect itself from getting interrupted. If the
timer interrupt triggers while we iterate over all CPUs or after
unregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but prior to unlinking the
task group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walk the list of
task groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them to the
dying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- be
kfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin
and Michal are seeing.

To fix this race, ensure the dying task group gets unlinked first.
However, simply switching the order of unregistering and unlinking the
task group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers might still see
it, as can be seen below:

Currently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte(), if we
bail out using "goto out_release_unlock;" in the cases where idx &gt;=

restore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation, and the following
call to remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h-&gt;resv_hugepages
causing a 100% reproducible leak.

We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding a page into the
pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true, to indicate that there is
no reservation to restore on the error path, and we need not call
restore_reserve_on_error().  Rename new_pagecache_page to
page_in_pagecache to make that clear.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47215 | net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix crash in RX resync flow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails

When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),
h-&gt;size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h-&gt;htable
pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since
the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed
hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called
on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.

Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid

scsi: core: Fix scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling

Several problems exist with scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling:

 1) The allocation length field of the MODE SENSE(10) command is 16-bits,
    occupying bytes 7 and 8 of the CDB. With this command, access to mode
    pages larger than 255 bytes is thus possible. However, the CDB
    allocation length field is set by assigning len to byte 8 only, thus
    truncating buffer length larger than 255.

 2) If scsi_mode_sense() is called with len smaller than 8 with
    sdev-&gt;use_10_for_ms set, or smaller than 4 otherwise, the buffer length
    is increased to 8 and 4 respectively, and the buffer is zero filled
    with these increased values, thus corrupting the memory following the
    buffer.

Fix these 2 problems by using put_unaligned_be16() to set the allocation
length field of MODE SENSE(10) CDB and by returning an error when len is
too small.

Furthermore, if len is larger than 255B, always try MODE SENSE(10) first,
even if the device driver did not set sdev-&gt;use_10_for_ms. In case of
invalid opcode error for MODE SENSE(10), access to mode pages larger than
255 bytes are not retried using MODE SENSE(6). To avoid buffer length
overflows for the MODE_SENSE(10) case, check that len is smaller than 65535
bytes.

While at it, also fix the folowing:

 * Use get_unaligned_be16() to retrieve the mode data length and block
   descriptor length fields of the mode sense reply header instead of using
   an open coded calculation.

 * Fix the kdoc dbd argument explanation: the DBD bit stands for Disable
   Block Descriptor, which is the opposite of what the dbd argument
   description was.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47183 | scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47183</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference

If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well
known addresses, outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer
dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated "2878" log
messages.

The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS
requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set
the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the
expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is
stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may
auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up, the Abort completions
may reference an invalid structure.

Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due
to conditions where the link failed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47184 | i40e: Fix NULL ptr dereference on VSI filter sync</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47184</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When the sender and workqueue running in different core, the sender sends

arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Fix CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency

The entry/exit latency and minimum residency in state for the idle
states of MSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the
timings were written for CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param
was miscalculated (supposedly, while porting this from downstream);
Then, the power collapse states are setting PC on both the CPU
cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have different timings: in the
specific case of L2 the times are higher so these ones should be
taken into account instead of the CPU ones.

This parameter misconfiguration was not giving particular issues
because on MSM8998 there was no CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2
power collapse was rarely (if ever) hit.
When CPU scaling is enabled, though, the wrong timings will produce
SoC unstability shown to the user as random, apparently error-less,
sudden reboots and/or lockups.

This set of parameters are stabilizing the SoC when CPU scaling is
ON and when power collapse is frequently hit.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47188 | scsi: ufs: core: Improve SCSI abort handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47188</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions

Ordered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread
which executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between
normal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,
unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.

This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where
async_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes
submit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because
async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:

    pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0
    lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0
    sp : ffff800015d4bc20

Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all
accesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before
setting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of
WORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads
would be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures
are all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered
before any access that can occur in ordered_func.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47190 | perf bpf: Avoid memory leak from perf_env__insert_btf()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47190</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In resp_readcap16() we get "int alloc_len" value -1104926854, and then pass
the huge arr_len to fill_from_dev_buffer(), but arr is only 32 bytes. This
leads to OOB in sg_copy_buffer().

To solve this issue, define alloc_len as u32.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47192 | scsi: core: sysfs: Fix hang when device state is set via sysfs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47192</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: sysfs: Fix hang when device state is set via sysfs

This fixes a regression added with:

commit f0f82e2476f6 ("scsi: core: Fix capacity set to zero after
offlinining device")

The problem is that after iSCSI recovery, iscsid will call into the kernel
to set the dev's state to running, and with that patch we now call
scsi_rescan_device() with the state_mutex held. If the SCSI error handler
thread is just starting to test the device in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() then it's
going to try to grab the state_mutex.

We are then stuck, because when scsi_rescan_device() tries to send its I/O
scsi_queue_rq() calls -&gt; scsi_host_queue_ready() -&gt; scsi_host_in_recovery()
which will return true (the host state is still in recovery) and I/O will
just be requeued. scsi_send_eh_cmnd() will then never be able to grab the
state_mutex to finish error handling.

To prevent the deadlock move the rescan-related code to after we drop the
state_mutex.

This also adds a check for if we are already in the running state. This
prevents extra scans and helps the iscsid case where if the transport class
has already onlined the device during its recovery process then we don't
need userspace to do it again plus possibly block that daemon.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47193 | scsi: pm80xx: Fix memory leak during rmmod</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47193</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: CT, Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts

CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the
flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which
hold ct_state.
When such flow also includes encap action, a neigh update event
can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.

Each time this happens, the ct clear handling adds that same set
of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr
actions is reached.

Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and
causing a memleak.

Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocation
into the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.
The release of mod acts will be done in the normal flow_put().

scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()

When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass
the requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local "fail_msg"
string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a
completions list for cancellation.

Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since
"fail_msg" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless
of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to
txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.

Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions
list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions
list unless they had an appropriate failure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47204 | net: dpaa2-eth: fix use-after-free in dpaa2_eth_remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47204</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding

Currently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, while
leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause
a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix
this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,
and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.

This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses the
correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.

Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited error
handling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting
is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47206 | usb: host: ohci-tmio: check return value after calling platform_get_resource()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47206</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, it is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they have rights to edit the users' page.  With the default right scheme in XWiki this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of those pages. There is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again, this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right). A page with a user password xobject which have in its history a revision where the object has been deleted should be considered at risk and the password should be changed there. a diff, to ensure it's not coming from a password field. As another mitigation, admins should ensure that the user pages are properly protected: the edit right shouldn't be allowed for other users than Admin and owner of the profile (which is the default right). There is not much workaround possible for a privileged user other than upgrading XWiki.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 18:54:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31230 | WordPress ShortPixel Adaptive Images plugin &amp;lt;= 3.8.2 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31230</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in ShortPixel ShortPixel Adaptive Images.This issue affects ShortPixel Adaptive Images: from n/a through 3.8.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:49:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31242 | WordPress Bricksforge plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.17 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Email Sending vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31242</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Bricksforge.This issue affects Bricksforge: from n/a through 2.0.17.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:49:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31943 | WordPress USPS Shipping for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;= 1.9.2 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31943</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Octolize USPS Shipping for WooCommerce – Live Rates.This issue affects USPS Shipping for WooCommerce – Live Rates: from n/a through 1.9.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:49:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31944 | WordPress WooCommerce UPS Shipping plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2.4 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31944</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Octolize WooCommerce UPS Shipping – Live Rates and Access Points.This issue affects WooCommerce UPS Shipping – Live Rates and Access Points: from n/a through 2.2.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:49:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31214 | Traccar&amp;#x27;s unrestricted file upload vulnerability in device image upload could lead to remote code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31214</link><description>Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Traccar versions 5.1 through 5.12 allow arbitrary files to be uploaded through the device image upload API. Attackers have full control over the file contents, full control over the directory where the file is stored, full control over the file extension, and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file, an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, XSS, DOS, etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default, allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges, allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default, as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:35:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31461 | Plane Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31461</link><description>Plane, an open-source project management tool, has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in versions prior to 0.17-dev.

x86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section

When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into
the .notes section so that Xen can find the "startup_xen" entry point.
This information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations
are not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notes
section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes
is world-readable.

To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that
are expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in
the .notes section. The values readable in .notes are then identical to
those found in System.map.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 14:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23080 | Joda Time v2.12.5 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormat::wordBased(Locale).</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23080</link><description>Joda Time v2.12.5 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormat::wordBased(Locale).</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31492 | An external control of file name or path vulnerability [CWE-73] in  FortiClientMac version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.10 and below install...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31492</link><description>An external control of file name or path vulnerability [CWE-73] in  FortiClientMac version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.10 and below installer may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via writing a malicious configuration file in /tmp before starting the installation process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:38:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20772 | Adobe Media Encoder 2024 AI file parsing Stack based buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20772</link><description>Media Encoder versions 24.2.1, 23.6.4 and earlier are affected by a Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
