A security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint, allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the key "not so secret". The vulnerability can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted. Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme, where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s` query parameters). This authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/`, which is expected to be most instances in a standard deployment, and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected). This issue has been patched in version 0.50.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 15:15:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48116 | SmarterTools SmarterMail 8495 through 8664 before 8747 allows stored XSS via a crafted description of a Calendar appointment.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48116</link><description>SmarterTools SmarterMail 8495 through 8664 before 8747 allows stored XSS via a crafted description of a Calendar appointment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 14:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50724 | Resque vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting through pathname </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50724</link><description>Resque (pronounced like "rescue") is a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. resque-web in resque versions before 2.1.0 are vulnerable to reflected XSS through the current_queue parameter in the path of the queues endpoint.

While this issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users.

A heap buffer overflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send a specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default on port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codec that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require authentication. Note that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTP protocol, however, the attacker will need a valid credential as the HTTP authentication take places first. This issue has been fixed in version 23.10.2.13-stable, 23.9.4.11-stable, 23.8.6.16-lts and 23.3.16.7-lts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:43:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7018 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data in huggingface/transformers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7018</link><description>Deserialization of Untrusted Data in GitHub repository huggingface/transformers prior to 4.36.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:16:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31092 | WordPress Easy Bet Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31092</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Foxskav Easy Bet.This issue affects Easy Bet: from n/a through 1.0.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:16:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-32128 | WordPress Cryptocurrency Donation Box – Bitcoin &amp;amp; Crypto Donations Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2.7 is vulnerable to SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32128</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Adastra Crypto Cryptocurrency Payment &amp; Donation Box – Accept Payments in any Cryptocurrency on your WP Site for Free.This issue affects Cryptocurrency Payment &amp; Donation Box – Accept Payments in any Cryptocurrency on your WP Site for Free: from n/a through 2.2.7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:16:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-32743 | WordPress AutomateWoo Plugin &amp;lt;= 5.7.1 is vulnerable to SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32743</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in WooCommerce AutomateWoo.This issue affects AutomateWoo: from n/a through 5.7.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:16:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5007 | Student Information System v1.0 - Multiple Authenticated SQL Injections (SQLi)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5007</link><description>Student Information System v1.0 is vulnerable to multiple Authenticated SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy: from 2.8.0 through 2.8.*, from 2.9.0 through 2.9.*, from 2.10.0 through 2.10.4, from 2.11.0 through 2.11.1, 3.0.0.

The known risks include a denial of service due to the WebSocket Proxy accepting any connections, and excessive data transfer due to misuse of the WebSocket ping/pong feature.

2.10 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.5.
2.11 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.2.
3.0 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.1.
3.1 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users are unaffected.
Any users running the Pulsar WebSocket Proxy for 2.8, 2.9, and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:44:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-0011 | Command Execution through Serial Interface of u-blox TOBY-L2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0011</link><description>A flaw in the input validation in TOBY-L2 allows a user to execute arbitrary operating system commands using specifically crafted AT commands. This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT commands.




Exploitation of the vulnerability gives full administrative (root) privileges to the attacker to execute any operating system command on TOBY-L2 which can lead to modification of the behavior of the module itself as well as the components connected with it (depending on its rights on other connected systems). It can further provide the ability to read system level files and hamper the availability of the module as well..




This issue affects TOBY-L2 series: TOBY-L200, TOBY-L201, TOBY-L210, TOBY-L220, TOBY-L280.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:08:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6977 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6977</link><description>This vulnerability enables malicious users to read sensitive files on the server.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:44:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6974 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6974</link><description>A malicious user could use this issue to access internal HTTP(s) servers and in the worst case (ie: aws instance) it could be abuse to get a remote code execution on the victim machine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6975 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6975</link><description>A malicious user could use this issue to get command execution on the vulnerable machine and get access to data &amp; models information.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6976 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6976</link><description>This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files into arbitrary locations on the remote filesystem in the context of the server process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47703 | IBM Security Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47703</link><description>IBM Security Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager 4.3 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information when a detailed technical error message is returned in the browser.
