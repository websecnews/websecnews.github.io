An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker) and/or configure egress firewall rules.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:17:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55200 | BigBlueButton vulnerable to Stored XSS via name of user at Shared Notes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55200</link><description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom.

vulnerability in the CLI of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved could be used to elevate privileges and/or execute unauthorized commands.

When an attacker executes crafted CLI commands, the options are processed via a script in some cases. These scripts are not hardened so injected commands might be executed via the shell, which allows an attacker to perform operations, which they should not be able to do according to their assigned permissions.

This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:



  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2-EVO,
  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2-EVO.

Affected devices allow logins by users for whom the RADIUS server has responded with a reject and required the user to change the password as their password was expired. Therefore the policy mandating the password change is not enforced.
This does not allow users to login with a wrong password, but only with the correct but expired one.

When a device isn't configured with a root password, an attacker can modify a specific file. It's contents will be added to the Junos configuration of the device without being visible. This allows for the addition of any configuration unknown 

to the actual operator, which includes users, IP addresses and other configuration which could allow unauthorized access to the device.
This exploit is persistent across reboots and even zeroization.

The indicator of compromise is a modified /etc/config/-defaults[-flex].conf file. Review that file for unexpected configuration statements, or compare it to an unmodified version which can be extracted from the original Juniper software image file. For details on the extraction procedure please contact Juniper Technical Assistance Center (JTAC).

To restore the device to a trusted initial configuration the system needs to be reinstalled from physical media.

With BGP sharding enabled, triggering route resolution of an indirect next-hop (e.g., an IGP route change over which a BGP route gets resolved), may cause rpd to crash and restart. An attacker causing continuous IGP route churn, resulting in repeated route re-resolution, will increase the likelihood of triggering this issue, leading to a potentially extended DoS condition.

iommu/amd/pgtbl: Fix possible race while increase page table level

The AMD IOMMU host page table implementation supports dynamic page table levels
(up to 6 levels), starting with a 3-level configuration that expands based on
IOVA address. The kernel maintains a root pointer and current page table level
to enable proper page table walks in alloc_pte()/fetch_pte() operations.

The IOMMU IOVA allocator initially starts with 32-bit address and onces its
exhuasted it switches to 64-bit address (max address is determined based
on IOMMU and device DMA capability). To support larger IOVA, AMD IOMMU
driver increases page table level.

But in unmap path (iommu_v1_unmap_pages()), fetch_pte() reads
pgtable-&gt;[root/mode] without lock. So its possible that in exteme corner case,
when increase_address_space() is updating pgtable-&gt;[root/mode], fetch_pte()
reads wrong page table level (pgtable-&gt;mode). It does compare the value with
level encoded in page table and returns NULL. This will result is
iommu_unmap ops to fail and upper layer may retry/log WARN_ON.

  Updates mode (pgtable-&gt;mode += 1)

Since Page table level updates are infrequent and already synchronized with a
spinlock, implement seqcount to enable lock-free read operations on the read path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:51:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39962 | rxrpc: Fix untrusted unsigned subtract</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39962</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Clear tcp_sk(sk)-&gt;fastopen_rsk in tcp_disconnect().

syzbot reported the splat below where a socket had tcp_sk(sk)-&gt;fastopen_rsk
in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state. [0]

syzbot reused the server-side TCP Fast Open socket as a new client before
the TFO socket completes 3WHS:

  1. accept()
  2. connect(AF_UNSPEC)
  3. connect() to another destination

As of accept(), sk-&gt;sk_state is TCP_SYN_RECV, and tcp_disconnect() changes
it to TCP_CLOSE and makes connect() possible, which restarts timers.

Since tcp_disconnect() forgot to clear tcp_sk(sk)-&gt;fastopen_rsk, the
retransmit timer triggered the warning and the intended packet was not
retransmitted.

Let's call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_disconnect().

When igc_led_setup() fails, igc_probe() fails and triggers kernel panic
in free_netdev() since unregister_netdev() is not called. [1]
This behavior can be tested using fault-injection framework, especially
the failslab feature. [2]

Since LED support is not mandatory, treat LED setup failures as
non-fatal and continue probe with a warning message, consequently
avoiding the kernel panic.

iommu/s390: Make attach succeed when the device was surprise removed

When a PCI device is removed with surprise hotplug, there may still be
attempts to attach the device to the default domain as part of tear down
via (__iommu_release_dma_ownership()), or because the removal happens
during probe (__iommu_probe_device()). In both cases zpci_register_ioat()
fails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. This
is because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the
hypervisor is concerned.

Currently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()
fails. This triggers the WARN_ON() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
because attaching to the default domain must never fail.

With the device fenced by the hypervisor no DMAs to or from memory are
possible and the IOMMU translations have no effect. Proceed as if the
registration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up
the device.

This is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since
commit 59bbf596791b ("iommu/s390: Make attach succeed even if the device
is in error state") except that for removal the domain will not be
registered later. This approach was also previously discussed at the
link.

Handle both cases, error state and removal, in a helper which checks if
the error needs to be propagated or ignored. Avoid magic number
condition codes by using the pre-existing, but never used, defines for
PCI load/store condition codes and rename them to reflect that they
apply to all PCI instructions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:58:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39959 | ASoC: amd: acp: Fix incorrect retrival of acp_chip_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39959</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: amd: acp: Fix incorrect retrival of acp_chip_info

Use dev_get_drvdata(dev-&gt;parent) instead of dev_get_platdata(dev)
to correctly obtain acp_chip_info members in the acp I2S driver.
Previously, some members were not updated properly due to incorrect
data access, which could potentially lead to null pointer
dereferences.

This issue was missed in the earlier commit
("ASoC: amd: acp: Fix NULL pointer deref in acp_i2s_set_tdm_slot"),
which only addressed set_tdm_slot(). This change ensures that all
relevant functions correctly retrieve acp_chip_info, preventing
further null pointer dereference issues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:58:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10862 | Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers &amp;lt;= 2.1.3 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection via &amp;#x27;id&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10862</link><description>The Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3.

1. The default token ("authToken") is not changed, or is known to the attacker.
2. The attacker can reach the image renderer endpoint.
This issue affects grafana-image-renderer: from 1.0.0 through 4.0.16.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:32:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7526 | WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software &amp;lt;= 6.6.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion via File Renaming</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7526</link><description>The WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion (via renaming) due to insufficient file path validation in the set_user_profile_image function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.7.

That loader decodes an embedded blob into shellcode, allocates executable heap memory, resolves Windows API functions at runtime, and transfers execution to an in-memory payload. The payload performs anti-analysis checks, gathers host telemetry, encodes the data with a two-stage obfuscation, and attempts HTTPS exfiltration to hard-coded C2 servers or month-based DGA domains. Potential impacts include remote data collection and exfiltration, stealthy in-memory execution and persistence, and potential lateral movement. CCleaner was developed by Piriform, which was acquired by Avast in July 2017; Avast later merged with NortonLifeLock to form the parent company now known as Gen Digital.

The fetched script conditionally loaded follow-on modules that performed extensive ad substitution and malvertising, displayed fake “repair” alerts that redirected users to affiliate programs, and attempted to harvest credentials when users logged in. Injected components enumerate common banner sizes for substitution, replace third-party ad calls, and redirect victim traffic to affiliate landing pages. Potential impacts include user-level code execution in the browser context, large-scale ad fraud and traffic hijacking, credential theft, and exposure to additional payloads delivered by the actor. The compromise was reported on by the maintainer of Web Developer for Chrome on August 2, 2017 and remediated in v0.5.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 22:20:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11535 | MongoDB Connector for BI installation MSI leave ACLs unset on custom installation directories</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11535</link><description>MongoDB Connector for BI installation via MSI on Windows leaves ACLs unset on custom install directories allows Privilege Escalation.This issue affects MongoDB Connector for BI: from 2.0.0 through 2.14.24.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 22:20:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11507 | PHPGurukul Beauty Parlour Management System search-invoices.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11507</link><description>A weakness has been identified in PHPGurukul Beauty Parlour Management System 1.1.

Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, the paella would include and render some user inputs (metadata like title, description, etc.) unfiltered and unmodified. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject and malicious HTML and JavaScript in the player, which would then be executed in the browsers of users watching the prepared media. This can then be used to modify the site or to execute actions in the name of logged-in users. To inject malicious metadata, an attacker needs write access to the system. For example, the ability to upload media and modify metadata. This cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:38:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61906 | Opencast&amp;#x27;s editor accidentally publishes videos/overwrites publications #1626</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61906</link><description>Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, in some situations, Opencast's editor may publish a video without notifying the user. This may lead to users accidentally publishing media not meant for publishing, and thus possibly exposing internal media. This risk of this actually impacting someone is very low, though. This can only be triggered by users with write access to an event. They also have to use the editor, which is usually an action taken if they want to publish media and not something users would use on internal media they do not want to publish. Finally, they have to first click on "Save &amp; Publish" before then selecting the "Save" option. Nevertheless, while very unlikely, this can happen. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:38:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11487 | SourceCodester Farm Management System uploadProduct.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11487</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in SourceCodester Farm Management System 1.0.

Versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 are vulnerable to Command Line Injection attacks on Windows when batch files are executed. In Windows, ``CreateProcess()`` always implicitly spawns ``cmd.exe`` if a batch file (.bat, .cmd, etc.) is being executed even if the application does not specify it via the command line. This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 02:43:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48981 | An insecure implementation of the proprietary protocol DNET in Product CGM MEDICO allows attackers within the intranet to eavesdrop and mani...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48981</link><description>An insecure implementation of the proprietary protocol DNET in Product CGM MEDICO allows attackers within the intranet to eavesdrop and manipulate data on the protocol because encryption is optional for this connection.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 01:27:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61785 | Deno&amp;#x27;s --deny-write check does not prevent permission bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61785</link><description>Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime.

We recommend users upgrade to AWS VPN Client for macOS 5.2.1 or the latest version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 19:50:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36566 | Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.1.0.10, LTS2024 releas...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36566</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.1.0.10, LTS2024 release Versions 7.13.1.0 through 7.13.1.25, LTS 2023 release versions 7.10.1.0 through 7.10.1.50, contain an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability.

A BPv7 bundle with a malformed extension block causes uncontrolled memory allocation inside ION-DTN 4.1.3s, leading to receiver thread termination and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The triggering bundle contains an extension block starting at `0x85070201005bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`. The first byte in the extension block (0x85) indicates a CBOR array of five elements of which the first four are numbers (0x07, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00) but the fifth element is a byte string of length 27 (`0x5bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`). The vulnerability seems to be due to processing the fifth element of the array (i.e., the byte string) as replacing it with a number makes the vulnerability no longer be triggered. While parsing this extension block, ION obtains a very large block length, which in the code in `bei.c`:764) seems to be passed from `blockLength` which is an unsigned int, to a 32 bit signed integer `blkSize`. The unsigned to signed conversion causes `blkSize` to hold the value of -369092043, which is then converted into a 64-bit unsigned value inside `MTAKE(blkSize)`, resulting in an attempt to allocate an unrealistic amount of memory, causing the error. As of time of publication, no known patched versions of BPv7 exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 19:40:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43727 | Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.1.0.10, LTS2024 releas...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43727</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.1.0.10, LTS2024 release Versions 7.13.1.0 through 7.13.1.25, LTS 2023 release versions 7.10.1.0 through 7.10.1.50, contain an incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm vulnerability in the RestAPI.

Prior to version 0.9.4, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerability exists in the `_process_request` function within `src/llamafactory/api/chat.py.` This function is responsible for processing incoming multimodal content, including images, videos, and audio provided via URLs. The function checks if the provided URL is a base64 data URI or a local file path (`os.path.isfile`). If neither is true, it falls back to treating the URL as a web URI and makes a direct HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url, stream=True).raw` without any validation or sanitization of the URL. Version 0.9.4 fixes the underlying issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 19:21:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43913 | Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.3.0.15, LTS2025 releas...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43913</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Domain with Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) of Feature Release versions 7.7.1.0 through 8.3.0.15, LTS2025 release version 8.3.1.0, LTS2024 release versions 7.13.1.0 through 7.13.1.30, LTS 2023 release versions 7.10.1.0 through 7.10.1.60, contain an Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm vulnerability in the DDOS.

Wasmtime 37.0.0 and 37.0.1 have memory leaks in the C/C++ API when using bindings for the `anyref` or `externref` WebAssembly values. This is caused by a regression introduced during the development of 37.0.0 and all prior versions of Wasmtime are unaffected. If `anyref` or `externref` is not used in the C/C++ API then embeddings are also unaffected by the leaky behavior. The `wasmtime` Rust crate is unaffected by this leak.

Development of Wasmtime 37.0.0 included a refactoring in Rust of changing the old `ManuallyRooted` type to a new `OwnedRooted` type. This change was integrated into Wasmtime's C API but left the C API in a state which had memory leaks. Additionally the new ownership semantics around this type were not reflected into the C++ API, making it leak-prone. A short version of the change is that previously `ManuallyRooted`, as the name implies, required manual calls to an "unroot" operation. If this was forgotten then the memory was still cleaned up when the `wasmtime_store_t` itself was destroyed eventually. Documentation of when to "unroot" was sparse and there were already situations prior to 37.0.0 where memory would be leaked until the store was destroyed anyway. All memory, though, was always bound by the store, and destroying the store would guarantee that there were no memory leaks.

In migrating to `OwnedRooted` the usage of the type in Rust changed. A manual "unroot" operation is no longer required and it happens naturally as a destructor of the `OwnedRooted` type in Rust itself. These new resource ownership semantics were not fully integrated into the preexisting semantics of the C/C++ APIs in Wasmtime. A crucial distinction of `OwnedRooted` vs `ManuallyRooted` is that the `OwnedRooted` type allocates host memory outside of the store. This means that if an `OwnedRooted` is leaked then destroying a store does not release this memory and it's a permanent memory leak on the host.

This led to a few distinct, but related, issues arising: A typo in the `wasmtime_val_unroot` function in the C API meant that it did not actually unroot anything. This meant that even if embedders faithfully call the function then memory will be leaked. If a host-defined function returned a `wasmtime_{externref,anyref}_t` value then the value was never unrooted. The C/C++ API no longer has access to the value and the Rust implementation did not unroot. This meant that any values returned this way were never unrooted. The goal of the C++ API of Wasmtime is to encode automatic memory management in the type system, but the C++ API was not updated when `OwnedRooted` was added. This meant that idiomatic usage of the C++ API would leak memory due to a lack of destructors on values.

These issues have all been fixed in a 37.0.2 release of Wasmtime. The implementation of the C and C++ APIs have been updated accordingly and respectively to account for the changes of ownership here. For example `wasmtime_val_unroot` has been fixed to unroot, the Rust-side implementation of calling an embedder-defined function will unroot return values, and the C++ API now has destructors on the `ExternRef`, `AnyRef`, and `Val` types. These changes have been made to the 37.0.x release branch in a non-API-breaking fashion. Changes to the 38.0.0 release branch (and `main` in the Wasmtime repository) include minor API updates to better accommodate the API semantic changes. The only known workaround at this time is to avoid using `externref` and `anyref` in the C/C++ API of Wasmtime. If avoiding those types is not possible then it's required for users to update to mitigate the leak issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 18:52:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11404 | SourceCodester Hotel and Lodge Management System save_tax.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11404</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in SourceCodester Hotel and Lodge Management System 1.0.

staging: rtl8723bs: fix a potential memory leak in rtw_init_cmd_priv()

In rtw_init_cmd_priv(), if `pcmdpriv-&gt;rsp_allocated_buf` is allocated
in failure, then `pcmdpriv-&gt;cmd_allocated_buf` will be not properly
released. Besides, considering there are only two error paths and the
first one can directly return, so we do not need implicitly jump to the
`exit` tag to execute the error handler.

So this patch added `kfree(pcmdpriv-&gt;cmd_allocated_buf);` on the error
path to release the resource and simplified the return logic of
rtw_init_cmd_priv(). As there is no proper device to test with, no runtime
testing was performed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50514 | usb: gadget: f_hid: fix refcount leak on error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50514</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This patch fixes the issue by checking also on DLM_LKF_VALBLK on exflags
is set when copying the lvbptr array instead of if it's just null which
fixes for me the issue.

I think this patch can fix other dlm users as well, depending how they
handle the init, freeing memory handling of sb_lvbptr and don't set
DLM_LKF_VALBLK for some dlm_lock() calls. It might a there could be a
hidden issue all the time. However with checking on DLM_LKF_VALBLK the
user always need to provide a sb_lvbptr non-null value. There might be
more intelligent handling between per ls lvblen, DLM_LKF_VALBLK and
non-null to report the user the way how DLM API is used is wrong but can
be added for later, this will only fix the current behaviour.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50517 | mm/huge_memory: do not clobber swp_entry_t during THP split</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50517</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The problem can be reproduced with the mmtests config
config-workload-stressng-mmap.  It does not always happen and when it
triggers is variable but it has happened on multiple machines.

The intent of commit b653db77350c patch was to avoid the case where
PG_private is clear but folio-&gt;private is not-NULL.  However, THP tail
pages uses page-&gt;private for "swp_entry_t if folio_test_swapcache()" as
stated in the documentation for struct folio.  This patch only clobbers
page-&gt;private for tail pages if the head page was not in swapcache and
warns once if page-&gt;private had an unexpected value.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50518 | parisc: Fix locking in pdc_iodc_print() firmware call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50518</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If creation or finalization of a checkpoint fails due to anomalies in the

This patch replaces the WARN_ONs by nilfs_error, so that a kernel, booted
with panic_on_warn, does not panic.  A nilfs_error is appropriate here to
handle the abnormal filesystem condition.

This also replaces the detected error codes with an I/O error so that
neither of the internal error codes is returned to callers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50520 | drm/radeon: Fix PCI device refcount leak in radeon_atrm_get_bios()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50520</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix null pointer dereference in blk_mq_clear_rq_mapping()

Our syzkaller report a null pointer dereference, root cause is
following:

__blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs
 set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx] = blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs
  blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs
   blk_mq_alloc_rqs

    alloc_pages_node
    // set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx] is still NULL

     drv_tags = set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx];
     // null pointer dereference is triggered
     blk_mq_clear_rq_mapping(drv_tags, ...)

This is because commit 63064be150e4 ("blk-mq:
Add blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs()") merged the two steps:

1) set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx] = blk_mq_alloc_rq_map()
2) blk_mq_alloc_rqs(..., set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx])

into one step:

set-&gt;tags[hctx_idx] = blk_mq_alloc_map_and_rqs()

Since tags is not initialized yet in this case, fix the problem by
checking if tags is NULL pointer in blk_mq_clear_rq_mapping().</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50531 | tipc: fix an information leak in tipc_topsrv_kern_subscr</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50531</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: mlme: fix null-ptr deref on failed assoc

If association to an AP without a link 0 fails, then we crash in
tracing because it assumes that either ap_mld_addr or link 0 BSS
is valid, since we clear sdata-&gt;vif.valid_links and then don't
add the ap_mld_addr to the struct.

Since we clear also sdata-&gt;vif.cfg.ap_addr, keep a local copy of
it and assign it earlier, before clearing valid_links, to fix
this.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50534 | dm thin: Use last transaction&amp;#x27;s pmd-&amp;gt;root when commit failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50534</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Following process may generate a broken btree mixed with fresh and
stale btree nodes, which could get dm thin trapped in an infinite loop
while looking up data block:
 Transaction 1: pmd-&gt;root = A, A-&gt;B-&gt;C   // One path in btree
                pmd-&gt;root = X, X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z   // Copy-up
 Transaction 2: X,Z is updated on disk, Y write failed.
                // Commit failed, dm thin becomes read-only.
                process_bio_read_only
		 dm_thin_find_block
		  __find_block
		   dm_btree_lookup(pmd-&gt;root)
The pmd-&gt;root points to a broken btree, Y may contain stale node
pointing to any block, for example X, which gets dm thin trapped into
a dead loop while looking up Z.

Fix this by setting pmd-&gt;root in __open_metadata(), so that dm thin
will use the last transaction's pmd-&gt;root if commit failed.

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Reset UDMA_CHAN_RT byte counters to prevent overflow

UDMA_CHAN_RT_*BCNT_REG stores the real-time channel bytecount statistics.
These registers are 32-bit hardware counters and the driver uses these
counters to monitor the operational progress status for a channel, when
transferring more than 4GB of data it was observed that these counters
overflow and completion calculation of a operation gets affected and the
transfer hangs indefinitely.

This commit adds changes to decrease the byte count for every complete
transaction so that these registers never overflow and the proper byte
count statistics is maintained for ongoing transaction by the RT counters.

Earlier uc-&gt;bcnt used to maintain a count of the completed bytes at driver
side, since the RT counters maintain the statistics of current transaction
now, the maintenance of uc-&gt;bcnt is not necessary.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50542 | media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50542</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()

syzbot reported use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback() [1].  This
indicates that urb-&gt;context, which contains struct si470x_device
object, is freed when si470x_int_in_callback() is called.

The cause of this issue is that si470x_int_in_callback() is called for
freed urb.

si470x_usb_driver_probe() calls si470x_start_usb(), which then calls
usb_submit_urb() and si470x_start().  If si470x_start_usb() fails,
si470x_usb_driver_probe() doesn't kill urb, but it just frees struct
si470x_device object, as depicted below:

si470x_usb_driver_probe()
  ...
  si470x_start_usb()
    ...
    usb_submit_urb()
    retval = si470x_start()
    return retval
  if (retval &lt; 0)
    free struct si470x_device object, but don't kill urb

This patch fixes this issue by killing urb when si470x_start_usb()
fails and urb is submitted.  If si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is
not submitted, i.e. submitting usb fails, it just frees struct
si470x_device object.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50543 | RDMA/rxe: Fix mr-&amp;gt;map double free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50543</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

                                       and other phy_devices are released
  // similarly, the remove process also has the same problem

The root cause is traced to the phy_device is not disconnected when
removes one r6040 device in r6040_remove_one() or on error handling path
after r6040_mii probed successfully. In r6040_mii_probe(), a net ethernet
device is connected to the first PHY device of mii_bus, in order to
notify the connected driver when the link status changes, which is the
default behavior of the PHY infrastructure to handle everything.
Therefore the phy_device should be disconnected when removes one r6040
device or on error handling path.

Fix it by adding phy_disconnect() when removes one r6040 device or on
error handling path after r6040_mii probed successfully.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50546 | ext4: fix uninititialized value in &amp;#x27;ext4_evict_inode&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50546</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: solo6x10: fix possible memory leak in solo_sysfs_init()

If device_register() returns error in solo_sysfs_init(), the
name allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment of
device_register() says, it should use put_device() to give up
the reference in the error path. So fix this by calling
put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50548 | media: i2c: hi846: Fix memory leak in hi846_parse_dt()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50548</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iolatency: Fix memory leak on add_disk() failures

When a gendisk is successfully initialized but add_disk() fails such as when
a loop device has invalid number of minor device numbers specified,
blkcg_init_disk() is called during init and then blkcg_exit_disk() during
error handling. Unfortunately, iolatency gets initialized in the former but
doesn't get cleaned up in the latter.

This is because, in non-error cases, the cleanup is performed by
del_gendisk() calling rq_qos_exit(), the assumption being that rq_qos
policies, iolatency being one of them, can only be activated once the disk
is fully registered and visible. That assumption is true for wbt and iocost,
but not so for iolatency as it gets initialized before add_disk() is called.

It is desirable to lazy-init rq_qos policies because they are optional
features and add to hot path overhead once initialized - each IO has to walk
all the registered rq_qos policies. So, we want to switch iolatency to lazy
init too. However, that's a bigger change. As a fix for the immediate
problem, let's just add an extra call to rq_qos_exit() in blkcg_exit_disk().
This is safe because duplicate calls to rq_qos_exit() become noop's.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50551 | wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential shift-out-of-bounds in brcmf_fw_alloc_request()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50551</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential shift-out-of-bounds in brcmf_fw_alloc_request()

This patch fixes a shift-out-of-bounds in brcmfmac that occurs in
BIT(chiprev) when a 'chiprev' provided by the device is too large.
It should also not be equal to or greater than BITS_PER_TYPE(u32)
as we do bitwise AND with a u32 variable and BIT(chiprev). The patch
adds a check that makes the function return NULL if that is the case.
Note that the NULL case is later handled by the bus-specific caller,
brcmf_usb_probe_cb() or brcmf_usb_reset_resume(), for example.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

blk-mq: use quiesced elevator switch when reinitializing queues

The hctx's run_work may be racing with the elevator switch when
reinitializing hardware queues. The queue is merely frozen in this
context, but that only prevents requests from allocating and doesn't
stop the hctx work from running. The work may get an elevator pointer
that's being torn down, and can result in use-after-free errors and
kernel panics (example below). Use the quiesced elevator switch instead,
and make the previous one static since it is now only used locally.

tracing/hist: Fix out-of-bound write on 'action_data.var_ref_idx'

When generate a synthetic event with many params and then create a trace
action for it [1], kernel panic happened [2].

It is because that in trace_action_create() 'data-&gt;n_params' is up to
SYNTH_FIELDS_MAX (current value is 64), and array 'data-&gt;var_ref_idx'
keeps indices into array 'hist_data-&gt;var_refs' for each synthetic event
param, but the length of 'data-&gt;var_ref_idx' is TRACING_MAP_VARS_MAX
(current value is 16), so out-of-bound write happened when 'data-&gt;n_params'
more than 16. In this case, 'data-&gt;match_data.event' is overwritten and
eventually cause the panic.

To solve the issue, adjust the length of 'data-&gt;var_ref_idx' to be
SYNTH_FIELDS_MAX and add sanity checks to avoid out-of-bound write.

blk-mq: avoid double -&gt;queue_rq() because of early timeout

David Jeffery found one double -&gt;queue_rq() issue, so far it can
be triggered in VM use case because of long vmexit latency or preempt
latency of vCPU pthread or long page fault in vCPU pthread, then block
IO req could be timed out before queuing the request to hardware but after
calling blk_mq_start_request() during -&gt;queue_rq(), then timeout handler
may handle it by requeue, then double -&gt;queue_rq() is caused, and kernel
panic.

So far, it is driver's responsibility to cover the race between timeout
and completion, so it seems supposed to be solved in driver in theory,
given driver has enough knowledge.

But it is really one common problem, lots of driver could have similar
issue, and could be hard to fix all affected drivers, even it isn't easy
for driver to handle the race. So David suggests this patch by draining
in-progress -&gt;queue_rq() for solving this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50555 | tipc: fix a null-ptr-deref in tipc_topsrv_accept</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50555</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It was caused by srv-&gt;listener that might be set to null by

tipc_topsrv_accept() worker.

srv-&gt;listener is protected by srv-&gt;idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), so add
a check for srv-&gt;listener under srv-&gt;idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_accept() to
avoid the null-ptr-deref. To ensure the lsock is not released during the
tipc_topsrv_accept(), move sock_release() after tipc_topsrv_work_stop()
where it's waiting until the tipc_topsrv_accept worker to be done.

Note that sk_callback_lock is used to protect sk-&gt;sk_user_data instead of
srv-&gt;listener, and it should check srv in tipc_topsrv_listener_data_ready()
instead. This also ensures that no more tipc_topsrv_accept worker will be
started after tipc_conn_close() is called in tipc_topsrv_stop() where it
sets sk-&gt;sk_user_data to null.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53617 | soc: aspeed: socinfo: Add kfree for kstrdup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reject invalid reloc tree root keys with stack dump

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

That ASSERT() makes sure the reloc tree is properly pointed back by its
subvolume tree.

[CAUSE]
After more debugging output, it turns out we had an invalid reloc tree:

  BTRFS error (device loop1): reloc tree mismatch, root 8 has no reloc root, expect reloc root key (-8, 132, 8) gen 17

Note the above root key is (TREE_RELOC_OBJECTID, ROOT_ITEM,
QUOTA_TREE_OBJECTID), meaning it's a reloc tree for quota tree.

But reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes, as for non-subvolume
trees, we just COW the involved tree block, no need to create a reloc
tree since those tree blocks won't be shared with other trees.

Only subvolumes tree can share tree blocks with other trees (thus they
have BTRFS_ROOT_SHAREABLE flag).

Thus this new debug output proves my previous assumption that corrupted
on-disk data can trigger that ASSERT().

[FIX]
Besides the dedicated fix and the graceful exit, also let tree-checker to
check such root keys, to make sure reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53619 | netfilter: conntrack: Avoid nf_ct_helper_hash uses after free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53619</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: Avoid nf_ct_helper_hash uses after free

If nf_conntrack_init_start() fails (for example due to a
register_nf_conntrack_bpf() failure), the nf_conntrack_helper_fini()
clean-up path frees the nf_ct_helper_hash map.

When built with NF_CONNTRACK=y, further netfilter modules (e.g:
netfilter_conntrack_ftp) can still be loaded and call
nf_conntrack_helpers_register(), independently of whether nf_conntrack
initialized correctly. This accesses the nf_ct_helper_hash dangling
pointer and causes a uaf, possibly leading to random memory corruption.

This patch guards nf_conntrack_helper_register() from accessing a freed
or uninitialized nf_ct_helper_hash pointer and fixes possible
uses-after-free when loading a conntrack module.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53620 | md: fix soft lockup in status_resync</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53620</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: fix soft lockup in status_resync

status_resync() will calculate 'curr_resync - recovery_active' to show
user a progress bar like following:

[============&gt;........]  resync = 61.4%

'curr_resync' and 'recovery_active' is updated in md_do_sync(), and
status_resync() can read them concurrently, hence it's possible that
'curr_resync - recovery_active' can overflow to a huge number. In this
case status_resync() will be stuck in the loop to print a large amount
of '=', which will end up soft lockup.

Fix the problem by setting 'resync' to MD_RESYNC_ACTIVE in this case,
this way resync in progress will be reported to user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53621 | memcontrol: ensure memcg acquired by id is properly set up</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53621</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memcontrol: ensure memcg acquired by id is properly set up

In the eviction recency check, we attempt to retrieve the memcg to which
the folio belonged when it was evicted, by the memcg id stored in the
shadow entry.  However, there is a chance that the retrieved memcg is not
the original memcg that has been killed, but a new one which happens to
have the same id.

This is a somewhat unfortunate, but acceptable and rare inaccuracy in the
heuristics.  However, if we retrieve this new memcg between its allocation
and when it is properly attached to the memcg hierarchy, we could run into
the following NULL pointer exception during the memcg hierarchy traversal
done in mem_cgroup_get_nr_swap_pages():

gfs2: Fix possible data races in gfs2_show_options()

Some fields such as gt_logd_secs of the struct gfs2_tune are accessed
without holding the lock gt_spin in gfs2_show_options():

  val = sdp-&gt;sd_tune.gt_logd_secs;
  if (val != 30)
    seq_printf(s, ",commit=%d", val);

And thus can cause data races when gfs2_show_options() and other functions
such as gfs2_reconfigure() are concurrently executed:

  spin_lock(&amp;amp;gt-&gt;gt_spin);
  gt-&gt;gt_logd_secs = newargs-&gt;ar_commit;

To fix these possible data races, the lock sdp-&gt;sd_tune.gt_spin is
acquired before accessing the fields of gfs2_tune and released after these
accesses.

Further changes by Andreas:

mm/swap: fix swap_info_struct race between swapoff and get_swap_pages()

The si-&gt;lock must be held when deleting the si from the available list. 
Otherwise, another thread can re-add the si to the available list, which
can lead to memory corruption.  The only place we have found where this
happens is in the swapoff path.  This case can be described as below:

core 0                       core 1
swapoff

del_from_avail_list(si)      waiting

try lock si-&gt;lock            acquire swap_avail_lock
                             and re-add si into
                             swap_avail_head

acquire si-&gt;lock but missing si already being added again, and continuing
to clear SWP_WRITEOK, etc.

It can be easily found that a massive warning messages can be triggered
inside get_swap_pages() by some special cases, for example, we call
madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT) on blocks of touched memory concurrently, meanwhile,
run much swapon-swapoff operations (e.g.  stress-ng-swap).

However, in the worst case, panic can be caused by the above scene.  In
swapoff(), the memory used by si could be kept in swap_info[] after
turning off a swap.  This means memory corruption will not be caused
immediately until allocated and reset for a new swap in the swapon path. 
A panic message caused: (with CONFIG_PLIST_DEBUG enabled)

net/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of "credit"

if sch_fq is configured with "initial quantum" having values greater than
INT_MAX, the first assignment of "credit" does signed integer overflow to
a very negative value.
In this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the
CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop,
but "credit" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.
Capping "initial quantum" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.

v2: validation of "initial quantum" is done in fq_policy, instead of open
    coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53625 | drm/i915/gvt: fix vgpu debugfs clean in remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53625</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Fix unpinning of pages when an access is present

syzkaller found that the calculation of batch_last_index should use
'start_index' since at input to this function the batch is either empty or
it has already been adjusted to cross any accesses so it will start at the
point we are unmapping from.

Getting this wrong causes the unmap to run over the end of the pages
which corrupts pages that were never mapped. In most cases this triggers
the num pinned debugging:

bpf, arm64: Fixed a BTI error on returning to patched function

When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, BPF trampoline uses BLR to jump
back to the instruction next to call site to call the patched function.
For BTI-enabled kernel, the instruction next to call site is usually
PACIASP, in this case, it's safe to jump back with BLR. But when
the call site is not followed by a PACIASP or bti, a BTI exception
is triggered.

Here is a fault log:

Update ctnetlink to set up the timeout _after_ the IPS_CONFIRMED flag is
set on, otherwise conntrack creation via ctnetlink breaks.

clk: microchip: fix potential UAF in auxdev release callback

Similar to commit 1c11289b34ab ("peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in
adev_release()"), the auxiliary device is not torn down in the correct
order. If auxiliary_device_add() fails, the release callback will be
called twice, resulting in a UAF. Due to timing, the auxdev code in this
driver "took inspiration" from the aforementioned commit, and thus its
bugs too!

Moving auxiliary_device_uninit() to the unregister callback instead
avoids the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53637 | media: i2c: ov772x: Fix memleak in ov772x_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53637</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If it fails to get the devices's MAC address, octep_probe exits while

Move the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of remain_skbs

hif_dev-&gt;remain_skb is allocated and used exclusively in
ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). It is implied that an allocated remain_skb is
processed and subsequently freed (in error paths) only during the next
call of ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

So, if the urbs are deallocated between those two calls due to the device
deinitialization or suspend, it is possible that ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()
is not called next time and the allocated remain_skb is leaked. Our local
Syzkaller instance was able to trigger that.

remain_skb makes sense when receiving two consecutive urbs which are
logically linked together, i.e. a specific data field from the first skb
indicates a cached skb to be allocated, memcpy'd with some data and
subsequently processed in the next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). Urbs
deallocation supposedly makes that link irrelevant so we need to free the
cached skb in those cases.

Fix the leak by introducing a function to explicitly free remain_skb (if
it is not NULL) when the rx urbs have been deallocated. remain_skb is NULL
when it has not been allocated at all (hif_dev struct is kzalloced) or
when it has been processed in next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 ("x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

bpf: Make bpf_refcount_acquire fallible for non-owning refs

This patch fixes an incorrect assumption made in the original
bpf_refcount series [0], specifically that the BPF program calling
bpf_refcount_acquire on some node can always guarantee that the node is
alive. In that series, the patch adding failure behavior to rbtree_add
and list_push_{front, back} breaks this assumption for non-owning
references.

Consider the following program:

  n = bpf_kptr_xchg(&amp;amp;mapval, NULL);
  /* skip error checking */

  bpf_spin_lock(&amp;amp;l);
  if(bpf_rbtree_add(&amp;amp;t, &amp;amp;n-&gt;rb, less)) {
    bpf_refcount_acquire(n);
    /* Failed to add, do something else with the node */
  }
  bpf_spin_unlock(&amp;amp;l);

It's incorrect to assume that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed in this
scenario. bpf_refcount_acquire is being called in a critical section
here, but the lock being held is associated with rbtree t, which isn't
necessarily the lock associated with the tree that the node is already
in. So after bpf_rbtree_add fails to add the node and calls bpf_obj_drop
in it, the program has no ownership of the node's lifetime. Therefore
the node's refcount can be decr'd to 0 at any time after the failing
rbtree_add. If this happens before the refcount_acquire above, the node
might be free'd, and regardless refcount_acquire will be incrementing a
0 refcount.

Later patches in the series exercise this scenario, resulting in the
expected complaint from the kernel (without this patch's changes):

  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

   bpf_refcount_acquire_impl+0xb5/0xc0

  (rest of output snipped)

The patch addresses this by changing bpf_refcount_acquire_impl to use
refcount_inc_not_zero instead of refcount_inc and marking
bpf_refcount_acquire KF_RET_NULL.

For owning references, though, we know the above scenario is not possible
and thus that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed. Some verifier
bookkeeping is added to track "is input owning ref?" for bpf_refcount_acquire
calls and return false from is_kfunc_ret_null for bpf_refcount_acquire on
owning refs despite it being marked KF_RET_NULL.

Existing selftests using bpf_refcount_acquire are modified where
necessary to NULL-check its return value.

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Don't dereference ACPI root object handle

Since the commit referenced in the Fixes: tag below the VMBus client driver
is walking the ACPI namespace up from the VMBus ACPI device to the ACPI
namespace root object trying to find Hyper-V MMIO ranges.

However, if it is not able to find them it ends trying to walk resources of
the ACPI namespace root object itself.
This object has all-ones handle, which causes a NULL pointer dereference
in the ACPI code (from dereferencing this pointer with an offset).

This in turn causes an oops on boot with VMBus host implementations that do
not provide Hyper-V MMIO ranges in their VMBus ACPI device or its
ancestors.
The QEMU VMBus implementation is an example of such implementation.

I guess providing these ranges is optional, since all tested Windows
versions seem to be able to use VMBus devices without them.

Fix this by explicitly terminating the lookup at the ACPI namespace root
object.

Note that Linux guests under KVM/QEMU do not use the Hyper-V PV interface
by default - they only do so if the KVM PV interface is missing or
disabled.

perf trace: Really free the evsel-&gt;priv area

In 3cb4d5e00e037c70 ("perf trace: Free syscall tp fields in
evsel-&gt;priv") it only was freeing if strcmp(evsel-&gt;tp_format-&gt;system,
"syscalls") returned zero, while the corresponding initialization of
evsel-&gt;priv was being performed if it was _not_ zero, i.e. if the tp
system wasn't 'syscalls'.

Just stop looking for that and free it if evsel-&gt;priv was set, which
should be equivalent.

Also use the pre-existing evsel_trace__delete() function.

This resolves these leaks, detected with:

vdpa: Add features attr to vdpa_nl_policy for nlattr length check

The vdpa_nl_policy structure is used to validate the nlattr when parsing
the incoming nlmsg. It will ensure the attribute being described produces
a valid nlattr pointer in info-&gt;attrs before entering into each handler
in vdpa_nl_ops.

That is to say, the missing part in vdpa_nl_policy may lead to illegal
nlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.

This patch adds the missing nla_policy for vdpa features attr to avoid
such bugs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53653 | media: amphion: fix REVERSE_INULL issues reported by coverity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53653</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-af: Add validation before accessing cgx and lmac

with the addition of new MAC blocks like CN10K RPM and CN10KB
RPM_USX, LMACs are noncontiguous and CGX blocks are also
noncontiguous. But during RVU driver initialization, the driver
is assuming they are contiguous and trying to access
cgx or lmac with their id which is resulting in kernel panic.

This patch fixes the issue by adding proper checks.

rcu: Avoid stack overflow due to __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick() being kprobe-ed

Registering a kprobe on __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick() can cause kernel
stack overflow as shown below. This issue can be reproduced by enabling
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL and booting the kernel with argument "nohz_full=",
and then giving the following commands at the shell prompt:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
  # echo 'p:mp1 __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick' &gt;&gt; kprobe_events
  # echo 1 &gt; events/kprobes/enable

This commit therefore adds __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick() to the kprobes
blacklist using NOKPROBE_SYMBOL().

drivers/perf: hisi: Don't migrate perf to the CPU going to teardown

The driver needs to migrate the perf context if the current using CPU going
to teardown. By the time calling the cpuhp::teardown() callback the
cpu_online_mask() hasn't updated yet and still includes the CPU going to
teardown. In current driver's implementation we may migrate the context
to the teardown CPU and leads to the below calltrace:

spi: bcm-qspi: return error if neither hif_mspi nor mspi is available

If neither a "hif_mspi" nor "mspi" resource is present, the driver will
just early exit in probe but still return success. Apart from not doing
anything meaningful, this would then also lead to a null pointer access
on removal, as platform_get_drvdata() would return NULL, which it would
then try to dereference when trying to unregister the spi master.

Fix this by unconditionally calling devm_ioremap_resource(), as it can
handle a NULL res and will then return a viable ERR_PTR() if we get one.

The "return 0;" was previously a "goto qspi_resource_err;" where then
ret was returned, but since ret was still initialized to 0 at this place
this was a valid conversion in 63c5395bb7a9 ("spi: bcm-qspi: Fix
use-after-free on unbind"). The issue was not introduced by this commit,
only made more obvious.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53659 | iavf: Fix out-of-bounds when setting channels on remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53659</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: Fix out-of-bounds when setting channels on remove

If we set channels greater during iavf_remove(), and waiting reset done
would be timeout, then returned with error but changed num_active_queues

num_active_queues is greater than tx/rx_rings[] allocated actually.

The reason for the warning is twofold. One is due to the kthread
cpu_map_kthread_run() is stopped prematurely. Another one is
__cpu_map_ring_cleanup() doesn't handle skb mode and treats skbs in
ptr_ring as XDP frames.

Prematurely-stopped kthread will be fixed by the preceding patch and
ptr_ring will be empty when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() is called. But
as the comments in __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() said, handling and freeing
skbs in ptr_ring as well to "catch any broken behaviour gracefully".</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53661 | bnxt: avoid overflow in bnxt_get_nvram_directory()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53661</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: cdc_ncm: Deal with too low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize

Currently in cdc_ncm_check_tx_max(), if dwNtbOutMaxSize is lower than
the calculated "min" value, but greater than zero, the logic sets
tx_max to dwNtbOutMaxSize. This is then used to allocate a new SKB in
cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame() where all the data is handled.

For small values of dwNtbOutMaxSize the memory allocated during
alloc_skb(dwNtbOutMaxSize, GFP_ATOMIC) will have the same size, due to
how size is aligned at alloc time:
	size = SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size);
        size += SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info));
Thus we hit the same bug that we tried to squash with
commit 2be6d4d16a084 ("net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero")

Low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize do not cause an issue presently because at
alloc_skb() time more memory (512b) is allocated than required for the
SKB headers alone (320b), leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b)
for CDC data (172b).

However, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to
one of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',
increasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger
(344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer
fits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).

Consequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:

Through the vmcore, I found it's because in tracing_read_pipe(),
ring_buffer_empty_cpu() found some buffer is not empty but then it
cannot read anything due to "rb_num_of_entries() == 0" always true,
Then it infinitely loop the procedure due to user buffer not been
filled, see following code path:

  tracing_read_pipe() {
    ... ...
    waitagain:
      tracing_wait_pipe() // 1. find non-empty buffer here
      trace_find_next_entry_inc()  // 2. loop here try to find an entry
        __find_next_entry()
          ring_buffer_empty_cpu();  // 3. find non-empty buffer
          peek_next_entry()  // 4. but peek always return NULL
            ring_buffer_peek()
              rb_buffer_peek()
                rb_get_reader_page()
                  // 5. because rb_num_of_entries() == 0 always true here
                  //    then return NULL
      // 6. user buffer not been filled so goto 'waitgain'
      //    and eventually leads to an deadloop in kernel!!!
  }

By some analyzing, I found that when resetting ringbuffer, the 'entries'
of its pages are not all cleared (see rb_reset_cpu()). Then when reducing
the ringbuffer, and if some reduced pages exist dirty 'entries' data, they
will be added into 'cpu_buffer-&gt;overrun' (see rb_remove_pages()), which
cause wrong 'overrun' count and eventually cause the deadloop issue.

To fix it, we need to clear every pages in rb_reset_cpu().</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53669 | tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53669</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP

David Ahern reported crashes in skb_copy_ubufs() caused by TCP tx zerocopy
using hugepages, and skb length bigger than ~68 KB.

skb_copy_ubufs() assumed it could copy all payload using up to
MAX_SKB_FRAGS order-0 pages.

This assumption broke when BIG TCP was able to put up to 512 KB per skb.

We did not hit this bug at Google because we use CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45
and limit gso_max_size to 180000.

A solution is to use higher order pages if needed.

v2: add missing __GFP_COMP, or we leak memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53670 | nvme-core: fix dev_pm_qos memleak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53670</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref

[BUG]
Syzbot reported several warning triggered inside
lookup_inline_extent_backref().

[CAUSE]
As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at
least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not
be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.
inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already
exist)

[ENHANCEMENT]
After the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree
leaf to help debug.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53673 | Bluetooth: hci_event: call disconnect callback before deleting conn</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53673</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: Fix memory leak in devm_clk_notifier_register()

devm_clk_notifier_register() allocates a devres resource for clk
notifier but didn't register that to the device, so the notifier didn't
get unregistered on device detach and the allocated resource was leaked.

Fix the issue by registering the resource through devres_add().

This issue was found with kmemleak on a Chromebook.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53675 | scsi: ses: Fix possible desc_ptr out-of-bounds accesses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53675</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix buffer overflow in lio_target_nacl_info_show()

The function lio_target_nacl_info_show() uses sprintf() in a loop to print
details for every iSCSI connection in a session without checking for the
buffer length. With enough iSCSI connections it's possible to overflow the
buffer provided by configfs and corrupt the memory.

This patch replaces sprintf() with sysfs_emit_at() that checks for buffer
boundries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53677 | drm/i915: Fix memory leaks in i915 selftests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53677</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If fbdev is not initialized for some reason - in practice on platforms

suspend, fix this up. While at it add an assert that suspending fbdev
only happens with the display present.

wifi: mt7601u: fix an integer underflow

Fix an integer underflow that leads to a null pointer dereference in
'mt7601u_rx_skb_from_seg()'. The variable 'dma_len' in the URB packet
could be manipulated, which could trigger an integer underflow of
'seg_len' in 'mt7601u_rx_process_seg()'. This underflow subsequently
causes the 'bad_frame' checks in 'mt7601u_rx_skb_from_seg()' to be
bypassed, eventually leading to a dereference of the pointer 'p', which
is a null pointer.

Ensure that 'dma_len' is greater than 'min_seg_len'.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

NFSD: Avoid calling OPDESC() with ops-&gt;opnum == OP_ILLEGAL

OPDESC() simply indexes into nfsd4_ops[] by the op's operation
number, without range checking that value. It assumes callers are
careful to avoid calling it with an out-of-bounds opnum value.

nfsd4_decode_compound() is not so careful, and can invoke OPDESC()
with opnum set to OP_ILLEGAL, which is 10044 -- well beyond the end
of nfsd4_ops[].</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53681 | bcache: Fix __bch_btree_node_alloc to make the failure behavior consistent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53681</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because in drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c:701 xgene_hwmon_probe(),
ioremap and memremap is not released, which may cause a leak.

To fix this, ioremap and memremap is modified to devm_ioremap and
devm_memremap.

xfrm: Zero padding when dumping algos and encap

When copying data to user-space we should ensure that only valid
data is copied over.  Padding in structures may be filled with
random (possibly sensitve) data and should never be given directly
to user-space.

This patch fixes the copying of xfrm algorithms and the encap
template in xfrm_user so that padding is zeroed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:33:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53685 | tun: Fix memory leak for detached NAPI queue.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53685</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tun: Fix memory leak for detached NAPI queue.

syzkaller reported [0] memory leaks of sk and skb related to the TUN
device with no repro, but we can reproduce it easily with:

  struct ifreq ifr = {}
  int fd_tun, fd_tmp;
  char buf[4] = {};

  fd_tun = openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/net/tun", O_WRONLY, 0);
  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_TUN | IFF_NAPI | IFF_MULTI_QUEUE;
  ioctl(fd_tun, TUNSETIFF, &amp;amp;ifr);

  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_DETACH_QUEUE;
  ioctl(fd_tun, TUNSETQUEUE, &amp;amp;ifr);

  fd_tmp = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_PACKET, 0);
  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_UP;
  ioctl(fd_tmp, SIOCSIFFLAGS, &amp;amp;ifr);

  write(fd_tun, buf, sizeof(buf));
  close(fd_tun);

If we enable NAPI and multi-queue on a TUN device, we can put skb into
tfile-&gt;sk.sk_write_queue after the queue is detached.  We should prevent
it by checking tfile-&gt;detached before queuing skb.

Note this must be done under tfile-&gt;sk.sk_write_queue.lock because write()
and ioctl(IFF_DETACH_QUEUE) can run concurrently.  Otherwise, there would
be a small race window:

  write()                             ioctl(IFF_DETACH_QUEUE)
  `- tun_get_user                     `- __tun_detach
     |- if (tfile-&gt;detached)             |- tun_disable_queue
     |  `-&gt; false                        |  `- tfile-&gt;detached = tun
     |                                   `- tun_queue_purge
     |- spin_lock_bh(&amp;amp;queue-&gt;lock)
     `- __skb_queue_tail(queue, skb)

Another solution is to call tun_queue_purge() when closing and
reattaching the detached queue, but it could paper over another
problems.  Also, we do the same kind of test for IFF_NAPI_FRAGS.

In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, `Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes to memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust memory and cause a denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send incomplete multipart headers to trigger high memory use, leading to process termination (OOM) or severe slowdown. The effect scales with request size limits and concurrency. All applications handling multipart uploads may be affected. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 cap per-part header size (e.g., 64 KiB). As a workaround, restrict maximum request sizes at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61771 | Rack&amp;#x27;s multipart parser buffers large non‑file fields entirely in memory, enabling DoS (memory exhaustion)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61771</link><description>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, ``Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory usage. Impact scales with request size and concurrency, potentially leading to worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead. All Rack applications processing multipart form submissions are affected. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g., 2 MiB). Workarounds include restricting maximum request body size at the web-server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`) and validating and rejecting unusually large form fields at the application level.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:53:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6215 | HP Sure Start IFD Protection - BIOS Security Update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6215</link><description>A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HP Sure Start’s protection of the Intel Flash Descriptor in certain HP PC products, which might allow security bypass, arbitrary code execution, loss of integrity or confidentiality, or denial of service.

In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, `Rack::Multipart::Parser` buffers the entire multipart preamble (bytes before the first boundary) in memory without any size limit. A client can send a large preamble followed by a valid boundary, causing significant memory use and potential process termination due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. Remote attackers can trigger large transient memory spikes by including a long preamble in multipart/form-data requests.

Before version 0.11.0rc2, the API key support in vLLM performs validation using a method that was vulnerable to a timing attack. API key validation uses a string comparison that takes longer the more characters the provided API key gets correct. Data analysis across many attempts could allow an attacker to determine when it finds the next correct character in the key sequence. Deployments relying on vLLM's built-in API key validation are vulnerable to authentication bypass using this technique.
