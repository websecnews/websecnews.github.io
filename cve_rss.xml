Due to improper sanitization of web app properties (such as name, description, shortcuts), web apps were able to inject additional lines into XDG Desktop Entries (on Linux) and `AppInfo.ini` (on PortableApps.com). This allowed malicious web apps to introduce keys like `Exec`, which could run arbitrary code when the affected web app was launched. This vulnerability affects all Linux and PortableApps.com users of all PWAsForFirefox versions up to (excluding) 2.12.0. Windows and macOS users are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in commit `9932d4b` which has been included in release in v2.12.0. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes. All Linux and PortableApps.com users are advised to update to this version as soon as possible. It is also recommended for Windows and macOS users to update to this version, as it contains additional fixes related to properties sanitization. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34062 | tqdm CLI arguments injection attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34062</link><description>tqdm is an open source progress bar for Python and CLI. Any optional non-boolean CLI arguments (e.g. `--delim`, `--buf-size`, `--manpath`) are passed through python's `eval`, allowing arbitrary code execution. This issue is only locally exploitable and had been addressed in release version 4.66.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34063 | Degraded secret zeroization capabilities in vodozemac</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34063</link><description>vodozemac is an implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust. Versions 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 of vodozemac have degraded secret zeroization capabilities, due to changes in third-party cryptographic dependencies (the Dalek crates), which moved secret zeroization capabilities behind a feature flag and defaulted this feature to off. The degraded zeroization capabilities could result in the production of more memory copies of encryption secrets and secrets could linger in memory longer than necessary. This marginally increases the risk of sensitive data exposure. This issue has been addressed in version 0.6.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33914 | WordPress Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin &amp;lt;= 2.6.9.1 - Broken Access Control on Post Duplication vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33914</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Exclusive Addons Exclusive Addons Elementor.This issue affects Exclusive Addons Elementor: from n/a through 2.6.9.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33915 | WordPress Debug Log Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3.1 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33915</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Bowo Debug Log Manager.This issue affects Debug Log Manager: from n/a through 2.3.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33919 | WordPress RomethemeKit For Elementor plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4.1 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33919</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Rometheme RomethemeKit For Elementor.This issue affects RomethemeKit For Elementor: from n/a through 1.4.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33920 | WordPress Democracy Poll  plugin &amp;lt;= 6.0.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33920</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Kama Democracy Poll.This issue affects Democracy Poll: from n/a through 6.0.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33921 | WordPress ReviewX plugin &amp;lt;= 1.6.21 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33921</link><description>Broken Access Control vulnerability in ReviewX.This issue affects ReviewX: from n/a through 1.6.21.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33923 | WordPress SP Project &amp;amp; Document Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 4.69 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33923</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Smartypants SP Project &amp; Document Manager.This issue affects SP Project &amp; Document Manager : from n/a through 4.69.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33925 | WordPress Embed Google Fonts plugin &amp;lt;= 3.1.0 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33925</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Adrian Mörchen Embed Google Fonts.This issue affects Embed Google Fonts: from n/a through 3.1.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33929 | WordPress Directorist plugin &amp;lt;= 7.8.6 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33929</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in wpWax Directorist.This issue affects Directorist: from n/a through 7.8.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33931 | WordPress JW Player for WordPress plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33931</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in ilGhera JW Player for WordPress.This issue affects JW Player for WordPress: from n/a through 2.3.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33937 | WordPress Progressive WordPress (PWA) plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1.13 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33937</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Nico Martin Progressive WordPress (PWA).This issue affects Progressive WordPress (PWA): from n/a through 2.1.13.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35701 | Apache Hive: Arbitrary command execution via JDBC driver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35701</link><description>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive.

The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability. 

The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23912 | Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Merge DICOM Toolkit C/C++ on Windows.

In affected versions if a model has been made available for editing through the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module or `ModelViewSet`, and the `permission` argument on `FieldPanel` has been used to further restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check on the individual field, allowing them to update its value. This vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability as follows: 1.For models registered through `ModelViewSet`, register the model as a snippet instead; 2. For settings models, place the restricted fields in a separate settings model, and configure permission at the model level.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 07:16:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32962 | XML signature verification bypass due improper verification of signature / signature spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32962</link><description>xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's ``. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() =&gt; undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:57:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3490 | The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wprm-recipe-roundup-item shortcode in...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3490</link><description>The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wprm-recipe-roundup-item shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 9.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:47:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2405 | Float menu &amp;lt; 6.0.1 - Menu Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2405</link><description>The Float menu  WordPress plugin before 6.0.1 does not have CSRF check in its bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin delete arbitrary menu via a CSRF attack.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3471 | Button Generator &amp;lt; 3.0 - Button Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3471</link><description>The Button Generator  WordPress plugin before 3.0 does not have CSRF check in place when bulk deleting, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete buttons via a CSRF attack</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3472 | Modal Window &amp;lt; 5.3.10 - Modal Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3472</link><description>The Modal Window  WordPress plugin before 5.3.10 does not have CSRF check in place when bulk deleting modals, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete them via a CSRF attack</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3474 | Wow Skype Buttons &amp;lt; 4.0.4 - Button Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3474</link><description>The Wow Skype Buttons WordPress plugin before 4.0.4 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such as deleting buttons via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3475 | Sticky Buttons &amp;lt; 3.2.4 - Button Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3475</link><description>The Sticky Buttons  WordPress plugin before 3.2.4 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such as deleting buttons via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3476 | Side Menu Lite &amp;lt; 4.2.1 - Menu Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3476</link><description>The Side Menu Lite  WordPress plugin before 4.2.1 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such as deleting buttons via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3477 | Popup Box &amp;lt; 2.2.7 - Popup Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3477</link><description>The Popup Box  WordPress plugin before 2.2.7 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such as deleting popups via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3478 | Herd Effects &amp;lt; 5.2.7 - Effect Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3478</link><description>The Herd Effects  WordPress plugin before 5.2.7 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such as deleting effects via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3481 | Counter Box &amp;lt; 1.2.4 - Counter Deletion via CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3481</link><description>The Counter Box  WordPress plugin before 1.2.4 does not have CSRF checks in some bulk actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins perform unwanted actions, such deleting counters via CSRF attacks</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 06:26:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51631 | D-Link DIR-X3260 prog.cgi SetUsersSettings Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51631</link><description>D-Link DIR-X3260 prog.cgi SetUsersSettings Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.

virtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc table

When use_dma_api and premapped are true, then the do_unmap is false.

Because the do_unmap is false, vring_unmap_extra_packed is not called by
detach_buf_packed.

  if (unlikely(vq-&gt;do_unmap)) {
                curr = id;
                for (i = 0; i &lt; state-&gt;num; i++) {
                        vring_unmap_extra_packed(vq,
                                                 &amp;amp;vq-&gt;packed.desc_extra[curr]);
                        curr = vq-&gt;packed.desc_extra[curr].next;
                }
  }

So the indirect desc table is not unmapped. This causes the unmap leak.

So here, we check vq-&gt;use_dma_api instead. Synchronously, dma info is
updated based on use_dma_api judgment

This bug does not occur, because no driver use the premapped with
indirect.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27067 | xen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27067</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race when detecting delalloc ranges during fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

This however introduced a race that makes us miss delalloc ranges for
file regions that are currently holes, so the caller of fiemap will not
be aware that there's data for some file regions. This can be quite
serious for some use cases - for example in coreutils versions before 9.0,
the cp program used fiemap to detect holes and data in the source file,
copying only regions with data (extents or delalloc) from the source file
to the destination file in order to preserve holes (see the documentation
for its --sparse command line option). This means that if cp was used
with a source file that had delalloc in a hole, the destination file could
end up without that data, which is effectively a data loss issue, if it
happened to hit the race described below.

The race happens like this:

1) Fiemap is called, without the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC flag, for a file that
   has delalloc in the file range [64M, 65M[, which is currently a hole;

2) Fiemap locks the inode in shared mode, then starts iterating the
   inode's subvolume tree searching for file extent items, without having
   the whole fiemap target range locked in the inode's io tree - the
   change introduced recently by commit b0ad381fa769 ("btrfs: fix
   deadlock with fiemap and extent locking"). It only locks ranges in
   the io tree when it finds a hole or prealloc extent since that
   commit;

3) Note that fiemap clones each leaf before using it, and this is to
   avoid deadlocks when locking a file range in the inode's io tree and
   the fiemap buffer is memory mapped to some file, because writing
   to the page with btrfs_page_mkwrite() will wait on any ordered extent
   for the page's range and the ordered extent needs to lock the range
   and may need to modify the same leaf, therefore leading to a deadlock
   on the leaf;

4) While iterating the file extent items in the cloned leaf before
   finding the hole in the range [64M, 65M[, the delalloc in that range
   is flushed and its ordered extent completes - meaning the corresponding
   file extent item is in the inode's subvolume tree, but not present in
   the cloned leaf that fiemap is iterating over;

5) When fiemap finds the hole in the [64M, 65M[ range by seeing the gap in
   the cloned leaf (or a file extent item with disk_bytenr == 0 in case
   the NO_HOLES feature is not enabled), it will lock that file range in
   the inode's io tree and then search for delalloc by checking for the
   EXTENT_DELALLOC bit in the io tree for that range and ordered extents
   (with btrfs_find_delalloc_in_range()). But it finds nothing since the
   delalloc in that range was already flushed and the ordered extent
   completed and is gone - as a result fiemap will not report that there's
   delalloc or an extent for the range [64M, 65M[, so user space will be
   mislead into thinking that there's a hole in that range.

This could actually be sporadically triggered with test case generic/094
from fstests, which reports a missing extent/delalloc range like this:

their allocation. So this patch add these deallocations in the
corresponding paths.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27389 | pstore: inode: Only d_invalidate() is needed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27389</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pstore: inode: Only d_invalidate() is needed

Unloading a modular pstore backend with records in pstorefs would
trigger the dput() double-drop warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2569 at fs/dcache.c:762 dput.part.0+0x3f3/0x410

Using the combo of d_drop()/dput() (as mentioned in
Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst) isn't the right approach here, and
leads to the reference counting problem seen above. Use d_invalidate()
and update the code to not bother checking for error codes that can
never happen.

ipv6: mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down()

As discussed in the past (commit 2d3916f31891 ("ipv6: fix skb drops
in igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()")) I think the
synchronize_net() call in ipv6_mc_down() is not needed.

Under load, synchronize_net() can last between 200 usec and 5 ms.

KASAN seems to agree as well.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27391 | wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27391</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added

Commit 09ed8bfc5215 ("wilc1000: Rename workqueue from "WILC_wq" to
"NETDEV-wq"") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to
set the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver
needs only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we
add an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a
new one. This can be observed with the following commands:

for i in $(seq 0 10)
do
  iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed
  iw dev wlan1 del
done
ps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan

 39 kworker/R-wlan0
 98 kworker/R-wlan1
102 kworker/R-wlan1
105 kworker/R-wlan1
108 kworker/R-wlan1
111 kworker/R-wlan1
114 kworker/R-wlan1
117 kworker/R-wlan1
120 kworker/R-wlan1
123 kworker/R-wlan1
126 kworker/R-wlan1
129 kworker/R-wlan1

Fix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in
wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to
set it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, so
enforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the
name with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27392 | nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27392</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()

When nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct
nvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()
for the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in
KASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with
proposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by
skipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23597 | Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in TvRock 0.9t8a.

USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command

The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values
in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when
creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves
division and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of
these values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device, it
could happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by the
syzbot fuzzer.

Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if
either the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID
information is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a
negative error code when initialization fails; currently it always
returns 0 (even when there is an error).</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27060 | thunderbolt: Fix NULL pointer dereference in tb_port_update_credits()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27060</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

leds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify

Commit d5e01266e7f5 ("leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link
speed mode") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUP
mode in commit cee4bd16c319 ("leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck
NETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUP on dev rename") and moved it to a generic function.

This changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the dev
from the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but in
the new implementation with the generic function, the dev in
trigger_data is used instead.

This is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact
that the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as the
new one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and saved
in the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).

On calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this
cause a kernel panic.

To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after the
new net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTER
case) and correctly parse the new dev.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28775 | IBM WebSphere Automation cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28775</link><description>IBM WebSphere Automation 1.7.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

Currently, if there are multiple registrations of the same pin on the

The problem is, that in both dpll_xa_ref_dpll_del() and
dpll_xa_ref_pin_del() registration is only removed from list in case the
reference count drops to zero. That is wrong, the registration has to
be removed always.

To fix this, remove the registration from the list and free

NFS: Fix nfs_netfs_issue_read() xarray locking for writeback interrupt

The loop inside nfs_netfs_issue_read() currently does not disable
interrupts while iterating through pages in the xarray to submit
for NFS read.  This is not safe though since after taking xa_lock,
another page in the mapping could be processed for writeback inside
an interrupt, and deadlock can occur.  The fix is simple and clean
if we use xa_for_each_range(), which handles the iteration with RCU
while reducing code complexity.

The problem is easily reproduced with the following test:
 mount -o vers=3,fsc 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs
 dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file1.bin bs=4096 count=1
 echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
 dd if=/mnt/nfs/file1.bin of=/dev/null
 umount /mnt/nfs

cifs: Fix writeback data corruption

cifs writeback doesn't correctly handle the case where
cifs_extend_writeback() hits a point where it is considering an additional
folio, but this would overrun the wsize - at which point it drops out of
the xarray scanning loop and calls xas_pause().  The problem is that
xas_pause() advances the loop counter - thereby skipping that page.

What needs to happen is for xas_reset() to be called any time we decide we
don't want to process the page we're looking at, but rather send the
request we are building and start a new one.

Fix this by copying and adapting the netfslib writepages code as a
temporary measure, with cifs writeback intending to be offloaded to
netfslib in the near future.

This also fixes the issue with the use of filemap_get_folios_tag() causing
retry of a bunch of pages which the extender already dealt with.

This can be tested by creating, say, a 64K file somewhere not on cifs
(otherwise copy-offload may get underfoot), mounting a cifs share with a
wsize of 64000, copying the file to it and then comparing the original file
and the copy:

        dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/64K bs=64k count=1
        mount //192.168.6.1/test /mnt -o user=...,pass=...,wsize=64000
        cp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K
        cmp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K

Without the fix, the cmp fails at position 64000 (or shortly thereafter).</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27037 | clk: zynq: Prevent null pointer dereference caused by kmalloc failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27037</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free

In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed
in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL
after dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,
for example, in the following call chain:

budget_register
  |-&gt; dvb_dmxdev_init
        |-&gt; dvb_register_device
  |-&gt; dvb_dmxdev_release
        |-&gt; dvb_unregister_device

                          |-&gt; kref_put

When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev-&gt;dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in
dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in
dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to
kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27044 | drm/amd/display: Fix potential NULL pointer dereferences in &amp;#x27;dcn10_set_output_transfer_func()&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27044</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()

When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf
bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.
This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means
that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller
size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by
libbpf writing out of bounds.

The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the
feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)
macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this
fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()
macro.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27051 | cpufreq: brcmstb-avs-cpufreq: add check for cpufreq_cpu_get&amp;#x27;s return value</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27051</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend

When the system is suspended while audio is active, the
sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() is invoked to reset the pipelines since during
suspend the DSP is turned off, streams will be re-started after resume.

If the firmware crashes during while audio is running (or when we reset
the stream before suspend) then the sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state()
will fail with IPC error and the state change is interrupted.
This will cause misalignment between the kernel and firmware state on next
DSP boot resulting errors returned by firmware for IPC messages, eventually
failing the audio resume.
On stream close the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be
corrected on the next DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic.

If sof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() then
state parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case.

Treat a forced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by
ignoring error on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be
consistent with the state the firmware will have after the next boot.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 13:11:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31412 | Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in CX-Programmer included in CX-One CXONE-AL[][]D-V4 Ver. 9.81 or lower.

The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by: 1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued. 2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued. Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed. An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 10:52:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32967 | Zitadel exposes internal database user name and host information</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32967</link><description>Zitadel is an open source identity management system.

Most codebases define assertion macros which compile to a no-op on non-debug builds. If assertions are the only line of defense against untrusted input, the software may be exposed to attacks that leverage the lack of proper input checks. In detail, in the `nimble_scanlist_update()` function below, `len` is checked in an assertion and subsequently used in a call to `memcpy()`. If an attacker is able to provide a larger `len` value while assertions are compiled-out, they can write past the end of the fixed-length `e-&gt;ad` buffer.

Thorvald reported a WARNING [1]. And the root cause is below race:

hugetlb_dup_vma_private() and hugetlb_vm_op_open() are called outside

nilfs2: fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_type

The size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array in the fs/nilfs2/dir.c file is
defined as "S_IFMT &gt;&gt; S_SHIFT", but the nilfs_set_de_type() function,
which uses this array, specifies the index to read from the array in the
same way as "(mode &amp; S_IFMT) &gt;&gt; S_SHIFT".

static void nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode
 *inode)
{
	umode_t mode = inode-&gt;i_mode;

	de-&gt;file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode &amp; S_IFMT)&gt;&gt;S_SHIFT]; // oob
}

However, when the index is determined this way, an out-of-bounds (OOB)
error occurs by referring to an index that is 1 larger than the array size
when the condition "mode &amp; S_IFMT == S_IFMT" is satisfied.  Therefore, a
patch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array should be applied to prevent
OOB errors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26982 | Squashfs: check the inode number is not the invalid value of zero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26982</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: check the inode number is not the invalid value of zero

Syskiller has produced an out of bounds access in fill_meta_index().

That out of bounds access is ultimately caused because the inode
has an inode number with the invalid value of zero, which was not checked.

The reason this causes the out of bounds access is due to following
sequence of events:

1. Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())
   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error
   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.
   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,
   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).

2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another
   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index
   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index
   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because
   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number
is not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.

bootconfig: use memblock_free_late to free xbc memory to buddy

On the time to free xbc memory in xbc_exit(), memblock may has handed
over memory to buddy allocator. So it doesn't make sense to free memory
back to memblock. memblock_free() called by xbc_exit() even causes UAF bugs
on architectures with CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK disabled like x86.
Following KASAN logs shows this case.

This patch fixes the xbc memory free problem by calling memblock_free()
in early xbc init error rewind path and calling memblock_free_late() in
xbc exit path to free memory to buddy allocator.

Adding any sort of useful debug usually makes it go away, so I hand
wrote the function in a line, and debugged the asm.

Every so often pt-&gt;memory-&gt;ptrs is NULL. This ptrs ptr is set in
the nv50_instobj_acquire called from nvkm_kmap.

If Thread A and Thread B both get to nv50_instobj_acquire around
the same time, and Thread A hits the refcount_set line, and in
lockstep thread B succeeds at refcount_inc_not_zero, there is a
chance the ptrs value won't have been stored since refcount_set
is unordered. Force a memory barrier here, I picked smp_mb, since
we want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by a read.

irrespective of the MEMBLOCK_NOMAP ranges. Such MEMBLOCK_NOMAP regions
should not be saved during hibernation.

This problem was introduced by changes to the pfn_valid() logic in
commit a7d9f306ba70 ("arm64: drop pfn_valid_within() and simplify
pfn_valid()").

Similar to other architectures, drop the !can_set_direct_map() check in

KVM: x86/mmu: Write-protect L2 SPTEs in TDP MMU when clearing dirty status

Check kvm_mmu_page_ad_need_write_protect() when deciding whether to
write-protect or clear D-bits on TDP MMU SPTEs, so that the TDP MMU
accounts for any role-specific reasons for disabling D-bit dirty logging.

Specifically, TDP MMU SPTEs must be write-protected when the TDP MMU is
being used to run an L2 (i.e. L1 has disabled EPT) and PML is enabled.
KVM always disables PML when running L2, even when L1 and L2 GPAs are in
the some domain, so failing to write-protect TDP MMU SPTEs will cause
writes made by L2 to not be reflected in the dirty log.

KVM: x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributes

Fix KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and trigger
KASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest.

When memory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will have
specific properties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used when
the attributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those the
specific huge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also not
allowed to span adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memory
could be mapped as huge.

What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by an array of arrays
'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs. Each index of
lpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for a specific
supported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specific huge
page (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arrays include
indices for unaligned head and tail huge pages.

Preventing huge pages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered by
incrementing the count in head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot is
allocated, but disallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributes
has to be done in a more complicated way. During the
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVM updates lpage_info for each memslot in
the range that has mismatched attributes. KVM does this a memslot at a
time, and marks a special bit, KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_info
for any huge page. This bit is essentially a permanently elevated count.
So huge pages will not be mapped for the GFN at that page size if the
count is elevated in either case: a huge head or tail page unaligned to
the memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is set because it has mixed
attributes.

To determine whether a huge page has consistent attributes, the
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checks an xarray to make sure it
consistently has the incoming attribute. Since level - 1 huge pages are
aligned to level huge pages, it employs an optimization. As long as the
level - 1 huge pages are checked first, it can just check these and assume
that if each level - 1 huge page contained within the level sized huge
page is not mixed, then the level size huge page is not mixed. This
optimization happens in the helper hugepage_has_attrs().

Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info array representing page size
'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tail page of size level,
the array for level - 1  will not contain an entry for each GFN at page
size level. The level - 1 array will only contain an index for any
unaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can be a
smaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1
kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read.

In some cases of head and tail pages where an overflow could happen,
callers skip the operation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is not
required to prevent huge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots that
are smaller than the 1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). In
this case the huge page is both the head and tail page. The issue can be
observed simply by compiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC and
running the selftest “private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces the
output like the following:

BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in hugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110

It is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (in the bug case
also the tail page) should be expected to have KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.
It is not functionally required, as the unal

KVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBS

Drop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation is
architecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and because
exposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leak
host kernel addresses to the guest.

Bug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits of
IA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.g
fixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()
stores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.

Bug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero value
for PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even if
the guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptive
PEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to the
guest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,
i.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.

Bug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upper
bits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, and
intel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE
either.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of what
KVM requests.

Bug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters set
by the host, as "Updated Memory Access Info Group" records information
that might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.

Bug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at least
zeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guest
to read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling "LBR Entries"
records.

Disable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity of
the LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will be
non-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.

Note!  This will break live migration, but trying to make KVM play nice
with live migration would be quite complicated, wouldn't be guaranteed to
work (i.e. KVM might still kill/confuse the guest), and it's not clear
that there are any publicly available VMMs that support adaptive PEBS,
let alone live migrate VMs that support adaptive PEBS, e.g. QEMU doesn't
support PEBS in any capacity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26993 | fs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26993</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set

Off-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are
incorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of
PDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added
one.

When doing the power negotiation, TCPM relies on the "nr_snk_pdo" as
the size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities
of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong RDO
might be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over
voltage or over current (than expected).

"nr_src_pdo" is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source
role. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when
filling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as
in Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong Rp
level might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner
port.

When ncm function is working and then stop usb0 interface for link down,
eth_stop() is called. At this piont, accidentally if usb transport error
should happen in usb_ep_enable(), 'in_ep' and/or 'out_ep' may not be enabled.

After that, ncm_disable() is called to disable for ncm unbind
but gether_disconnect() is never called since 'in_ep' is not enabled.

As the result, ncm object is released in ncm unbind
but 'dev-&gt;port_usb' associated to 'ncm-&gt;port' is not NULL.

And when ncm bind again to recover netdev, ncm object is reallocated
but usb0 interface is already associated to previous released ncm object.

Therefore, once usb0 interface is up and eth_start_xmit() is called,
released ncm object is dereferrenced and it might cause use-after-free memory.

This patch addresses the issue by checking if 'ncm-&gt;netdev' is not NULL at
ncm_disable() to call gether_disconnect() to deassociate 'dev-&gt;port_usb'.
It's more reasonable to check 'ncm-&gt;netdev' to call gether_connect/disconnect
rather than check 'ncm-&gt;port.in_ep-&gt;enabled' since it might not be enabled
but the gether connection might be established.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26997 | usb: dwc2: host: Fix dereference issue in DDMA completion flow.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26997</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying it

The circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown()
under the spin lock. However, the PM or other timer based callbacks
may still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer
is not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking
the buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions, some on the
buffer pointer), it's better to have both aligned, i.e. buffer pointer
to be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same, meaning it's empty.
This will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as
reported recently in 8250 case:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000cf5

The proposed change will prevent -&gt;start_tx() to be called during

serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood

The mitigation was intended to stop the irq completely. That may be
better than a hard lock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway
if you're using pmac_zilog as a serial console:

ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood !
BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, swapper/0

That's because the pr_err() call in pmz_receive_chars() results in
pmz_console_write() attempting to lock a spinlock already locked in
pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y, this produces a fatal
BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one in struct uart_port.

Even when it's not fatal, the serial port rx function ceases to work.
Also, the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU, as can be
seen in the bug report linked below.

A web search for other reports of the error message "pmz: rx irq flood"
didn't produce anything. So I don't think this code is needed any more.
Remove it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27000 | serial: mxs-auart: add spinlock around changing cts state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27000</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

While vmk80xx does have endpoint checking implemented, some things
can fall through the cracks. Depending on the hardware model,
URBs can have either bulk or interrupt type, and current version
of vmk80xx_find_usb_endpoints() function does not take that fully
into account. While this warning does not seem to be too harmful,
at the very least it will crash systems with 'panic_on_warn' set on
them.

Fix the issue found by Syzkaller [1] by somewhat simplifying the
endpoint checking process with usb_find_common_endpoints() and
ensuring that only expected endpoint types are present.

to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device
to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another
thread, e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting

The first thread is walking the clk tree and calling
clk_pm_runtime_get() to power on devices required to read the clk
hardware via struct clk_ops::is_enabled(). This thread holds the clk
prepare_lock, and is trying to runtime PM resume a device, when it finds
that the device is in the process of resuming so the thread schedule()s
away waiting for the device to finish resuming before continuing. The
second thread is runtime PM resuming the same device, but the runtime
resume callback is calling clk_prepare(), trying to grab the
prepare_lock waiting on the first thread.

This is a classic ABBA deadlock. To properly fix the deadlock, we must
never runtime PM resume or suspend a device with the clk prepare_lock
held. Actually doing that is near impossible today because the global
prepare_lock would have to be dropped in the middle of the tree, the
device runtime PM resumed/suspended, and then the prepare_lock grabbed
again to ensure consistency of the clk tree topology. If anything
changes with the clk tree in the meantime, we've lost and will need to
start the operation all over again.

Luckily, most of the time we're simply incrementing or decrementing the
runtime PM count on an active device, so we don't have the chance to
schedule away with the prepare_lock held. Let's fix this immediate
problem that can be

interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated

The icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock
mutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately
protect access to icc_node::req_list.

The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while
only holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while only
holding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),
and icc_put().

Example A:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&amp;amp;icc_bw_lock);
                                     icc_put(path_b)
                                       mutex_lock(&amp;amp;icc_lock);
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...
                                       hlist_del(...
        

Example B:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&amp;amp;icc_bw_lock);
                                     path_b = of_icc_get()
                                       of_icc_get_by_index()
                                         mutex_lock(&amp;amp;icc_lock);
                                         path_find()
                                           path_init()
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...
                                             hlist_add_head(...
        

Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating
icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't
perform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from the
original lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.

thermal/debugfs: Add missing count increment to thermal_debug_tz_trip_up()

The count field in struct trip_stats, representing the number of times
the zone temperature was above the trip point, needs to be incremented
in thermal_debug_tz_trip_up(), for two reasons.

First, if a trip point is crossed on the way up for the first time,
thermal_debug_update_temp() called from update_temperature() does
not see it because it has not been added to trips_crossed[] array
in the thermal zone's struct tz_debugfs object yet.  Therefore, when
thermal_debug_tz_trip_up() is called after that, the trip point's
count value is 0, and the attempt to divide by it during the average
temperature computation leads to a divide error which causes the kernel
to crash.  Setting the count to 1 before the division by incrementing it
fixes this problem.

Second, if a trip point is crossed on the way up, but it has been
crossed on the way up already before, its count value needs to be
incremented to make a record of the fact that the zone temperature is
above the trip now.  Without doing that, if the mitigations applied
after crossing the trip cause the zone temperature to drop below its
threshold, the count will not be updated for this episode at all and
the average temperature in the trip statistics record will be somewhat
higher than it should be.

s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing

A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the
online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent
state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail
with return code ENODEV.

The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after
a wait for final device state completed, but before the result state
is evaluated.

Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between
determining final state and checking result state.

Note that since:

commit 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")

path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,
resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27010 | net/sched: Fix mirred deadlock on device recursion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Example setup (eth0-&gt;eth0) to recreate
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth0 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

Another example(eth0-&gt;eth1-&gt;eth0) to recreate
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth0 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth1

tc qdisc add dev eth1 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth1 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

We fix this by adding an owner field (CPU id) to struct Qdisc set after
root qdisc is entered. When the softirq enters it a second time, if the
qdisc owner is the same CPU, the packet is dropped to break the loop.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27011 | netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27011</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path

The delete set command does not rely on the transaction object for
element removal, therefore, a combination of delete element + delete set
from the abort path could result in restoring twice the refcount of the
mapping.

Check for inactive element in the next generation for the delete element
command in the abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bit
has been already cleared. This is similar to the activate logic using
the set walk iterator.

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set-&gt;ops-&gt;walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the
next generation bit.

The splat below shows an object in mappings memleak:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv-&gt;state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

netfilter: flowtable: incorrect pppoe tuple

pppoe traffic reaching ingress path does not match the flowtable entry
because the pppoe header is expected to be at the network header offset.
This bug causes a mismatch in the flow table lookup, so pppoe packets
enter the classical forwarding path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27016 | netfilter: flowtable: validate pppoe header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27016</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable: validate pppoe header

Ensure there is sufficient room to access the protocol field of the
PPPoe header. Validate it once before the flowtable lookup, then use a
helper function to access protocol field.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27017 | netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: walk over current view on netlink dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27017</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: walk over current view on netlink dump

The generation mask can be updated while netlink dump is in progress.
The pipapo set backend walk iterator cannot rely on it to infer what
view of the datastructure is to be used. Add notation to specify if user
wants to read/update the set.

Based on patch from Florian Westphal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27018 | netfilter: br_netfilter: skip conntrack input hook for promisc packets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27018</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: br_netfilter: skip conntrack input hook for promisc packets

For historical reasons, when bridge device is in promisc mode, packets
that are directed to the taps follow bridge input hook path. This patch
adds a workaround to reset conntrack for these packets.

Jianbo Liu reports warning splats in their test infrastructure where
cloned packets reach the br_netfilter input hook to confirm the
conntrack object.

Scratch one bit from BR_INPUT_SKB_CB to annotate that this packet has
reached the input hook because it is passed up to the bridge device to
reach the taps.

r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal

Binding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic
because on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this
by avoiding the device-managed LED functions.

Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even
if registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects
this and is a no-op in this case.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:40:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26940 | drm/vmwgfx: Create debugfs ttm_resource_manager entry only if needed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26940</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: qcom: at803x: fix kernel panic with at8031_probe

On reworking and splitting the at803x driver, in splitting function of
at803x PHYs it was added a NULL dereference bug where priv is referenced
before it's actually allocated and then is tried to write to for the
is_1000basex and is_fiber variables in the case of at8031, writing on
the wrong address.

Fix this by correctly setting priv local variable only after
at803x_probe is called and actually allocates priv in the phydev struct.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26943 | nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26943</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure

The kcalloc() in nouveau_dmem_evict_chunk() will return null if
the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
src_pfns, dst_pfns or dma_addrs, the null pointer dereference bugs
will happen.

Moreover, the GPU is going away. If the kcalloc() fails, we could not
evict all pages mapping a chunk. So this patch adds a __GFP_NOFAIL
flag in kcalloc().

Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory,
this patch switches kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid
failing allocations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26944 | btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free in do_zone_finish()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26944</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer

The previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer-&gt;device being
dereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to
instead get the device from ctx-&gt;wg. This semantically makes more sense
too, since ctx-&gt;wg-&gt;peer_allowedips.seq is compared with
ctx-&gt;allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a
defence in depth provision against freed peers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26951 | wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26951</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list

If all peers are removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), rather than setting
peer_list to empty, the peer is added to a temporary list with a head on
the stack of wg_peer_remove_all(). If a netlink dump is resumed and the
cursored peer is one that has been removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), it
will iterate from that peer and then attempt to dump freed peers.

Fix this by instead checking peer-&gt;is_dead, which was explictly created
for this purpose. Also move up the device_update_lock lockdep assertion,
since reading is_dead relies on that.

It can be reproduced by a small script like:

    echo "Setting config..."
    ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
    wg setconf wg0 /big-config
    (
            while true; do
                    echo "Showing config..."
                    wg showconf wg0 &gt; /dev/null
            done
    ) &amp;
    sleep 4
    wg setconf wg0 &lt;(printf "[Peer]\nPublicKey=$(wg genkey)\n")

nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()

Fix a bug where nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status when
searching and inserting the specified block both fail inconsistently.  If
this inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then an
unexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.

This prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting a
read into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check
for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26956 | nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26956</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings

Patch series "nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()".

This resolves a kernel BUG reported by syzbot.  Since there are two
flaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.

The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I think
both fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file data
to a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.

There are two flaws involved in this issue.

The first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using
btree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routine
nilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadata
corruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causes
nilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,
causing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.

The second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in
this inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()
or others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,
resulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()
failing.

This fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL
when a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the
conflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,
code -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during the
block lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error and
converted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26957 | s390/zcrypt: fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26957</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/zcrypt: fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects

Tests with hot-plugging crytpo cards on KVM guests with debug
kernel build revealed an use after free for the load field of
the struct zcrypt_card. The reason was an incorrect reference
handling of the zcrypt card object which could lead to a free
of the zcrypt card object while it was still in use.

This is because we're completing the nfs_direct_request twice in a row.

The source of this is when we have our commit requests to submit, we
process them and send them off, and then in the completion path for the
commit requests we have

if (nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds))
	nfs_direct_write_complete(dreq);

However since we're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes have
one that completes before we submit the next one, so we end up calling
complete on the nfs_direct_request twice.

The only other place we use nfs_generic_commit_list() is in
__nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this call in a

nfs_commit_begin();
nfs_commit_end();

Which is a common pattern for this style of completion handling, one
that is also repeated in the direct code with get_dreq()/put_dreq()
calls around where we process events as well as in the completion paths.

Fix this by using the same pattern for the commit requests.

Before with my 200 node rocksdb stress running this warning would pop
every 10ish minutes.  With my patch the stress test has been running for
several hours without popping.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26959 | Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix btnxpuart_close</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26959</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8&lt;-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE".

swapoff-&gt;try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si-&gt;inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si-&gt;inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-&gt; count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-&gt; count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()-&gt;folio_free_swap()-&gt;delete_from_swap_cache()-&gt;
put_swap_folio()-&gt;free_swap_slot()-&gt;swapcache_free_entries()-&gt;
swap_entry_free()-&gt;swap_range_free()-&gt;
...
WRITE_ONCE(si-&gt;inuse_pages, si-&gt;inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

Handle the proper resource release in the RCU callback function
mac802154_llsec_key_del_rcu().

Note that if llsec_lookup_key() finds a key, it gets a refcount via
llsec_key_get() and locally copies key id from key_entry (which is a
list element). So it's safe to call llsec_key_put() and free the list
entry after the RCU grace period elapses.

dm-raid456, md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with reshape

For raid456, if reshape is still in progress, then IO across reshape
position will wait for reshape to make progress. However, for dm-raid,
in following cases reshape will never make progress hence IO will hang:

1) the array is read-only;
2) MD_RECOVERY_WAIT is set;
3) MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set;

After commit c467e97f079f ("md/raid6: use valid sector values to determine
if an I/O should wait on the reshape") fix the problem that IO across
reshape position doesn't wait for reshape, the dm-raid test

This is because reshape can't make progress.

For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register new sync_thread
doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more:

1) If array is read-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs;
2) md/raid never set MD_RECOVERY_WAIT;
3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn't hold
   'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue by
   sysfs api 'sync_action'.

However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problem in dm-raid yet. This
patch on the one hand make sure raid_message() can't change
sync_thread() through raid_message() after presuspend(), on the other
hand detect the above 3 cases before wait for IO do be done in
dm_suspend(), and let dm-raid requeue those IO.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26963 | usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26963</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: ubifs_symlink: Fix memleak of inode-&gt;i_link in error path

For error handling path in ubifs_symlink(), inode will be marked as
bad first, then iput() is invoked. If inode-&gt;i_link is initialized by
fscrypt_encrypt_symlink() in encryption scenario, inode-&gt;i_link won't
be freed by callchain ubifs_free_inode -&gt; fscrypt_free_inode in error
handling path, because make_bad_inode() has changed 'inode-&gt;i_mode' as
'S_IFREG'.
Following kmemleak is easy to be reproduced by injecting error in
ubifs_jnl_update() when doing symlink in encryption scenario:
 unreferenced object 0xffff888103da3d98 (size 8):
  comm "ln", pid 1692, jiffies 4294914701 (age 12.045s)

There are two ways fixing it:
 1. Remove make_bad_inode() in error handling path. We can do that
    because ubifs_evict_inode() will do same processes for good
    symlink inode and bad symlink inode, for inode-&gt;i_nlink checking
    is before is_bad_inode().
 2. Free inode-&gt;i_link before marking inode bad.
Method 2 is picked, it has less influence, personally, I think.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26973 | fat: fix uninitialized field in nostale filehandles</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26973</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery

During the PCI AER system's error recovery process, the kernel driver
may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's
memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function
scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout, and the reset_data
structure will be freed. However, this data structure is used for
completion notification after the restart is completed, which leads
to a UAF bug.

This results in a KFENCE bug notice.

  BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]
  Use-after-free read at 0x00000000bc56fddf (in kfence-#142):
  adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]
  process_one_work+0x173/0x340

To resolve this race condition, the memory associated to the container
of the work_struct is freed on the worker if the timeout expired,
otherwise on the function that schedules the worker.
The timeout detection can be done by checking if the caller is
still waiting for completion or not by using completion_done() function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26975 | powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26975</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

A NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPL

This is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on such
platforms even if 'defaults_msr' is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8
("powercap: intel_rapl: Allow probing without CPUID match"). Thus the
MMIO RAPL rp-&gt;priv-&gt;defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework.

KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed

Always flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its
completion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.
KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the
last reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to the
associated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed
vCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded
before the callback completes.

Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from
async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will
result in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()
finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes:

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with "wakeup all"
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

drm/vmwgfx: Unmap the surface before resetting it on a plane state

Switch to a new plane state requires unreferencing of all held surfaces.
In the work required for mob cursors the mapped surfaces started being
cached but the variable indicating whether the surface is currently
mapped was not being reset. This leads to crashes as the duplicated
state, incorrectly, indicates the that surface is mapped even when
no surface is present. That's because after unreferencing the surface
it's perfectly possible for the plane to be backed by a bo instead of a
surface.

Reset the surface mapped flag when unreferencing the plane state surface
to fix null derefs in cleanup. Fixes crashes in KDE KWin 6.0 on Wayland:

The system was under memory stress where driver was not able to allocate an
SRB to carry out error recovery of cable pull.  The failure to flush causes
upper layer to start modifying scsi_cmnd.  When the system frees up some
memory, the subsequent cable pull trigger another command flush. At this
point the driver access a null pointer when attempting to DMA unmap the
SGL.

Add a check to make sure commands are flush back on session tear down to
prevent the null pointer access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26932 | usb: typec: tcpm: fix double-free issue in tcpm_port_unregister_pd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26932</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix deadlock in port "disable" sysfs attribute

The show and store callback routines for the "disable" sysfs attribute
file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub
device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub
to remove it or change its configuration:

	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the
	hub interface to be removed, which requires the port device
	to be removed, and device_del() waits until all outstanding
	sysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The
	lock can't be released until then.

	But the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return
	until after it has acquired the lock.

The resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling
sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not
to wait for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the
removal to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call,
there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at
any moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it
first by calling hub_get().</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26934 | USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26934</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in
drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is
the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 ("scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe ("scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function "pairs" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26937 | drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26937</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking

Originally, with strict in order execution, we could complete execution
only when the queue was empty. Preempt-to-busy allows replacement of an
active request that may complete before the preemption is processed by
HW. If that happens, the request is retired from the queue, but the
queue_priority_hint remains set, preventing direct submission until
after the next CS interrupt is processed.

This preempt-to-busy race can be triggered by the heartbeat, which will
also act as the power-management barrier and upon completion allow us to
idle the HW. We may process the completion of the heartbeat, and begin
parking the engine before the CS event that restores the
queue_priority_hint, causing us to fail the assertion that it is MIN.

drm/i915/bios: Tolerate devdata==NULL in intel_bios_encoder_supports_dp_dual_mode()

If we have no VBT, or the VBT didn't declare the encoder
in question, we won't have the 'devdata' for the encoder.
Instead of oopsing just bail early.

We won't be able to tell whether the port is DP++ or not,
but so be it.

drm/i915/vma: Fix UAF on destroy against retire race

Object debugging tools were sporadically reporting illegal attempts to
free a still active i915 VMA object when parking a GT believed to be idle.

[161.359441] ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: ffff88811643b958 object type: i915_active hint: __i915_vma_active+0x0/0x50 [i915]

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref-&gt;tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 ("drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
("drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm-&gt;mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().
v5: Replace "tile" with "GT" across commit description (Rodrigo),
