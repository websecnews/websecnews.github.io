mm/vma: add give_up_on_oom option on modify/merge, use in uffd release

Currently, if a VMA merge fails due to an OOM condition arising on commit
merge or a failure to duplicate anon_vma's, we report this so the caller
can handle it.

However there are cases where the caller is only ostensibly trying a
merge, and doesn't mind if it fails due to this condition.

Since we do not want to introduce an implicit assumption that we only
actually modify VMAs after OOM conditions might arise, add a 'give up on
oom' option and make an explicit contract that, should this flag be set, we
absolutely will not modify any VMAs should OOM arise and just bail out.

Since it'd be very unusual for a user to try to vma_modify() with this flag
set but be specifying a range within a VMA which ends up being split (which
can fail due to rlimit issues, not only OOM), we add a debug warning for
this condition.

The motivating reason for this is uffd release - syzkaller (and Pedro
Falcato's VERY astute analysis) found a way in which an injected fault on
allocation, triggering an OOM condition on commit merge, would result in
uffd code becoming confused and treating an error value as if it were a VMA
pointer.

To avoid this, we make use of this new VMG flag to ensure that this never
occurs, utilising the fact that, should we be clearing entire VMAs, we do
not wish an OOM event to be reported to us.

Many thanks to Pedro Falcato for his excellent analysis and Jann Horn for
his insightful and intelligent analysis of the situation, both of whom were
instrumental in this fix.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37761 | drm/xe: Fix an out-of-bounds shift when invalidating TLB</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37761</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix an out-of-bounds shift when invalidating TLB

When the size of the range invalidated is larger than
rounddown_pow_of_two(ULONG_MAX),
The function macro roundup_pow_of_two(length) will hit an out-of-bounds
shift [1].

Use a full TLB invalidation for such cases.
v2:
- Use a define for the range size limit over which we use a full
  TLB invalidation. (Lucas)
- Use a better calculation of the limit.

drm/imagination: take paired job reference

For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until
the fragment job has finished with it.

The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being
prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the
geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.

Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:

The cause of this is:

- drm_prime_gem_destroy calls dma_buf_put(dma_buf) which releases the
  reference to the shared dma_buf. The reference count is 0, so the
  dma_buf is destroyed, which in turn decrements the corresponding
  amdgpu_bo reference count to 0, and the amdgpu_bo is destroyed -
  calling drm_gem_object_release then dma_resv_fini (which destroys the
  reservation object), then finally freeing the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_bo obj-&gt;bo.base.resv is now a dangling pointer to the memory
  formerly allocated to the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_gem_object_del calls ttm_bo_put(&amp;amp;nvbo-&gt;bo) which calls
  ttm_bo_release, which schedules ttm_bo_delayed_delete.

- ttm_bo_delayed_delete runs and dereferences the dangling resv pointer,
  resulting in a general protection fault.

Fix this by moving the drm_prime_gem_destroy call from
nouveau_gem_object_del to nouveau_bo_del_ttm. This ensures that it will
be run after ttm_bo_delayed_delete.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37766 | drm/amd/pm: Prevent division by zero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37766</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler

struct rdma_cm_id has member "struct work_struct net_work"
that is reused for enqueuing cma_netevent_work_handler()s
onto cma_wq.

Below crash[1] can occur if more than one call to
cma_netevent_callback() occurs in quick succession,
which further enqueues cma_netevent_work_handler()s for the
same rdma_cm_id, overwriting any previously queued work-item(s)
that was just scheduled to run i.e. there is no guarantee
the queued work item may run between two successive calls
to cma_netevent_callback() and the 2nd INIT_WORK would overwrite
the 1st work item (for the same rdma_cm_id), despite grabbing
id_table_lock during enqueue.

Also drgn analysis [2] indicates the work item was likely overwritten.

Fix this by moving the INIT_WORK() to __rdma_create_id(),
so that it doesn't race with any existing queue_work() or
its worker thread.

&gt;&gt;&gt; trace[8]["work"]
*(struct work_struct *)0xffff92577d0a21d8 = {

	},
	.func = (work_func_t)cma_netevent_work_handler+0x0 = 0xffffffffc2cec280,
}

Suspicion is that pwq is NULL:
&gt;&gt;&gt; trace[8]["pwq"]
(struct pool_workqueue *)

In process_one_work(), pwq is assigned from:
struct pool_workqueue *pwq = get_work_pwq(work);

and get_work_pwq() is:
static struct pool_workqueue *get_work_pwq(struct work_struct *work)
{
 	unsigned long data = atomic_long_read(&amp;amp;work-&gt;data);

 	if (data &amp; WORK_STRUCT_PWQ)
 		return work_struct_pwq(data);
 	else
 		return NULL;
}

WORK_STRUCT_PWQ is 0x4:
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(prog['WORK_STRUCT_PWQ']))
Object(prog, 'enum work_flags', value=4)

But work-&gt;data is 536870912 which is 0x20000000.
So, get_work_pwq() returns NULL and we crash in process_one_work():
3168	strscpy(worker-&gt;desc, pwq-&gt;wq-&gt;name, WORKER_DESC_LEN);

slab: ensure slab-&gt;obj_exts is clear in a newly allocated slab page

ktest recently reported crashes while running several buffered io tests
with __alloc_tagging_slab_alloc_hook() at the top of the crash call stack.
The signature indicates an invalid address dereference with low bits of
slab-&gt;obj_exts being set. The bits were outside of the range used by
page_memcg_data_flags and objext_flags and hence were not masked out
by slab_obj_exts() when obtaining the pointer stored in slab-&gt;obj_exts.
The typical crash log looks like this:

Investigation indicates that these bits are already set when we allocate

why these crashes start happening only recently but regardless of the
reason, not initializing a field that gets used later is wrong. Fix it

The root cause is that pages in bvec are coalesced across a folio bounary.
The refcount of all non-slab folios should be increased to ensure
p9_releas_pages can put them correctly.

isofs: Prevent the use of too small fid

syzbot reported a slab-out-of-bounds Read in isofs_fh_to_parent. [1]

The handle_bytes value passed in by the reproducing program is equal to 12.
In handle_to_path(), only 12 bytes of memory are allocated for the structure
file_handle-&gt;f_handle member, which causes an out-of-bounds access when
accessing the member parent_block of the structure isofs_fid in isofs,
because accessing parent_block requires at least 16 bytes of f_handle.
Here, fh_len is used to indirectly confirm that the value of handle_bytes
is greater than 3 before accessing parent_block.

i2c: cros-ec-tunnel: defer probe if parent EC is not present

When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent
device will not be found, leading to NULL pointer dereference.

That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then
loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device).

drm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check

The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers
returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This
could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.

This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is
valid before dereferencing them.

net: ti: icss-iep: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request

The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.
Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),
results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.

To fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw
function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when
disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request
structure, as its contents are irrelevant in this case.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37786 | net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37786</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure

If complete = true in dsa_tree_setup(), it means that we are the last
switch of the tree which is successfully probing, and we should be
setting up all switches from our probe path.

After "complete" becomes true, dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any
subsequent function may fail. If that happens, the entire tree setup is
in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing
(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's
dst-&gt;ports, and maybe dst-&gt;rtable), and switch N failed to probe, ending
the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.

If switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed
from dst-&gt;ports. However, the dst-&gt;rtable elements pointing to its ports,
as created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to
use-after-free if dereferenced.

If dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely
possible because that is where ds-&gt;ops-&gt;setup() is, we get a kasan
report like this:

The simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its
entirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating
it even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,
because dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already
exists in dst-&gt;rtable, allocating if not.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in
dsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be
called from the tree setup error path.

In my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added
dsa_link elements to dst-&gt;rtable. Prior to that, each switch had its own
ds-&gt;rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree
is potentially persistent memory.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37787 | net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37787</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond &amp;&amp; !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.

To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:37:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37788 | cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37788</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path

In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a
memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,
but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow
goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from
(i-1)th iteration are freed.

ath12k_mac_op_tx() is called after ieee80211_do_stop(), ahvif-&gt;ah can be
NULL, leading the ath12k_warn(ahvif-&gt;ah,...) call in this function to
trigger the NULL deref below.

Do not set 'HCI_UART_PROTO_READY' before call 'hci_uart_register_dev()'.
Possible race is when someone calls 'hci_tty_uart_close()' after this bit
is set, but 'hci_uart_register_dev()' wasn't done. This leads to access
to uninitialized fields. To fix it let's set this bit after device was
registered (as before patch c411c62cc133) and to fix previous problem let's
add one more bit in addition to 'HCI_UART_PROTO_READY' which allows to
perform power up without original bit set (pls see commit c411c62cc133).

misc: pci_endpoint_test: Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error

After devm_request_irq() fails with error in pci_endpoint_test_request_irq(),
the pci_endpoint_test_free_irq_vectors() is called assuming that all IRQs
have been released.

However, some requested IRQs remain unreleased, so there are still
/proc/irq/* entries remaining, and this results in WARN() with the
following message:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 202 at fs/proc/generic.c:719 remove_proc_entry +0x190/0x19c

To solve this issue, set the number of remaining IRQs to test-&gt;num_irqs,
and release IRQs in advance by calling pci_endpoint_test_release_irq().

KVM: x86: Acquire SRCU in KVM_GET_MP_STATE to protect guest memory accesses

Acquire a lock on kvm-&gt;srcu when userspace is getting MP state to handle a
rather extreme edge case where "accepting" APIC events, i.e. processing
pending INIT or SIPI, can trigger accesses to guest memory.  If the vCPU
is in L2 with INIT *and* a TRIPLE_FAULT request pending, then getting MP
state will trigger a nested VM-Exit by way of -&gt;check_nested_events(), and
emuating the nested VM-Exit can access guest memory.

The splat was originally hit by syzkaller on a Google-internal kernel, and
reproduced on an upstream kernel by hacking the triple_fault_event_test
selftest to stuff a pending INIT, store an MSR on VM-Exit (to generate a
memory access on VMX), and do vcpu_mp_state_get() to trigger the scenario.

sctp: detect and prevent references to a freed transport in sendmsg

sctp_sendmsg() re-uses associations and transports when possible by
doing a lookup based on the socket endpoint and the message destination
address, and then sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() sets the selected transport in
all the message chunks to be sent.

There's a possible race condition if another thread triggers the removal
of that selected transport, for instance, by explicitly unbinding an
address with setsockopt(SCTP_SOCKOPT_BINDX_REM), after the chunks have
been set up and before the message is sent. This can happen if the send
buffer is full, during the period when the sender thread temporarily
releases the socket lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf().

This causes the access to the transport data in
sctp_outq_select_transport(), when the association outqueue is flushed,
to result in a use-after-free read.

This change avoids this scenario by having sctp_transport_free() signal
the freeing of the transport, tagging it as "dead". In order to do this,
the patch restores the "dead" bit in struct sctp_transport, which was
removed in
commit 47faa1e4c50e ("sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport").

Then, in the scenario where the sender thread has released the socket
lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf(), the bit is checked again after
re-acquiring the socket lock to detect the deletion. This is done while
holding a reference to the transport to prevent it from being freed in
the process.

If the transport was deleted while the socket lock was relinquished,
sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() will return -EAGAIN to let userspace retry the
send.

The bug was found by a private syzbot instance (see the error report [1]
and the C reproducer that triggers it [2]).</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23143 | net: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.

When I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two
LOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]

Reproduction Steps:

  1) Mount CIFS
  2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS
  3) Unmount CIFS
  4) Unload the CIFS module
  5) Remove the iptables rule

At step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying
TCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in
FIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.

At this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still
alive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.

  # ss -tan
  State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port
  FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445

  # lsmod | grep cifs
  cifs                 1159168  0

This highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module
and the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release()
and it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to
close the connection gracefully.

While this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because
CIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk-&gt;sk_lock
using sock_lock_init_class_and_name().

Once an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires,
sk-&gt;sk_lock is acquired.

Then, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where
hlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since
the module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning
and returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.

If LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling
sock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded
while such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.

Let's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name()
and release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().

Note that sock_lock_init() clears sk-&gt;sk_owner for svc_create_socket()
that calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket,
which clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.

mptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow

When testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in
'mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow' because subflow_req-&gt;msk is NULL.

Call trace:

  mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:63 (discriminator 4)) (P)
  subflow_syn_recv_sock (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:854)

  ip_local_deliver (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:254)
  ip_rcv_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:449)
  ...

According to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very
short time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due
to multiple reasons.

Even if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they
can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The
'subflow_req-&gt;msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,
and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req-&gt;msk' under the
`own_req == true` conditional.

Note that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because
the same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the
code has been moved to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23146 | mfd: ene-kb3930: Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()

The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not
been probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`
to queue an IBI work task, leading to "Unable to handle kernel read from
unreadable memory" and resulting in a kernel panic.

Typical IBI handling flow:
1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.
2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI
   and assigns `dev-&gt;ibi = ibi`.
3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls
   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driver’s IBI
   handler task.

However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe
sequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev-&gt;ibi` to be `NULL`,
leading to a kernel panic.

Add a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing
an uninitialized `dev-&gt;ibi`, ensuring stability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23148 | soc: samsung: exynos-chipid: Add NULL pointer check in exynos_chipid_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

'i' in this case could go down to -1, in which case sum of active entries

split in half if sum would exceed at the very last block, which in case of
having too many long name files in a single block could lead to
out-of-bounds access and following use-after-free.

bus: mhi: host: Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf

A client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce
incoming data during the client driver's tear down. The client driver
might also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to
mhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs
after mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic
will occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault.

This occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state
after locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel
state is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data.

The access to the PCI config space via pci_ops::read and pci_ops::write is
a low-level hardware access. The functions can be accessed with disabled
interrupts even on PREEMPT_RT. The pci_lock is a raw_spinlock_t for this

drm/xe/vf: Don't try to trigger a full GT reset if VF

VFs don't have access to the GDRST(0x941c) register that driver
uses to reset a GT. Attempt to trigger a reset using debugfs:

 $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.1/gt0/force_reset

or due to a hang condition detected by the driver leads to:

Device setup:

     netdevsim0 (down)
     ^        ^
  bond        netdevsim1.100@netdevsim1 allmulticast=on (down)

When we enslave the lower device (netdevsim0) which has a vlan, we
propagate vlan's allmuti/promisc flags during ndo_open. This causes
(re)locking on of the real_dev.

Propagate allmulti/promisc on flags change, not on the open. There
is a slight semantics change that vlans that are down now propagate
the flags, but this seems unlikely to result in the real issues.

Reproducer:

  echo 0 1 &gt; /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device

  dev_path=$(ls -d /sys/bus/netdevsim/devices/netdevsim0/net/*)
  dev=$(echo $dev_path | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)

  ip link set dev $dev name netdevsim0
  ip link set dev netdevsim0 up

  ip link add link netdevsim0 name netdevsim0.100 type vlan id 100
  ip link set dev netdevsim0.100 allm

index 18446744073709550692 (decimal, unsigned long long)
= 0xfffffffffffffc64 (hexadecimal, unsigned long long)
= -924 (decimal, long long)

In f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), UBSAN detects that get_nid() tries to
access .i_nid[-924], it means both offset[0] and level should zero.

The possible case should be in f2fs_do_truncate_blocks(), we try to
truncate inode size to zero, however, dn.ofs_in_node is zero and
dn.node_page is not an inode page, so it fails to truncate inode page,
and then pass zeroed free_from to f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), result
in this issue.

	if (dn.ofs_in_node || IS_INODE(dn.node_page)) {
		f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range(&amp;amp;dn, count);
		free_from += count;
	}

I guess the reason why dn.node_page is not an inode page could be: there
are multiple nat entries share the same node block address, once the node
block address was reused, f2fs_get_node_page() may load a non-inode block.

Let's add a sanity check for such condition to avoid out-of-bounds access
issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37740 | jfs: add sanity check for agwidth in dbMount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37740</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: Prevent copying of nlink with value 0 from disk inode

syzbot report a deadlock in diFree. [1]

When calling "ioctl$LOOP_SET_STATUS64", the offset value passed in is 4,
which does not match the mounted loop device, causing the mapping of the
mounted loop device to be invalidated.

When creating the directory and creating the inode of iag in diReadSpecial(),
read the page of fixed disk inode (AIT) in raw mode in read_metapage(), the
metapage data it returns is corrupted, which causes the nlink value of 0 to be
assigned to the iag inode when executing copy_from_dinode(), which ultimately
causes a deadlock when entering diFree().

To avoid this, first check the nlink value of dinode before setting iag inode.

=====================================================

The reason is that imap is not properly initialized after memory
allocation. It will cause the snprintf() function to write uninitialized
data into linebuf within hex_dump_to_buffer().

Fix this by using kzalloc instead of kmalloc to clear its content at the
beginning in diMount().</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37743 | wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics

Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and
standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from
the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the
ppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor
mode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is
captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.

When the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is
activated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,
the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter
configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and
kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a
memory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while
enabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while
enabling extended statistics mode in the driver.

Fix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in
the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone
monitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.
These TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor
mode in the future.

PM: hibernate: Avoid deadlock in hibernate_compressor_param_set()

syzbot reported a deadlock in lock_system_sleep() (see below).

The write operation to "/sys/module/hibernate/parameters/compressor"
conflicts with the registration of ieee80211 device, resulting in a deadlock
when attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex under param_lock.

To avoid this deadlock, change hibernate_compressor_param_set() to use
mutex_trylock() for attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex and
return -EBUSY when it fails.

Task flags need not be saved or adjusted before calling
mutex_trylock(&amp;amp;system_transition_mutex) because the caller is not going
to end up waiting for this mutex and if it runs concurrently with system
suspend in progress, it will be frozen properly when it returns to user
space.

perf/dwc_pcie: fix duplicate pci_dev devices

During platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device
pci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse
still, accessing the duplicated device leads to list corruption as its
mutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same as the original.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37747 | perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event

Perf can hang while freeing a sigtrap event if a related deferred
signal hadn't managed to be sent before the file got closed:

perf_event_overflow()
   task_work_add(perf_pending_task)

fput()
   task_work_add(____fput())

task_work_run()
    ____fput()
        perf_release()
            perf_event_release_kernel()
                _free_event()
                    perf_pending_task_sync()
                        task_work_cancel() -&gt; FAILED
                        rcuwait_wait_event()

Once task_work_run() is running, the list of pending callbacks is
removed from the task_struct and from this point on task_work_cancel()
can't remove any pending and not yet started work items, hence the
task_work_cancel() failure and the hang on rcuwait_wait_event().

Task work could be changed to remove one work at a time, so a work
running on the current task can always cancel a pending one, however
the wait / wake design is still subject to inverted dependencies when
remote targets are involved, as pictured by Oleg:

T1                                                      T2

fd = perf_event_open(pid =&gt; T2-&gt;pid);                  fd = perf_event_open(pid =&gt; T1-&gt;pid);
close(fd)                                              close(fd)
                                                      
    perf_event_overflow()                                  perf_event_overflow()
       task_work_add(perf_pending_task)                        task_work_add(perf_pending_task)
                                                     
    fput()                                                 fput()
        task_work_add(____fput())                              task_work_add(____fput())

    task_work_run()                                        task_work_run()
        ____fput()                                             ____fput()
            perf_release()                                         perf_release()
                perf_event_release_kernel()                            perf_event_release_kernel()
                    _free_event()                                          _free_event()
                        perf_pending_task_sync()                               perf_pending_task_sync()
                            rcuwait_wait_event()                                   rcuwait_wait_event()

Therefore the only option left is to acquire the event reference count
upon queueing the perf task work and release it from the task work, just
like it was done before 3a5465418f5f ("perf: Fix event leak upon exec and file release")
but without the leaks it fixed.

Some adjustments are necessary to make it work:

* A child event might dereference its parent upon freeing. Care must be
  taken to release the parent last.

* Some places assuming the event doesn't have any reference held and
  therefore can be freed right away must instead put the reference and
  let the reference counting to its job.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37748 | iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37748</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hw_list is accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe).

So, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register is called

net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data on ppp_sync_txmung

Ensure we have enough data in linear buffer from skb before accessing
initial bytes. This prevents potential out-of-bounds accesses
when processing short packets.

When ppp_sync_txmung receives an incoming package with an empty
payload:
(remote) gef➤  p *(struct pppoe_hdr *) (skb-&gt;head + skb-&gt;network_header)
$18 = {
	type = 0x1,
	ver = 0x1,
	code = 0x0,
	sid = 0x2,
        length = 0x0,
	tag = 0xffff8880371cdb96
}

from the skb struct (trimmed)
      tail = 0x16,
      end = 0x140,
      head = 0xffff88803346f400 "4",
      data = 0xffff88803346f416 ":\377",

      len = 0x0,
      data_len = 0x0,
      mac_len = 0xe,
      hdr_len = 0x0,

it is not safe to access data[2].

smb: client: fix UAF in decryption with multichannel

After commit f7025d861694 ("smb: client: allocate crypto only for

async decryption"), the channels started reusing AEAD TFM from primary
channel to perform synchronous decryption, but that can't done as
there could be multiple cifsd threads (one per channel) simultaneously
accessing it to perform decryption.

It is not sufficient to directly validate the limit on the data that
the user passes as it can be updated based on how the other parameters
are changed.

Move the check at the end of the configuration update process to also
catch scenarios where the limit is indirectly updated, for example
with the following configurations:

tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1: root sfq limit 2 flows 1 depth 1
tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1: root sfq limit 2 flows 1 divisor 1

s390/cpumf: Fix double free on error in cpumf_pmu_event_init()

In PMU event initialization functions
 - cpumsf_pmu_event_init()
 - cpumf_pmu_event_init()
 - cfdiag_event_init()
the partially created event had to be removed when an error was detected.
The event::event_init() member function had to release all resources
it allocated in case of error. event::destroy() had to be called
on freeing an event after it was successfully created and
event::event_init() returned success.

With

commit c70ca298036c ("perf/core: Simplify the perf_event_alloc() error path")

this is not necessary anymore. The performance subsystem common
code now always calls event::destroy() to clean up the allocated
resources created during event initialization.

Remove the event::destroy() invocation in PMU event initialization
or that function is called twice for each event that runs into an
error condition in event creation.

This is the kernel log entry which shows up without the fix:

net: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect

syzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and then
run into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vague
recollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.
Supporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offload
is enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.
Disconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.

The immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,
but that's just the easiest bug to trigger:

Add NULL check after devm_ioremap() to prevent this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:14:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37759 | ublk: fix handling recovery &amp;amp; reissue in ublk_abort_queue()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix handling recovery &amp; reissue in ublk_abort_queue()

Commit 8284066946e6 ("ublk: grab request reference when the request is handled
by userspace") doesn't grab request reference in case of recovery reissue.
Then the request can be requeued &amp; re-dispatch &amp; failed when canceling
uring command.

If it is one zc request, the request can be freed before io_uring
returns the zc buffer back, then cause kernel panic:

However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.


Fixed in:

 

 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 


Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 01:02:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4143 | Missing validation of redirect_uri on authorize endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4143</link><description>The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 01:02:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4145 | Netgear EX6200 sub_3D0BC buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4145</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Netgear EX6200 1.0.3.94.

So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).

Prior to version 3.3.3, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint `PATCH /api/users/:id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27409 | Joplin Server Vulnerable to Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27409</link><description>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static file path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path, the result is returned directly, without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32376 | Discourse DM limits aren’t always properly enforced</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32376</link><description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights, it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context, this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13, 16.4.4, and 16.8.0-rc-1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32972 | The lesscss script service allows cache clearing without programming right</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32972</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts, the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32973 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-component-wiki provides no warning when granting XWiki.ComponentClass programming right</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32973</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, when a user with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass, there is no warning that this will grant programming rights to this object. An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32974 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default required rights analysis doesn&amp;#x27;t consider TextAreas with default content type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32974</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46342 | Kyverno vulnerable to bypass of policy rules that use namespace selectors in match statements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46342</link><description>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4122 | Netgear JWNR2000v2 sub_435E04 command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4122</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Netgear JWNR2000v2 1.0.0.11.

In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 01:47:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32444 | vLLM Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Mooncake Integration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32444</link><description>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable.

vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame

Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service
load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.

If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as
IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case
of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped
on the path.

vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()
through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:

  page = virt_to_page(xdpf-&gt;data);
  tbi-&gt;dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +
                  VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;
  dma_sync_single_for_device(&amp;amp;adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;dev,
                             tbi-&gt;dma_addr, buf_size,
                             DMA_TO_DEVICE);

The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP
BPF program could have moved xdp-&gt;data. While the passed buf_size is
correct (xdpf-&gt;len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which
can be calculated as xdpf-&gt;data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp-&gt;data -
xdp-&gt;data_hard_start.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1194 | Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in huggingface/transformers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1194</link><description>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified in the huggingface/transformers library, specifically in the file `tokenization_gpt_neox_japanese.py` of the GPT-NeoX-Japanese model.

The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.

A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.

We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:38:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3452 | SecuPress Free &amp;lt;= 2.3.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Installation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3452</link><description>The SecuPress Free — WordPress Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'secupress_reinstall_plugins_admin_ajax_cb' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9.

Prior to version 1.90.0, n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, which are accessible to authenticated users. However, there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files, and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:46:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24179 | A null pointer dereference was addressed with improved input validation.
