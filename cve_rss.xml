The issue impacts only Kibana version 8.10.0 when logging in the JSON layout or when the pattern layout is configured to log the %meta pattern. Elastic has released Kibana 8.10.1 which resolves this issue. The error object recorded in the log contains request information, which can include sensitive data, such as authentication credentials, cookies, authorization headers, query params, request paths, and other metadata. Some examples of sensitive data which can be included in the logs are account credentials for kibana_system, kibana-metricbeat, or Kibana end-users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 01:59:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46667 | Fleet Server Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46667</link><description>An issue was discovered in Fleet Server &gt;= v8.10.0 and &lt; v8.10.3 where Agent enrolment tokens are being inserted into the Fleet Server’s log file in plain text.

vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46232</link><description>era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era, a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10, a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word’s index unset, that is effectively set to 0, so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away, but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space, e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:18:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46137 | twisted.web has disordered HTTP pipeline response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46137</link><description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior to version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP packet, twisted.web will process the requests asynchronously without guaranteeing the response order. If one of the endpoints is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can delay the response on purpose to manipulate the response of the second request when a victim launched two requests using HTTP pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:18:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46133 | crypto-es PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times weaker than current standard</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46133</link><description>CryptoES is a cryptography algorithms library compatible with ES6 and TypeScript. Prior to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:18:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46134 | D-Tale vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through the Custom Filter Input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46134</link><description>D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end to view &amp; analyze Pandas data structures.

When trying to create a document that already exists, XWiki displays an error message in the form for creating it. Due to missing escaping, this error message is vulnerable to raw HTML injection and thus XSS. The injected code is the document reference of the existing document so this requires that the attacker first creates a non-empty document whose name contains the attack code. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 13.4-rc-1 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding the appropriate escaping.

When document names are validated according to a name strategy (disabled by default), XWiki starting in version 12.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 12.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting attack in the page creation form. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary actions with the rights of the user opening the malicious link. Depending on the rights of the user, this may allow remote code execution and full read and write access to the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file `createinline.vm` is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from the fix.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:41:45

create page action doesn&amp;#x27;t display the page&amp;#x27;s title</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45135</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` versions 7.2-milestone-2 until 14.10.12 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, it is possible to pass a title to the page creation action that isn't displayed at first but then executed in the second step. This can be used by an attacker to trick a victim to execute code, allowing script execution if the victim has script right or remote code execution including full access to the XWiki instance if the victim has programming right.

For the attack to work, the attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a link like `&lt;xwiki-host&gt;/xwiki/bin/create/NonExistingSpace/WebHome?title=$services.logging.getLogger(%22foo%22).error(%22Script%20executed!%22)` where `&lt;xwiki-host&gt;`  is the URL of the Wiki installation and to then click on the "Create" button on that page. The page looks like a regular XWiki page that the victim would also see when clicking the button to create a page that doesn't exist yet, the malicious code is not displayed anywhere on that page. After clicking the "Create" button, the malicious title would be displayed but at this point, the code has already been executed and the attacker could use this code also to hide the attack, e.g., by redirecting the victim again to the same page with an innocent title. It thus seems plausible that this attack could work if the attacker can place a fake "create page" button on a page which is possible with edit right.

This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 14.10.12 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by displaying the title already in the first step such that the victim can notice the attack before continuing. It is possible to manually patch the modified files from the patch in an existing installation. For the JavaScript change, the minified JavaScript file would need to be obtained from a build of XWiki and replaced accordingly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:35:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-4886 | Ingress-nginx `path` sanitization can be bypassed with `log_format` directive</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4886</link><description>Ingress-nginx `path` sanitization can be bypassed with `log_format` directive.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:35:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5043 | Ingress nginx annotation injection causes arbitrary command execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5043</link><description>Ingress nginx annotation injection causes arbitrary command execution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:35:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5044 | Code injection via nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5044</link><description>Code injection via nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:35:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45134 | XWiki Platform XSS vulnerability from account in the create page form via template provider</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45134</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-1 and prior to 13.4-rc-1, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions 14.10.2 and 15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-standard` starting in version 2.4-milestone-2 and prior to version 3.1-milestone-1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An attacker can create a template provider on any document that is part of the wiki (could be the attacker's user profile) that contains malicious code. This code is executed when this template provider is selected during document creation which can be triggered by sending the user to a URL. For the attacker, the only requirement is to have an account as by default the own user profile is editable. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary actions with the rights of the user opening the malicious link. Depending on the rights of the user, this may allow remote code execution and full read and write access to the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` 13.4-rc-1, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` 14.10.2 and 15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-standard` 3.1-milestone-1 by adding the appropriate escaping.

Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1, triggering the office converter with a specially crafted file name allows writing the attachment's content to an attacker-controlled location on the server as long as the Java process has write access to that location. In particular in the combination with attachment moving, a feature introduced in XWiki 14.0, this is easy to reproduce but it also possible to reproduce in versions as old as XWiki 3.5 by uploading the attachment through the REST API which doesn't remove `/` or `\` from the filename. As the mime type of the attachment doesn't matter for the exploitation, this could e.g., be used to replace the `jar`-file of an extension which would allow executing arbitrary Java code and thus impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3RC1. There are no known workarounds apart from disabling the office converter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:27:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37912 | XWiki Rendering&amp;#x27;s footnote macro vulnerable to privilege escalation via the footnote macro</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37912</link><description>XWiki Rendering is a generic Rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax into another syntax. Prior to version 14.10.6 of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-core-rendering-macro-footnotes` and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes` and prior to version 15.1-rc-1 of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes`, the footnote macro executed its content in a potentially different context than the one in which it was defined. In particular in combination with the include macro, this allows privilege escalation from a simple user account in XWiki to programming rights and thus remote code execution, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1-rc-1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version of the footnote macro.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:39:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37910 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-api vulnerable to Missing Authorization on Attachment Move</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37910</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Starting with the introduction of attachment move support in version 14.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, an attacker with edit access on any document (can be the user profile which is editable by default) can move any attachment of any other document to this attacker-controlled document. This allows the attacker to access and possibly publish any attachment of which the name is known, regardless if the attacker has view or edit rights on the source document of this attachment. Further, the attachment is deleted from the source document. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0 RC1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:26:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37911 | org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore may leak data through deleted and re-created documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37911</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 9.4-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1, when a document has been deleted and re-created, it is possible for users with view right on the re-created document but not on the deleted document to view the contents of the deleted document. Such a situation might arise when rights were added to the deleted document. This can be exploited through the diff feature and, partially, through the REST API by using versions such as `deleted:1` (where the number counts the deletions in the wiki and is thus guessable). Given sufficient rights, the attacker can also re-create the deleted document, thus extending the scope to any deleted document as long as the attacker has edit right in the location of the deleted document. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3 RC1 by properly checking rights when deleted revisions of a document are accessed. The only workaround is to regularly clean deleted documents to minimize the potential exposure. Extra care should be taken when deleting sensitive documents that are protected individually (and not, e.g., by being placed in a protected space) or deleting a protected space as a whole.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:26:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37909 | Privilege escalation (PR)/remote code execution from account through Menu.UIExtensionSheet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37909</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 5.1-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1, any user who can edit their own user profile can execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1 by adding proper escaping. As a workaround, the patch can be manually applied to the document `Menu.UIExtensionSheet`; only three lines need to be changed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:26:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5671 | HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows may potentially be vulnerable to escalation of privilege.

The cleaning of attributes during XHTML rendering, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid attribute names. This can be exploited, e.g., via the link syntax in any content that supports XWiki syntax like comments in XWiki. When a user moves the mouse over a malicious link, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. When this user is a privileged user who has programming rights, this allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. While this attribute was correctly recognized as not allowed, the attribute was still printed with a prefix `data-xwiki-translated-attribute-` without further cleaning or validation. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by removing characters not allowed in data attributes and then validating the cleaned attribute again. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 16:57:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5472 | Use after free in Profiles in Google Chrome prior to 118.0.5993.117 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5472</link><description>Use after free in Profiles in Google Chrome prior to 118.0.5993.117 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:51:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31582 | jose4j before v0.9.3 allows attackers to set a low iteration count of 1000 or less.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31582</link><description>jose4j before v0.9.3 allows attackers to set a low iteration count of 1000 or less.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:51:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31581 | Dromara Sureness before v1.0.8 was discovered to use a hardcoded key.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31581</link><description>Dromara Sureness before v1.0.8 was discovered to use a hardcoded key.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-43795 | WPS Server Side Request Forgery in GeoServer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43795</link><description>GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.

initialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,
via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,
within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:39:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20273 | A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands with the pri...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20273</link><description>A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands with the privileges of root.&#13;
