For importing tables, TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:38:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23838 | TrueLayer.Client SSRF when fetching payment or payment provider</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23838</link><description>TrueLayer.NET is the .Net client for TrueLayer.  The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious actor to gain control over the destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes. For applications using the SDK, requests to unexpected resources on local networks or to the internet could be made which could lead to information disclosure. The issue can be mitigated by having strict egress rules limiting the destinations to which requests can be made, and applying strict validation to any user input passed to the `truelayer-dotnet` library. Versions of TrueLayer.Client `v1.6.0` and later are not affected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:38:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23647 | PKCE downgrade attack in Authentik</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23647</link><description>Authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. There is a bug in our implementation of PKCE that allows an attacker to circumvent the protection that PKCE offers. PKCE adds the code_challenge parameter to the authorization request and adds the code_verifier parameter to the token request. Prior to 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7, a downgrade scenario is possible: if the attacker removes the code_challenge parameter from the authorization request, authentik will not do the PKCE check. Because of this bug, an attacker can circumvent the protection PKCE offers, such as CSRF attacks and code injection attacks.  Versions 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:28:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1019 | WAF bypass of the ModSecurity v3 release line</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1019</link><description>ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs. ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs to construct queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. The ModSecurity v2 release line is not affected by this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:12:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1035 | openBI Icon.php uploadIcon unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1035</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in openBI up to 1.0.8 and classified as critical.

There are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be stored unencrypted in a database.  Users should ensure they set the encryption setting correctly.  This vulnerability is patched in 4.2.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21653 | vantage6 insecure SSH configuration for node and server containers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21653</link><description>The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).  Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.  The vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the docker file and rebuilding the docker image.  Version 4.2.0 patches the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:49:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21671 | vantage6 username timing attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21671</link><description>The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).

The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:21:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24324 | TOTOLINK A8000RU

When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged mitigations.  Version 3.9.2 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 22:45:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23829 |  aiohttp&amp;#x27;s HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about separators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23829</link><description>aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627.

When the kylin service runs over HTTP (or other plain text protocol), it is possible for network sniffers to hijack the HTTP payload and get access to the content of kylin.properties and potentially the containing credentials.

To avoid this threat, users are recommended to 

  *  Always turn on HTTPS so that network payload is encrypted.

  *  Avoid putting credentials in kylin.properties, or at least not in plain text.
  *  Use network firewalls to protect the serverside such that it is not accessible to external attackers.

  *  Upgrade to version Apache Kylin 4.0.4, which filters out the sensitive content that goes to the Server Config web interface.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 12:25:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5378 | Stored XSS in SmodBIP and MegaBIP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5378</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in  MegaBIP and already unsupported SmodBIP software allows for Stored XSS.This issue affects SmodBIP in all versions and MegaBIP in versions up to 4.36.2 (newer versions were not tested; the vendor has not confirmed fixing the vulnerability).</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 11:17:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46838 | Linux: netback processing of zero-length transmit fragment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46838</link><description>Transmit requests in Xen's virtual network protocol can consist of
