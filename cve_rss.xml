This vulnerability can allow a Remote Code Execution (RCE) primitive by supplying an arbitrary command to execute in the --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments. A low-privilege user, for example, a user with developer access, can create a specially crafted FenceAgentsRemediation for a fence agent supporting  --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments to execute arbitrary commands on the operator's pod. This RCE leads to a privilege escalation, first as the service account running the operator, then to another service account with cluster-admin privileges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 05:51:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5527 | SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5527</link><description>Zohocorp ManageEngine ADAudit Plus versions below 8110 are vulnerable to authenticated SQL Injection in file auditing configuration.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 05:41:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7694 | TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware - Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7694</link><description>ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware from TeamT5 does not properly validate the content of uploaded files.

The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.

This issue is another instance of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in this case is from the integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD.

As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code execution as root.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 03:20:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7660 | SourceCodester File Manager App Add File cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7660</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester File Manager App 1.0 and classified as problematic.

When pf is configured to allow ND and block incoming Echo Requests, a crafted Echo Request packet after a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) can trigger an Echo Reply.  The packet has to come from the same host as the NS and have a zero as identifier to match the state created by the Neighbor Discovery and allow replies to be generated.

ICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall rules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going to create a state in the state table.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6759 | NFS client accepts file names containing path separators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6759</link><description>When mounting a remote filesystem using NFS, the kernel did not sanitize remotely provided filenames for the path separator character, "/".  This allows readdir(3) and related functions to return filesystem entries with names containing additional path components.

The lack of validation described above gives rise to a confused deputy problem.  For example, a program copying files from an NFS mount could be tricked into copying from outside the intended source directory, and/or to a location outside the intended destination directory.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6760 | ktrace(2) fails to detach when executing a setuid binary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6760</link><description>A logic bug in the code which disables kernel tracing for setuid programs meant that tracing was not disabled when it should have, allowing unprivileged users to trace and inspect the behavior of setuid programs.
