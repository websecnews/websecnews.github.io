Versions below 0.0.2 contain a command injection vulnerability, caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, &gt;, &amp;&amp;, etc.). This issue is fixed in version 0.0.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 01:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9941 | CodeAstro Real Estate Management System register.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9941</link><description>A flaw has been found in CodeAstro Real Estate Management System 1.0.

In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks. This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final and 4.2.5.Final.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 21:09:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9927 | projectworlds Travel Management System viewpackage.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9927</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in projectworlds Travel Management System 1.0.

In versions below 1.32.10 and 1.33.0 through 1.33.6, 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0, insufficient Session Expiration in the Envoy OAuth2 filter leads to failed logout operations. When configured with __Secure- or __Host- prefixed cookie names, the filter fails to append the required Secure attribute to the Set-Cookie header during deletion. Modern browsers ignore this invalid request, causing the session cookie to persist. This allows a user to remain logged in after they believe they have logged out, creating a session hijacking risk on shared computers. The current implementation iterates through the configured cookie names to generate deletion headers but does not check for these prefixes. This failure to properly construct the deletion header means the user's session cookies are never removed by the browser, leaving the session active and allowing the next user of the same browser to gain unauthorized access to the original user's account and data. This is fixed in versions 1.32.10, 1.33.7, 1.34.5 and 1.35.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 19:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9365 | Fuji Electric FRENIC-Loader 4 Deserialization of Untrusted Data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9365</link><description>Fuji Electric FRENIC-Loader 4 is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data when importing a file through a specified window, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 19:39:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9925 | projectworlds Travel Management System detail.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9925</link><description>A vulnerability was found in projectworlds Travel Management System 1.0.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:44:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20328 | A vulnerability in the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileg...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20328</link><description>A vulnerability in the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.
&#13; This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to conduct an XSS attack against the targeted user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:44:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20330 | Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20330</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;amp;P) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:44:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20335 | Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Video Phone 8875 with SIP Firmware Information Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20335</link><description>A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to write arbitrary files on an affected device.

When a client initiates an HTTPS connection, the server performs the SSL handshake before assigning the connection to a processing slot. However, there is no specific timeout set for this phase, and the server uses the default socket timeout, which is effectively infinite. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malformed TLS ClientHello message with incorrect length values. This causes the server to wait indefinitely for data that never arrives, blocking the worker thread (Line) handling the connection. By opening multiple such connections, up to the server's maximum limit, the attacker can exhaust all available working threads, preventing the server from handling new, legitimate requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56752 | A vulnerability in the Ruijie RG-ES series switch firmware ESW_1.0(1)B1P39 enables remote attackers to fully bypass authentication mechanism...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56752</link><description>A vulnerability in the Ruijie RG-ES series switch firmware ESW_1.0(1)B1P39 enables remote attackers to fully bypass authentication mechanisms, providing them with unrestricted access to alter administrative settings and potentially seize control of affected devices via crafted HTTP POST request to /user.cgi.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56803 | Figma Desktop for Windows version 125.6.5 contains a command injection vulnerability in the local plugin loader.

This occurs because user-supplied input is reflected back in the server’s response without proper sanitization or escaping, potentially enabling malicious actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions in the application.

DetailsThe vulnerability resides in the “Tags” input field on the /s/ajax?action=lead:addLeadTags endpoint. Although the server applies sanitization before storing the data or returning it later, the payload is executed immediately in the victim’s browser upon reflection, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s session.

ImpactA Reflected XSS attack can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data like cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, manipulate the web page content, and essentially take control of a user's session within an application by executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, even if the server-side code is secure; essentially enabling them to perform actions as if they were the logged-in user.

This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.

PatchesThis vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.

Technical DetailsThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:

  *  A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)
  *  An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)


The fix introduces a TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.

WorkaroundsNo workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.

netfilter: nf_tables: reject duplicate device on updates

A chain/flowtable update with duplicated devices in the same batch is
possible. Unfortunately, netdev event path only removes the first
device that is found, leaving unregistered the hook of the duplicated
device.

Check if a duplicated device exists in the transaction batch, bail out
with EEXIST in such case.

WARNING is hit when unregistering the hook:

This header ensures that responses vary appropriately based on request headers such as language or authentication. Without this check, cached content can be incorrectly reused across different requests, potentially exposing sensitive user information.

The framework automatically reads the entire request body on every HTTP request, regardless of whether the application needs it. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with large payloads, causing excessive memory consumption and potentially exhausting available server memory, leading to application crashes or service unavailability. The vulnerability was fixed in v1.2 by implementing lazy loading of request bodies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:42:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13063 | IDOR in Akinsoft&amp;#x27;s MyRezzta</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13063</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Akinsoft MyRezzta allows Forceful Browsing.This issue affects MyRezzta: from s2.02.02 before v2.05.01.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:42:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9219 | Post SMTP &amp;lt;= 3.4.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited Plugin Option Update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9219</link><description>The Post SMTP – WP SMTP Plugin with Email Logs and Mobile App for Failure Notifications – Gmail SMTP, Office 365, Brevo, Mailgun, Amazon SES and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'update_post_smtp_pro_option_callback' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.1.

certificates for Print Deploy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9785</link><description>PaperCut Print Deploy is an optional component that integrates with PaperCut NG/MF which simplifies printer deployment and management. When the component is deployed to an environment, the customer has an option to configure the system to use a self-signed certificate. If the customer does not fully configure the system to leverage the trust database on the clients, it opens up the communication between clients and the server to man-in-the-middle attacks. 

It was discovered that certain parts of the documentation related to the configuration of SSL in Print Deploy were lacking, which could potentially contribute to a misconfiguration of the Print Deploy client installation. PaperCut strongly recommends to use valid certificates to secure installations and to follow the updated documentation to ensure the correct SSL configuration. Those who use private CAs and/or self-signed certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority certificate, or their self signed certificate if using only one, to the trust store of their operating system and to the Java key store</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:39:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58176 | Dive&amp;#x27;s improper processing of custom urls can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58176</link><description>Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58351 | Outline&amp;#x27;s Local File Storage Feature can Cause CSP Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58351</link><description>Outline is a service that allows for collaborative documentation. In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 03:35:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7039 | Glib: buffer under-read on glib through glib/gfileutils.c via get_tmp_file()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7039</link><description>A flaw was found in glib. An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58163 | FreeScout&amp;#x27;s deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58163</link><description>FreeScout is a free help desk and shared inbox built with PHP's Laravel framework. In versions 1.8.185 and below, the application performs deserialization of data that can allow authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited via endpoint: `/help/{mailbox_id}/auth/{customer_id}/{hash}/{timestamp}` where the `customer_id` and `timestamp` parameters are processed through the decrypt function in `app/Helper.php` without proper validation. The vulnerable code performs decryption using Laravel's built-in encryption functions, which subsequently deserializes the decrypted payload without sanitization. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 02:23:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9847 | ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System register.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9847</link><description>A weakness has been identified in ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System 1.0.

Versions 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0 contain a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache, causing abnormal process termination. The vulnerability is in Envoy's Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation, occurring when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions. This condition may occur when the following conditions are met: dynamic Forwarding Filter is enabled, the `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag is enabled, and the Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding Filter and Router filters. This issue is resolved in versions 1.34.5 and 1.35.1.
