The TrustyAI component is granting all service accounts and users on a cluster permissions to  get, list, watch any pod in any namespace on the cluster.

TrustyAI is creating a role `trustyai-service-operator-lmeval-user-role` and a CRB `trustyai-service-operator-default-lmeval-user-rolebinding` which is being applied to `system:authenticated` making it so that every single user or service account can get a list of pods running in any namespace on the cluster

pinmux_ops - pinmux_generic_get_function_name() - can fail and return
NULL. This is already checked in pinmux_check_ops() so add a similar
check in pinmux_func_name_to_selector() instead of passing the returned

PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Add NULL check for DMA channels before release

The fields dma_chan_tx and dma_chan_rx of the struct pci_epf_test can be
NULL even after EPF initialization. Then it is prudent to check that
they have non-NULL values before releasing the channels. Add the checks
in pci_epf_test_clean_dma_chan().

Without the checks, NULL pointer dereferences happen and they can lead
to a kernel panic in some cases:

PCI/AER: Avoid NULL pointer dereference in aer_ratelimit()

When platform firmware supplies error information to the OS, e.g., via the
ACPI APEI GHES mechanism, it may identify an error source device that
doesn't advertise an AER Capability and therefore dev-&gt;aer_info, which
contains AER stats and ratelimiting data, is NULL.

pci_dev_aer_stats_incr() already checks dev-&gt;aer_info for NULL, but
aer_ratelimit() did not, leading to NULL pointer dereferences like this one
from the URL below:

  {1}[Hardware Error]: Hardware error from APEI Generic Hardware Error Source: 0
  {1}[Hardware Error]: event severity: corrected
  {1}[Hardware Error]:   device_id: 0000:00:00.0

  {1}[Hardware Error]:   aer_cor_status: 0x00001000, aer_cor_mask: 0x00002000
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000264
  RIP: 0010:___ratelimit+0xc/0x1b0
  pci_print_aer+0x141/0x360
  aer_recover_work_func+0xb5/0x130

[8086:2020] is an Intel "Sky Lake-E DMI3 Registers" device that claims to
be a Root Port but does not advertise an AER Capability.

Add a NULL check in aer_ratelimit() to avoid the NULL pointer dereference.
Note that this also prevents ratelimiting these events from GHES.

fbdev: simplefb: Fix use after free in simplefb_detach_genpds()

The pm_domain cleanup can not be devres managed as it uses struct
simplefb_par which is allocated within struct fb_info by
framebuffer_alloc(). This allocation is explicitly freed by
unregister_framebuffer() in simplefb_remove().
Devres managed cleanup runs after the device remove call and thus can no
longer access struct simplefb_par.
Call simplefb_detach_genpds() explicitly from simplefb_destroy() like
the cleanup functions for clocks and regulators.

Fixes an use after free on M2 Mac mini during
aperture_remove_conflicting_devices() using the downstream asahi kernel
with Debian's kernel config. For unknown reasons this started to
consistently dereference an invalid pointer in v6.16.3 based kernels.

KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid

Skip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP
isn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must
decode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the
next RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading
guest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.
can sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs
disabled.

ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access

The 'sess-&gt;rpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd
session. Access to this list is intended to be protected by
'sess-&gt;rpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was
flawed, leading to potential race conditions.

In ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock
before calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify
the XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access
and prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.

Furthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()
without holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent
data or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and
the pointer is dereferenced.

Fix these issues by:
1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()
   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring
   the lock is correctly released on error paths.
2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()
   to safely protect the lookup.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40040 | mm/ksm: fix flag-dropping behavior in ksm_madvise</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40040</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Kernel panics because it detects UFFD inconsistency during
userfaultfd_release_all().  Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer
to vma-&gt;vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma-&gt;vm_flags.

The inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()
with MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,
it accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of
vma-&gt;vm_flags.

Assuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and
int are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &amp;=
~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.

VM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. 
After ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then
promoted to unsigned long before the &amp; operation.  This promotion fills
upper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and
even for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).
&amp; operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff
instead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears
the upper 32-bits of its value.

Fix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the
BIT() macro.

Note: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the
VM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int
and after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted
to unsigned long with leading 1s.

Note 2:
After commit 31defc3b01d9 ("userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s"), this is
no longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:

[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067

but the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.

The bpf_fifo_dequeue prog returns a skb which is a pointer. The pointer
is treated as a 32bit value and sign extend to 64bit in epilogue. This
behavior is right for most bpf prog types but wrong for struct ops which
requires LoongArch ABI.

So let's sign extend struct ops return values according to the LoongArch
ABI ([1]) and return value spec in function model.

Race Condition Analysis:

The race occurs between kprobe activation and perf_events initialization:

  CPU0                                    CPU1
  ====                                    ====
  perf_kprobe_init
    perf_trace_event_init
      tp_event-&gt;perf_events = list;(1)
      tp_event-&gt;class-&gt;reg (2)← KPROBE ACTIVE
                                          Debug exception triggers
                                          ...
                                          kprobe_dispatcher
                                            kprobe_perf_func (tk-&gt;tp.flags &amp; TP_FLAG_PROFILE)
                                              head = this_cpu_ptr(call-&gt;perf_events)(3)
                                              (perf_events is still NULL)

Problem:
1. CPU0 executes (1) assigning tp_event-&gt;perf_events = list
2. CPU0 executes (2) enabling kprobe functionality via class-&gt;reg()
3. CPU1 triggers and reaches kprobe_dispatcher
4. CPU1 checks TP_FLAG_PROFILE - condition passes (step 2 completed)
5. CPU1 calls kprobe_perf_func() and crashes at (3) because
   call-&gt;perf_events is still NULL

CPU1 sees that kprobe functionality is enabled but does not see that
perf_events has been assigned.

net: nfc: nci: Add parameter validation for packet data

Syzbot reported an uninitialized value bug in nci_init_req, which was
introduced by commit 5aca7966d2a7 ("Merge tag
'perf-tools-fixes-for-v6.17-2025-09-16' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools").

This bug arises due to very limited and poor input validation
that was done at nic_valid_size(). This validation only
validates the skb-&gt;len (directly reflects size provided at the
userspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer
itself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing
of memory content at the address assuming the correct layout
per what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to
buffer of `skb_buff-&gt;data` which is not assigned anything yet.

Following the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at
`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective
handlers and return error values in case of failure. Release
the skb if error values are returned from handlers in
`nci_nft_packet` and effectively do a silent drop

Possible TODO: because we silently drop the packets, the
call to `nci_request` will be waiting for completion of request
and will face timeouts. These timeouts can get excessively logged
in the dmesg. A proper handling of them may require to export
`nci_request_cancel` (or propagate error handling from the
nft packets handlers).</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40044 | fs: udf: fix OOB read in lengthAllocDescs handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40044</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: udf: fix OOB read in lengthAllocDescs handling

When parsing Allocation Extent Descriptor, lengthAllocDescs comes from
on-disk data and must be validated against the block size. Crafted or
corrupted images may set lengthAllocDescs so that the total descriptor
length (sizeof(allocExtDesc) + lengthAllocDescs) exceeds the buffer,
leading udf_update_tag() to call crc_itu_t() on out-of-bounds memory and
trigger a KASAN use-after-free read.

uio_hv_generic: Let userspace take care of interrupt mask

Remove the logic to set interrupt mask by default in uio_hv_generic
driver as the interrupt mask value is supposed to be controlled
completely by the user space. If the mask bit gets changed
by the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,
the mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the
user-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.

For eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,
the host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.
However, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a
message in the inbound ring buffer. So let’s assume that happens,
the host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.

Subsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring
buffer interrupt mask to 0, saying “Hey, I’m ready for interrupts”.
User space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.
Then one of two things happens:

* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.
* The host does send another message. But because there’s already a
  message in the ring buffer, it doesn’t generate an interrupt.
  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an
  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to
  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not
  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.
  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from
  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.

This could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay
setting interrupt mask to 0.

Similarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,
there’s a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring
buffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could
put another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn’t interrupt.
Then the next pread() would hang.

Fix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,
while keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace
control the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40049 | Squashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent

Syzkaller reports a "KMSAN: uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent" bug.

This is caused by open_by_handle_at() being called with a file handle
containing an invalid parent inode number.  In particular the inode number
is that of a symbolic link, rather than a directory.

Squashfs_get_parent() gets called with that symbolic link inode, and
accesses the parent member field.

	unsigned int parent_ino = squashfs_i(inode)-&gt;parent;

Because non-directory inodes in Squashfs do not have a parent value, this
is uninitialised, and this causes an uninitialised value access.

The fix is to initialise parent with the invalid inode 0, which will cause
an EINVAL error to be returned.

Regular inodes used to share the parent field with the block_list_start
field.  This is removed in this commit to enable the parent field to
contain the invalid inode number 0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40050 | bpf: Skip scalar adjustment for BPF_NEG if dst is a pointer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40050</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix crypto buffers in non-linear memory

The crypto API, through the scatterlist API, expects input buffers to be
in linear memory.  We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper
that converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.

However, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in
smb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly
puts aead_request-&gt;__ctx in vmalloc area.

AEAD algorithm then uses -&gt;__ctx for its private/internal data and
operations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.

This works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small
requests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.

Tasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too
many tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where
virt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that
happens.

In practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount
will trigger this bug.

To fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead.
Also drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since
kfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.

iommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk

Dirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit
in the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-
structure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In
another word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking
doesn't work.

The Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 "Snoop Behavior" states:

"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits
 in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-
 recoverable fault."

To prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page
tracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as
supported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40059 | coresight: Fix incorrect handling for return value of devm_kzalloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40059</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix race in do_task() when draining

When do_task() exhausts its iteration budget (!ret), it sets the state
to TASK_STATE_IDLE to reschedule, without a secondary check on the
current task-&gt;state. This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state
set by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().

While state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()
and rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to
finish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if
do_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.
The cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly
reschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.

This bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,
where the special handling for the draining case was lost.

Fix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is
TASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to
force a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so
that a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly
transition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40062 | crypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm-&amp;gt;debug.qm_diff_regs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40062</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops

In commit 42d9f6c77479 ("crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation
code into acomp"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on
having the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order
as the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and
free_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout
randomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure
(containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg
are randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then
the order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the

smc: Fix use-after-free in __pnet_find_base_ndev().

syzbot reported use-after-free of net_device in __pnet_find_base_ndev(),
which was called during connect(). [0]

smc_pnet_find_ism_resource() fetches sk_dst_get(sk)-&gt;dev and passes
down to pnet_find_base_ndev(), where RTNL is held.  Then, UAF happened
at __pnet_find_base_ndev() when the dev is first used.

This means dev had already been freed before acquiring RTNL in
pnet_find_base_ndev().

While dev is going away, dst-&gt;dev could be swapped with blackhole_netdev,
and the dev's refcnt by dst will be released.

We must hold dev's refcnt before calling smc_pnet_find_ism_resource().

Also, smc_pnet_find_roce_resource() has the same problem.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in the two functions.

fs/ntfs3: reject index allocation if $BITMAP is empty but blocks exist

Index allocation requires at least one bit in the $BITMAP attribute to
track usage of index entries. If the bitmap is empty while index blocks
are already present, this reflects on-disk corruption.

syzbot triggered this condition using a malformed NTFS image. During a
rename() operation involving a long filename (which spans multiple
index entries), the empty bitmap allowed the name to be added without
valid tracking. Subsequent deletion of the original entry failed with
-ENOENT, due to unexpected index state.

Reject such cases by verifying that the bitmap is not empty when index
blocks exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40068 | fs: ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in run_unpack()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40068</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in run_unpack()

The MFT record relative to the file being opened contains its runlist,
an array containing information about the file's location on the physical
disk. Analysis of all Call Stack paths showed that the values of the
runlist array, from which LCNs are calculated, are not validated before
run_unpack function.

The run_unpack function decodes the compressed runlist data format
from MFT attributes (for example, $DATA), converting them into a runs_tree
structure, which describes the mapping of virtual clusters (VCN) to
logical clusters (LCN). The NTFS3 subsystem also has a shortcut for
deleting files from MFT records - in this case, the RUN_DEALLOCATE
command is sent to the run_unpack input, and the function logic
provides that all data transferred to the runlist about file or
directory is deleted without creating a runs_tree structure.

Substituting the runlist in the $DATA attribute of the MFT record for an
arbitrary file can lead either to access to arbitrary data on the disk
bypassing access checks to them (since the inode access check
occurs above) or to destruction of arbitrary data on the disk.

Add overflow check for addition operation.

pps_register_cdev() call device_create() to create pps-&gt;dev, which will

tty: n_gsm: Don't block input queue by waiting MSC

Currently gsm_queue() processes incoming frames and when opening
a DLC channel it calls gsm_dlci_open() which calls gsm_modem_update().
If basic mode is used it calls gsm_modem_upd_via_msc() and it
cannot block the input queue by waiting the response to come
into the same input queue.

Instead allow sending Modem Status Command without waiting for remote
end to respond. Define a new function gsm_modem_send_initial_msc()
for this purpose. As MSC is only valid for basic encoding, it does
not do anything for advanced or when convergence layer type 2 is used.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40072 | fanotify: Validate the return value of mnt_ns_from_dentry() before dereferencing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fanotify: Validate the return value of mnt_ns_from_dentry() before dereferencing

The function do_fanotify_mark() does not validate if
mnt_ns_from_dentry() returns NULL before dereferencing mntns-&gt;user_ns.
This causes a NULL pointer dereference in do_fanotify_mark() if the
path is not a mount namespace object.

Fix this by checking mnt_ns_from_dentry()'s return value before
dereferencing it.

PCI: rcar-host: Pass proper IRQ domain to generic_handle_domain_irq()

Starting with commit dd26c1a23fd5 ("PCI: rcar-host: Switch to
msi_create_parent_irq_domain()"), the MSI parent IRQ domain is NULL because
the object of type struct irq_domain_info passed to:

msi_create_parent_irq_domain() -&gt;
  irq_domain_instantiate()() -&gt;
    __irq_domain_instantiate()

has no reference to the parent IRQ domain. Using msi-&gt;domain-&gt;parent as an
argument for generic_handle_domain_irq() leads to below error:

	"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address"

This error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host
controller driver to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a
similar pattern to handle MSIs (see link section)), but it was not tested
on hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver due to lack of
hardware.

bpf: Explicitly check accesses to bpf_sock_addr

Syzkaller found a kernel warning on the following sock_addr program:

    0: r0 = 0
    1: r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +60)
    2: exit

which triggers:

    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion (0)

This is happening because offset 60 in bpf_sock_addr corresponds to an
implicit padding of 4 bytes, right after msg_src_ip4. Access to this
padding isn't rejected in sock_addr_is_valid_access and it thus later
fails to convert the access.

This patch fixes it by explicitly checking the various fields of
bpf_sock_addr in sock_addr_is_valid_access.

I checked the other ctx structures and is_valid_access functions and
didn't find any other similar cases. Other cases of (properly handled)
padding are covered in new tests in a subsequent patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:55:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40079 | riscv, bpf: Sign extend struct ops return values properly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40079</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The bpf_fifo_dequeue prog returns a skb which is a pointer. The pointer
is treated as a 32bit value and sign extend to 64bit in epilogue. This
behavior is right for most bpf prog types but wrong for struct ops which
requires RISC-V ABI.

So let's sign extend struct ops return values according to the function
model and RISC-V ABI([0]).

When hfsplus_uni2asc is called from hfsplus_listxattr,
it actually passes in a struct hfsplus_attr_unistr*.
The size of the corresponding structure is different from that of hfsplus_unistr,
so the previous fix (94458781aee6) is insufficient.
The pointer on the unicode buffer is still going beyond the allocated memory.

This patch introduces two warpper functions hfsplus_uni2asc_xattr_str and
hfsplus_uni2asc_str to process two unicode buffers,
struct hfsplus_attr_unistr* and struct hfsplus_unistr* respectively.
When ustrlen value is bigger than the allocated memory size,
the ustrlen value is limited to an safe size.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9313 | Unauthorized database access in Asseco mMedica</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9313</link><description>An unauthenticated user can connect to a publicly accessible database using arbitrary credentials.

w/ a fuzzed image, f2fs may encounter panic due to it detects inconsistent
truncation range in direct node in f2fs_truncate_hole().

The root cause is: a non-inode dnode may has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid, so the dnode will be parsed as an inode, then ADDRS_PER_PAGE()
may return wrong blkaddr count which may be 923 typically, by chance,
dn.ofs_in_node is equal to 923, then count can be calculated to 0 in below
statement, later it will trigger panic w/ f2fs_bug_on(, count == 0 || ...).

	count = min(end_offset - dn.ofs_in_node, pg_end - pg_start);

This patch introduces a new node_type NODE_TYPE_NON_INODE, then allowing
passing the new_type to sanity_check_node_footer in f2fs_get_node_folio()
to detect corruption that a non-inode dnode has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid.

KVM: x86: Don't (re)check L1 intercepts when completing userspace I/O

When completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit
for I/O, don't recheck L1 intercepts as KVM has already finished that
phase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing L2
to perform I/O.  If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission
bitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being
intercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.

Pivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation.
Of the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the
intended "recipient") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s
use is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and
complete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with
EMULTYPE_SKIP.

The bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O
interception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN
on vcpu-&gt;arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation
of the I/O instruction.

This happens because of a race condition between:

- The 9p client sending an invalid flush request and later cleaning it up;
- The 9p client in p9_read_work() canceled all pending requests.

Commit 74d6a5d56629 ("9p/trans_fd: Fix concurrency del of req_list in
p9_fd_cancelled/p9_read_work") fixes a concurrency issue in the 9p filesystem
client where the req_list could be deleted simultaneously by both
p9_read_work and p9_fd_cancelled functions, but for the case where req-&gt;status
equals REQ_STATUS_RCVD.

Update the check for req-&gt;status in p9_fd_cancelled to skip processing not
just received requests, but anything that is not SENT, as whatever
changed the state from SENT also removed the request from its list.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

[updated the check from status == RECV || status == ERROR to status != SENT]</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 09:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40028 | binder: fix double-free in dbitmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix double-free in dbitmap

A process might fail to allocate a new bitmap when trying to expand its
proc-&gt;dmap. In that case, dbitmap_grow() fails and frees the old bitmap
via dbitmap_free(). However, the driver calls dbitmap_free() again when
the same process terminates, leading to a double-free error:

PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation or a whitelist, while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions using the victim’s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated. Laravel’s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections, and in the absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel’s origin/session checks, this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS deployments.

Pi-hole Admin Interface versions 6.2.1 and earlier are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via a malformed URL path. The 404 error page includes the requested path in the class attribute of the body tag without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker can craft a URL containing an onload attribute that will execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser when a victim visits the malicious link. If an attacker sends a crafted pi-hole link to a victim and the victim visits it, attacker-controlled JavaScript code is executed in the browser of the victim. This has been patched in version 6.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 19:15:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12307 | code-projects Nero Social Networking Site addfriend.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12307</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in code-projects Nero Social Networking Site 1.0.

The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression where the       rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the       possibility that, for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the       URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to bypass security       constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.



This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108.

Tomcat did not escape ANSI escape sequences in log messages. If Tomcat was running in a console on a Windows operating system, and the console supported ANSI escape sequences, it was possible for an attacker to use a specially crafted URL to inject ANSI escape sequences to manipulate the console and the clipboard and attempt to trick an administrator into running an attacker controlled command. While no attack vector was found, it may have been possible to mount this attack on other operating systems.

The affected version is langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite 2.0.10. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of filter operators ($eq, $ne, $gt, $lt, $gte, $lte) where direct string concatenation is used without proper parameterization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL, leading to unauthorized access to all documents, data exfiltration of sensitive fields such as passwords and API keys, and a complete bypass of application-level security filters.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 05:53:57 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
