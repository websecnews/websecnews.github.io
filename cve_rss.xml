This vulnerability exists because management interface ACLs have not been supported on Cisco IOS XR Software Packet I/O infrastructure platforms for Linux-handled features such as SSH, NetConf, or gRPC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ingress ACL that is applied on the management interface of the affected device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20248 | Cisco IOS XR Software Image Verification Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20248</link><description>A vulnerability in the installation process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass Cisco IOS XR Software image signature verification and load unsigned software on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system privileges on the affected device.

This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of files during the installation of an .iso file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying contents of the .iso image and then installing and activating it on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load an unsigned file as part of the image activation process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20340 | Cisco IOS XR Address Resolution Protocol Broadcast Storm Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20340</link><description>A vulnerability in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a broadcast storm, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&amp;nbsp;

This vulnerability is due to how Cisco IOS XR Software processes a high, sustained rate of ARP traffic hitting the management interface. Under certain conditions, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an excessive amount of traffic to the management interface of an affected device, overwhelming its ARP processing capabilities. A successful exploit could result in degraded device performance, loss of management connectivity, and complete unresponsiveness of the system, leading to a DoS condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43886 | Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, Hyper-V contain(s) a Path Traversal: '.../...//' vulnerability.

Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand` function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests recurring events in their expanded form using the `` element, the server stores all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible, implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43725 | Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerabi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43725</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability.

Himmelblau 0.9.x derives numeric GIDs for Entra ID groups from the group display name when himmelblau.conf `id_attr_map = name` (the default configuration). Because Microsoft Entra ID allows multiple groups with the same `displayName` (including end-user–created personal/O365 groups, depending on tenant policy), distinct directory groups can collapse to the same numeric GID on Linux. This issue only applies to Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.22. Any resource or service on a Himmelblau-joined host that enforces authorization by numeric GID (files/dirs, etc.) can be unintentionally accessible to a user who creates or joins a different Entra/O365 group that happens to share the same `displayName` as a privileged security group. Users should upgrade to 0.9.23, or 1.0.0 or later, to receive a patch. Group to GID mapping now uses Entra ID object IDs (GUIDs) and does not collide on same-name groups. As a workaround, use tenant policy hardening to restrict arbitrary group creation until all hosts are patched.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 22:42:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59046 | interactive-git-checkout has Command Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59046</link><description>The npm package `interactive-git-checkout` is an interactive command-line tool that allows users to checkout a git branch while it prompts for the branch name on the command-line.

Due to a special entry being appended to `sys.path` during the bootstrap process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present in `sys.path`, an application built with PyInstaller &lt; 6.0.0 may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code when **all** of the following conditions are met. First, the application is built with PyInstaller &lt; 6.0.0; both onedir and onefile mode are affected. Second, the optional bytecode encryption code feature was not enabled during the application build. Third, the attacker can create files/directories in the same directory where the executable is located. Fourth, the filesystem supports creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows systems). Fifth, the attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive is embedded in the executable. The attacker can create a directory (or a zip archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself. If the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation. PyInstaller 6.0.0 (f5adf291c8b832d5aff7632844f7e3ddf7ad4923) removed support for bytecode encryption; this effectively removes the described attack vector, due to the bootstrap script not attempting to load the optional module for bytecode-decryption anymore. PyInstaller 6.10.0 (cfd60b510f95f92cb81fc42735c399bb781a4739) reworked the bootstrap process to avoid (ab)using `sys.path` for transmitting location of the PYZ archive, which further eliminates the possibility of described injection procedure. If upgrading PyInstaller is not feasible, this issue can be worked around by ensuring proper permissions on directories containing security-sensitive executables (i.e., executables with `setuid` bit set) should mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 22:33:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58447 | rAthena has heap-based buffer overflow in login server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58447</link><description>rAthena is an open-source cross-platform massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) server.

An attacker published new versions of four of DuckDB's packages that included malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions* According to the npm statistics, nobody has downloaded these packages before they were deprecated.

DuckDB immediately deprecated the specific versions, engaged npm support to delete the affected verions, and re-released the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0).

A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:32:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58765 | wabac.js has XSS vulnerability in 404 error handling logic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58765</link><description>wabac.js provides a full web archive replay system, or 'wayback machine', using Service Workers.

Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit chain.

In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. Users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7635 | Calix GigaCenter ONT - Unauthenticated Telnet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7635</link><description>Unauthenticated Telnet access vulnerability in Calix GigaCenter ONT allows root access.This issue affects GigaCenter ONT: 844E, 844G, 844GE, 854GE.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34173 | Netgate pfSense CE Snort package v4.1.6_25 Directory Traversal Information Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34173</link><description>In pfSense CE /usr/local/www/snort/snort_ip_reputation.php, the value of the iplist parameter is not sanitized of directory traversal-related characters/strings before being used to check if a file exists.

The `/image` API endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. In Tautulli, the `/image` API endpoint is used to serve static images from the application's data directory to users. This endpoint can be accessed without authentication, and its intended purpose is for server background images and icons within the user interface. Attackers can exfiltrate files from the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application.

The `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories. An attacker can exfiltrate files on the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to upload a file under a specially crafted filename that will allow arbitrary command execution if said filename becomes included in a command defined in a system event handler and said event gets triggered. If no event handlers executing system commands with uploaded filenames as parameters have been configured, this vulnerability does not have an impact. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.11.3. As a workaround, OctoPrint administrators who have event handlers configured that include any kind of filename based placeholders should disable those by setting their `enabled` property to `False` or unchecking the "Enabled" checkbox in the GUI based Event Manager. Alternatively, OctoPrint administrators should set `feature.enforceReallyUniversalFilenames` to `true` in `config.yaml` and restart OctoPrint, then vet the existing uploads and make sure to delete any suspicious looking files. As always, OctoPrint administrators are advised to not expose OctoPrint on hostile networks like the public internet, and to vet who has access to their instance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:46:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58430 | listmonk Vulnerable to CSRF to XSS Chain That Can Lead to Admin Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58430</link><description>listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager.

Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32.

After a user authenticates from a specific IP address, the router grants access to any other client using that same IP, without requiring credentials or verifying client identity. There are no session tokens, cookies, or unique identifiers in place. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain full administrative access simply by configuring their device to use the same IP address as a previously authenticated user. This results in a complete authentication bypass.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:36:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43775 | Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.128, and Liferay DXP 2024.Q3.0 through 2024.Q3.5, 2024...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43775</link><description>Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.128, and Liferay DXP 2024.Q3.0 through 2024.Q3.5, 2024.Q2.0 through 2024.Q2.12, 2024.Q1.1 through 2024.Q1.12, and 7.4 GA through update 92 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via remote app title field.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57085 | Tenda W30E V16.01.0.19 (5037) was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the v17 parameter in the UploadCfg function.

The component passes user-controlled href values directly to underlying anchor elements without protocol validation, URL sanitization, or security headers. This allows attackers to inject malicious URLs using dangerous protocols (javascript:, data:, file:) or redirect users to external malicious sites. While native HTML anchor elements present similar risks, UI component libraries bear additional responsibility for implementing security safeguards and providing clear risk documentation. The vulnerability enables XSS attacks, phishing campaigns, and open redirect exploits affecting applications that use Element Plus Link components with user-controlled or untrusted URL inputs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:44:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10198 | LizardBytes Sunshine for Windows contains a DLL search-order hijacking vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10198</link><description>Sunshine for Windows, version v2025.122.141614, contains a DLL search-order hijacking vulnerability, allowing attackers to insert a malicious DLL in user-writeable PATH directories.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10199 | A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in LizardBytes&amp;#x27; Sunshine for Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10199</link><description>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Sunshine for Windows (version v2025.122.141614 and likely prior versions) due to an unquoted service path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57078 | Tenda G3 v3.0br_V15.11.0.17 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the pppoeServerWhiteMacIndex parameter in the formModifyPppAuthWhi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57078</link><description>Tenda G3 v3.0br_V15.11.0.17 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the pppoeServerWhiteMacIndex parameter in the formModifyPppAuthWhiteMac function.

Version 25.9.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:39:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57766 | Fides&amp;#x27;s Admin UI User Password Change Does Not Invalidate Current Session</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57766</link><description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, admin UI user password changes in Fides do not invalidate active user sessions, creating a vulnerability chaining opportunity where attackers who have obtained session tokens through other attack vectors (such as XSS) can maintain access even after password reset. This issue is not directly exploitable on its own and requires a prerequisite vulnerability to obtain valid session tokens in the first place. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:28:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57815 | Fides Lacks Brute-Force Protections on Authentication Endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57815</link><description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. For organizations with commercial Fides Enterprise licenses, configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) through an OIDC provider (like Azure, Google, or Okta) is an effective workaround. When OIDC SSO is enabled, username/password authentication can be disabled entirely, which eliminates this attack vector. This functionality is not available for Fides Open Source users.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:28:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57816 | Fides Webserver API Rate Limiting Vulnerability in Proxied Environments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57816</link><description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective in environments with CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service. This vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways, etc.) are not affected. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:28:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57817 | Fides Webserver API is Vulnerable to OAuth Client Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57817</link><description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the OAuth client creation and update endpoints of the Fides Webserver API do not properly authorize scope assignment. This allows highly privileged users with `client:create` or `client:update` permissions to escalate their privileges to owner-level. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue.

Prior to version 9.14, the blog application in XWiki allowed remote code execution for any user who has edit right on any page. Normally, these are all logged-in users as they can edit their own user profile. For an exploit, it is sufficient to add an object of type `Blog.BlogPostClass` to any page and to add some script macro with the exploit code to the "Content" field of that object. The vulnerability has been patched in the blog application version 9.14 by executing the content of blog posts with the rights of the appropriate author.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 2.1.9 that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser when the malicious link is clicked. This is a one-click XSS, meaning the victim only needs to click a crafted link — no further interaction is required. The application contains a stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient filtering and escaping of user-supplied data inserted into link attributes. Malicious JavaScript code can be saved in the database along with the link and executed in the user’s browser when clicking the link, leading to arbitrary script execution within the context of the site. Version 2.1.9 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:28:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48341 | dingfanzu CMS V1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=addShop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48341</link><description>dingfanzu CMS V1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=addShop</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:18:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10103 | code-projects Online Event Judging System home.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10103</link><description>A weakness has been identified in code-projects Online Event Judging System 1.0.
