Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.

When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.

Memory can only be recovered by manually restarting bbe-smgd.

This issue only occurs if BFD liveness detection for DHCP subscribers is enabled. Systems without BFD liveness detection enabled are not vulnerable to this issue.

Indication of the issue can be observed by periodically executing the 'show system processes extensive' command, which will indicate an increase in memory allocation for bbe-smgd. A small amount of memory is leaked every time a DHCP subscriber logs in, which will become visible over time, ultimately leading to memory starvation.

If the "tcp-reset" option is added to the "reject" action in an IPv6 filter which matches on "payload-protocol", packets are permitted instead of rejected. This happens because the payload-protocol match criteria is not supported in the kernel filter causing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. As a fix the payload-protocol match will be treated the same as a "next-header" match to avoid this filter bypass.

This issue doesn't affect IPv4 firewall filters.

An attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of PATH_CHALLENGE frames. The receiver is supposed to respond to each PATH_CHALLENGE frame with a PATH_RESPONSE frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these PATH_RESPONSE frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 0.37.7, 0.38.2 and 0.39.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:49:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21638 | Azure IPAM solution Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21638</link><description>Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:49:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51123 | An issue discovered in D-Link dir815 v.1.01SSb08.bin allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted POST request to the se...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51123</link><description>An issue discovered in D-Link dir815 v.1.01SSb08.bin allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted POST request to the service parameter in the soapcgi_main function of the cgibin binary component.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:39:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0333 | Insufficient data validation in Extensions in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.216 allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0333</link><description>Insufficient data validation in Extensions in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.216 allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to install a malicious extension via a crafted HTML page.

It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:54:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37934 | An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacke...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37934</link><description>An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability [CWE-770] in FortiPAM 1.0 all versions allows an authenticated attacker to perform a denial of service attack via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests in a high frequency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-44250 | An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a For...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44250</link><description>An improper privilege management vulnerability [CWE-269] in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a FortiProxy HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 allows an authenticated attacker to perform elevated actions via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46712 | A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46712</link><description>A improper access control in Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, Fortinet FortiPortal version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 allows attacker to escalate its privilege via specifically crafted HTTP requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48783 | An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48783</link><description>An Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability [CWE-639] affecting PortiPortal version 7.2.1 and below, version 7.0.6 and below, version 6.0.14 and below, version 5.3.8 and below may allow a remote authenticated user with at least read-only permissions to access to other organization endpoints via crafted GET requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 18:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37932 | An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37932</link><description>An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') vulnerability [CWE-22] in FortiVoiceEntreprise version 7.0.0 and before 6.4.7 allows an authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the system via sending crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 17:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-29444 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element in PTC&amp;#x27;s Kepware KEPServerEX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29444</link><description>An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability (DLL hijacking) has been discovered that could allow a locally authenticated adversary to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.
