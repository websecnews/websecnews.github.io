Markdown-based comments in the ZenUML diagram syntax are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The comment feature allows the user to attach small notes for reference. This feature allows the user to enter in their comment in markdown comment, allowing them to use common markdown features, such as `**` for bolded text. However, the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering, allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS. This puts existing applications that use ZenUML unsandboxed at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering user-controlled diagrams.

This issue is compounded by the bypass of input filtering in the `install_binding`, `reinstall_binding`, and `unInstall_binding` endpoints, despite the presence of a `sanitize_path_from_endpoint(data.name)` filter. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload and execute malicious code on the victim's system, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 20:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4885 | WhatsUp Gold GetFileWithoutZip Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4885</link><description>In WhatsUp Gold versions released before 2023.1.3, an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Progress WhatsUpGold.  The

x86/xen: Drop USERGS_SYSRET64 paravirt call

commit afd30525a659ac0ae0904f0cb4a2ca75522c3123 upstream.

USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, but
a Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as there
is no sysret PV hypercall defined.

So instead of testing all the prerequisites for doing a sysret and
then mangling the stack for Xen PV again for doing an iret just use
the iret exit from the beginning.

This can easily be done via an ALTERNATIVE like it is done for the
sysenter compat case already.

It should be noted that this drops the optimization in Xen for not
restoring a few registers when returning to user mode, but it seems
as if the saved instructions in the kernel more than compensate for
this drop (a kernel build in a Xen PV guest was slightly faster with
this patch applied).

While at it remove the stale sysret32 remnants.

  [ pawan: Brad Spengler and Salvatore Bonaccorso 
	   reported a problem with the 5.10 backport commit edc702b4a820
	   ("x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition").

	   When CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y, CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS is not executed in
	   syscall_return_via_sysret path as USERGS_SYSRET64 is runtime
	   patched to:

	.cpu_usergs_sysret64    = { 0x0f, 0x01, 0xf8,
				    0x48, 0x0f, 0x07 }, // swapgs; sysretq

	   which is missing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS. It turns out dropping
	   USERGS_SYSRET64 simplifies the code, allowing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS
	   to be explicitly added to syscall_return_via_sysret path. Below
	   is with CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y and this patch applied:

	   syscall_return_via_sysret:
	   ...

This is because when the log writer starts a writeback for segment summary
blocks or a super root block that use the backing device's page cache, it
does not wait for the ongoing folio/page writeback, resulting in an
inconsistent writeback state.

Fix this issue by waiting for ongoing writebacks when putting
folios/pages on the backing device into writeback state.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37354 | btrfs: fix crash on racing fsync and size-extending write into prealloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37354</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  page dumped because: non-NULL mapping

[CAUSE]
Commit 09e6cef19c9f ("btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() to
allocate-then-attach method") changes the sequence when allocating a new
extent buffer.

Previously we always called grab_extent_buffer() under
mapping-&gt;i_private_lock, to ensure the safety on modification on
folio::private (which is a pointer to extent buffer for regular
sectorsize).

This can lead to the following race:

Thread A is trying to allocate an extent buffer at bytenr X, with 4
4K pages, meanwhile thread B is trying to release the page at X + 4K
(the second page of the extent buffer at X).

           Thread A                |                 Thread B
-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------
                                   | btree_release_folio()
				   | | This is for the page at X + 4K,
				   | | Not page X.
				   | |
alloc_extent_buffer()              | |- release_extent_buffer()
|- filemap_add_folio() for the     | |  |- atomic_dec_and_test(eb-&gt;refs)
|  page at bytenr X (the first     | |  |
|  page).                          | |  |
|  Which returned -EEXIST.         | |  |
|                                  | |  |
|- filemap_lock_folio()            | |  |
|  Returned the first page locked. | |  |
|                                  | |  |
|- grab_extent_buffer()            | |  |
|  |- atomic_inc_not_zero()        | |  |
|  |  Returned false               | |  |
|  |- folio_detach_private()       | |  |- folio_detach_private() for X
|     |- folio_test_private()      | |     |- folio_test_private()
      |  Returned true             | |     |  Returned true
      |- folio_put()               |       |- folio_put()

Now there are two puts on the same folio at folio X, leading to refcount
underflow of the folio X, and eventually causing the BUG_ON() on the
page-&gt;mapping.

The condition is not that easy to hit:

- The release must be triggered for the middle page of an eb
  If the release is on the same first page of an eb, page lock would kick
  in and prevent the race.

- folio_detach_private() has a very small race window
  It's only between folio_test_private() and folio_clear_private().

That's exactly when mapping-&gt;i_private_lock is used to prevent such race,
and commit 09e6cef19c9f ("btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() to
allocate-then-attach method") screwed that up.

At that time, I thought the page lock would kick in as
filemap_release_folio() also requires the page to be locked, but forgot
the filemap_release_folio() only locks one page, not all pages of an
extent buffer.

[FIX]
Move all the code requiring i_private_lock into
attach_eb_folio_to_filemap(), so that everything is done with proper
lock protection.

Furthermore to prevent future problems, add an extra
lockdep_assert_locked() to ensure we're holding the proper lock.

To reproducer that is able to hit the race (takes a few minutes with
instrumented code inserting delays to alloc_extent_buffer()):

  #!/bin/sh
  drop_caches () {
	  while(true); do
		  echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
		  echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
	  done
  }

  run_tar () {
	  while(true); do
		  for x in `seq 1 80` ; do
			  tar cf /dev/zero /mnt &gt; /dev/null &amp;
		  done
		  wait
	  done
  }

irq_find_at_or_after() dereferences the interrupt descriptor which is

lock, which means the descriptor can be freed between mt_find() and the
dereference:

occured when /sys/bus/ap/a[pq]mask was updated with a relative mask value

The fix is simple: use unsigned long values for the internal variables. The
correct checks are already in place in the function but a simple int for
the internal variables was used with the possibility to overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39276 | ext4: fix mb_cache_entry&amp;#x27;s e_refcnt leak in ext4_xattr_block_cache_find()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39276</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because when finding an entry in ext4_xattr_block_cache_find(), if
ext4_sb_bread() returns -ENOMEM, the ce's e_refcnt, which has already grown

issue in mb_cache_destroy() due to reference count leakage.

So call mb_cache_entry_put() on the -ENOMEM error branch as a quick fix.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39293 | Revert &amp;quot;xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39293</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.

This patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances
redirect to the same AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is
possible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,
which will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when
flushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked list of
sockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix
is not possible, so let us revert this for now.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39296 | bonding: fix oops during rmmod</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39296</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: fix oops during rmmod

"rmmod bonding" causes an oops ever since commit cc317ea3d927 ("bonding:
remove redundant NULL check in debugfs function").  Here are the relevant
functions being called:

bonding_exit()
  bond_destroy_debugfs()
    debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);
    bonding_debug_root = NULL; &lt;--------- SET TO NULL HERE
  bond_netlink_fini()
    rtnl_link_unregister()
      __rtnl_link_unregister()
        unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
          bond_uninit()
            bond_debug_unregister()
              (commit removed check for bonding_debug_root == NULL)
              debugfs_remove()
              simple_recursive_removal()
                down_write() -&gt; OOPS

However, reverting the bad commit does not solve the problem completely
because the original code contains a race that could cause the same
oops, although it was much less likely to be triggered unintentionally:

CPU1
  rmmod bonding
    bonding_exit()
      bond_destroy_debugfs()
        debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);

CPU2
  echo -bond0 &gt; /sys/class/net/bonding_masters
    bond_uninit()
      bond_debug_unregister()
        if (!bonding_debug_root)

CPU1
        bonding_debug_root = NULL;

So do NOT revert the bad commit (since the removed checks were racy
anyway), and instead change the order of actions taken during module
removal.  The same oops can also happen if there is an error during
module init, so apply the same fix there.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39298 | mm/memory-failure: fix handling of dissolved but not taken off from buddy pages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39298</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If p9_check_errors() fails early in p9_client_rpc(), req-&gt;rc.tag
will not be properly initialized. However, trace_9p_client_res()
ends up trying to print it out anyway before p9_client_rpc()
finishes.

Fix this issue by assigning default values to p9_fcall fields
such as 'tag' and (just in case KMSAN unearths something new) 'id'
during the tag allocation stage.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39362 | i2c: acpi: Unbind mux adapters before delete</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39362</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: acpi: Unbind mux adapters before delete

There is an issue with ACPI overlay table removal specifically related
to I2C multiplexers.

Consider an ACPI SSDT Overlay that defines a PCA9548 I2C mux on an
existing I2C bus. When this table is loaded we see the creation of a
device for the overall PCA9548 chip and 8 further devices - one
i2c_adapter each for the mux channels. These are all bound to their
ACPI equivalents via an eventual invocation of acpi_bind_one().

When we unload the SSDT overlay we run into the problem. The ACPI
devices are deleted as normal via acpi_device_del_work_fn() and the
acpi_device_del_list.

However, the following warning and stack trace is output as the
deletion does not go smoothly:

repeated 7 more times, 1 for each channel of the mux
...

The issue is that the binding of the ACPI devices to their peer I2C
adapters is not correctly cleaned up. Digging deeper into the issue we
see that the deletion order is such that the ACPI devices matching the
mux channel i2c adapters are deleted first during the SSDT overlay
removal. For each of the channels we see a call to i2c_acpi_notify()
with ACPI_RECONFIG_DEVICE_REMOVE but, because these devices are not
actually i2c_clients, nothing is done for them.

Later on, after each of the mux channels has been dealt with, we come
to delete the i2c_client representing the PCA9548 device. This is the
call stack we see above, whereby the kernel cleans up the i2c_client
including destruction of the mux and its channel adapters. At this
point we do attempt to unbind from the ACPI peers but those peers

because the request is marked forced ASYNC and has a bad file fd, and
hence takes the forced async prep path.

Current kernels with the request async prep cleaned up can no longer hit
this issue, but for ease of backporting, let's add this safety check in
here too as it really doesn't hurt. For both cases, this will inevitably
end with a CQE posted with -EBADF.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39461 | clk: bcm: rpi: Assign -&amp;gt;num before accessing -&amp;gt;hws</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39461</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors

The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read
fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the
folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely
determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.

In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a
failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop
with I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing the
log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.

Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false
value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 14:31:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39470 | eventfs: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in eventfs_find_events()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39470</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality 
through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
 LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with 
documents.

LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.

In
 affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode 
only, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled 
(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)

In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.

This issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 13:02:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4846 | Authentication bypass in the 2FA feature in Devolutions Server 2024.1.14.0 and earlier allows an authenticated attacker to authenticate to a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4846</link><description>Authentication bypass in the 2FA feature in Devolutions Server 2024.1.14.0 and earlier allows an authenticated attacker to authenticate to another user without being asked for the 2FA via another browser tab.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 12:47:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28831 | XSS in confirmation pop-up</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28831</link><description>Stored XSS in some confirmation pop-ups in Checkmk before versions 2.3.0p7 and 2.2.0p28 allows Checkmk users to execute arbitrary scripts by injecting HTML elements into some user input fields that are shown in a confirmation pop-up.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 11:52:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28832 | XSS in Crash Report Page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28832</link><description>Stored XSS in the Crash Report page in Checkmk before versions 2.3.0p7, 2.2.0p28, 2.1.0p45, and 2.0.0 (EOL) allows users with permission to change Global Settings to execute arbitrary scripts by injecting HTML elements into the Crash Report URL in the Global Settings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 11:52:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6305 | WordPress Core &amp;lt; 6.5.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Template Part Block</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6305</link><description>WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Template Part Block in various versions up to 6.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'tagName' attributes.
