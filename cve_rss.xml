Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess` method within the authorization middleware, which fails to adequately verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project. Instead, it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the project, overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project` table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to gain complete control over all resources within a project, including the ability to create, update, read, and delete any resource, compromising the privacy and security of sensitive information.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 19:52:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4680 | Insufficient Session Expiration in zenml-io/zenml</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4680</link><description>A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically, the session does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 19:52:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21748 | WordPress Icegram Engage plugin &amp;lt;= 3.1.21 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21748</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Icegram.This issue affects Icegram: from n/a through 3.1.21.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22151 | WordPress Import and export users and customers plugin &amp;lt;= 1.24.6 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22151</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Codection Import and export users and customers.This issue affects Import and export users and customers: from n/a through 1.24.6.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35657 | WordPress WP-Recall plugin &amp;lt;= 16.26.6 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35657</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Plechev Andrey WP-Recall.This issue affects WP-Recall: from n/a through 16.26.6.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35659 | WordPress KiviCare plugin &amp;lt;= 3.6.2 - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35659</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in KiviCare.This issue affects KiviCare: from n/a through 3.6.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35675 | WordPress Advanced Woo Labels plugin &amp;lt;= 1.93 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35675</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in ILLID Advanced Woo Labels allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Advanced Woo Labels: from n/a through 1.93.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35676 | WordPress Recurring PayPal Donations plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35676</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in wpecommerce Recurring PayPal Donations allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Recurring PayPal Donations: from n/a through 1.7.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:26:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35678 | WordPress Contact Form to DB by BestWebSoft plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.2  - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35678</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in BestWebSoft Contact Form to DB by BestWebSoft.This issue affects Contact Form to DB by BestWebSoft: from n/a through 1.7.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 16:01:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45707 | HCL Connections Docs is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45707</link><description>HCL Connections Docs is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack where an attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code.

This appears to work around a deadlock regression that came in
with the LED merge in 6.9.

The deadlock happens on my system with 24 iwlwifi radios, so maybe
it something like all worker threads are busy and some work that needs
to complete cannot complete.

remoteproc: mediatek: Make sure IPI buffer fits in L2TCM

The IPI buffer location is read from the firmware that we load to the
System Companion Processor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM
(L2TCM) size that is defined in the devicetree node is large enough
for that, and while this is especially true for multi-core SCP, it's
still useful to check on single-core variants as well.

Failing to perform this check may make this driver perform R/W
operations out of the L2TCM boundary, resulting (at best) in a
kernel panic.

To fix that, check that the IPI buffer fits, otherwise return a
failure and refuse to boot the relevant SCP core (or the SCP at
all, if this is single core).</description><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 13:21:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36966 | erofs: reliably distinguish block based and fscache mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36966</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

l2cap_le_flowctl_init() can cause both div-by-zero and an integer
overflow since hdev-&gt;le_mtu may not fall in the valid range.

Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connection
process earlier if MTU is invalid.
Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it return
an error value if the validation fails.
Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a
kzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.

drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config

When slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation
of the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This
leaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a
check to avoid the division by zero.

The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on
a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor
connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception
when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.

After applying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitor
is connected and the system is rebooted. I believe this is the same

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of tile list data within AV1-encoded video files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
