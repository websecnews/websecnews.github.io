crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled

The generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can
be reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:

    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 &gt; OUTFILE

The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all
zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
'val &amp; PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.

Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns
with a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have
qcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.

Here's some statistics from the ent project
(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
quality of the generated numbers:

    $ ent -c qcom-random-before

    Total:       9000000   1.000000

    Entropy = 7.811590 bits per byte.

    Optimum compression would reduce the size
    of this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.

    Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and
    randomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the
    times.

    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random).
    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent).
    Serial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =
    0.0).

Without this patch, the results of the chi-square test is 0.01%, and
the numbers are certainly not random according to ent's project page.
The results improve with this patch:

    would exceed this value 42.24 percent of the times.

crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ

The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:

    kcapi-rng -b 67 &gt;/dev/null

There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.

ice: xsk: return xsk buffers back to pool when cleaning the ring

Currently we only NULL the xdp_buff pointer in the internal SW ring but
we never give it back to the xsk buffer pool. This means that buffers
can be leaked out of the buff pool and never be used again.

Add missing xsk_buff_free() call to the routine that is supposed to
clean the entries that are left in the ring so that these buffers in the
umem can be used by other sockets.

Also, only go through the space that is actually left to be cleaned
instead of a whole ring.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47106 | netfilter: nf_tables: fix use-after-free in nft_set_catchall_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Fix READDIR buffer overflow

If a client sends a READDIR count argument that is too small (say,
zero), then the buffer size calculation in the new init_dirlist
helper functions results in an underflow, allowing the XDR stream
functions to write beyond the actual buffer.

This calculation has always been suspect. NFSD has never sanity-
checked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encoders
managed the problem correctly.

With the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the
underflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().

Modern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possible
for each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests that
exercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count
values. Thus this case was missed during testing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47108 | drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47108</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

In commit 41ca9caaae0b
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a check
for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
in order to address possible issues on MT8167;
moreover, with commit c91026a938c2
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock")
another similar check was introduced.

Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide
any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL
pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as
soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.

To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi-&gt;conf in the
said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
kernel panics.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47082 | tun: avoid double free in tun_free_netdev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47082</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tun: avoid double free in tun_free_netdev

Avoid double free in tun_free_netdev() by moving the
dev-&gt;tstats and tun-&gt;security allocs to a new ndo_init routine
(tun_net_init()) that will be called by register_netdevice().
ndo_init is paired with the desctructor (tun_free_netdev()),
so if there's an error in register_netdevice() the destructor
will handle the frees.

Even though there are two synchronization primitives before the kfree:
1. wait_for_completion(&amp;ax-&gt;dead). This can prevent the race with
routines from mkiss_ioctl. However, it cannot stop the routine coming
from upper layer, i.e., the ax25_sendmsg.

2. netif_stop_queue(ax-&gt;dev). It seems that this line of code aims to
halt the transmit queue but it fails to stop the routine that already
being xmit.

This patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid the
possible UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won't
return if there is a running routine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:17:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47085 | hamradio: improve the incomplete fix to avoid NPD</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47085</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hamradio: improve the incomplete fix to avoid NPD

The previous commit 3e0588c291d6 ("hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after
unregister_netdev") reorder the kfree operations and unregister_netdev
operation to prevent UAF.

This commit improves the previous one by also deferring the nullify of
the ax-&gt;tty pointer. Otherwise, a NULL pointer dereference bug occurs.

commands:

	cat /sys/kernel/debug/kfence/objects
	echo scan &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
	cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

The leaked memory is allocated in the stack below:

    do_syscall_64
      do_sys_open
        do_dentry_open
          full_proxy_open

And it should have been released in the following process:

    do_syscall_64
      syscall_exit_to_user_mode
        exit_to_user_mode_prepare
          task_work_run

However, the release function corresponding to file_operations is not
implemented in kfence.  As a result, a memory leak occurs.  Therefore,
the solution to this problem is to implement the corresponding release
function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:17:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47090 | mm/hwpoison: clear MF_COUNT_INCREASED before retrying get_any_page()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Always clear vmx-&gt;fail on emulation_required

Revert a relatively recent change that set vmx-&gt;fail if the vCPU is in L2
and emulation_required is true, as that behavior is completely bogus.
Setting vmx-&gt;fail and synthesizing a VM-Exit is contradictory and wrong:

  (a) it's impossible to have both a VM-Fail and VM-Exit
  (b) vmcs.EXIT_REASON is not modified on VM-Fail
  (c) emulation_required refers to guest state and guest state checks are
      always VM-Exits, not VM-Fails.

For KVM specifically, emulation_required is handled before nested exits
in __vmx_handle_exit(), thus setting vmx-&gt;fail has no immediate effect,
i.e. KVM calls into handle_invalid_guest_state() and vmx-&gt;fail is ignored.
Setting vmx-&gt;fail can ultimately result in a WARN in nested_vmx_vmexit()
firing when tearing down the VM as KVM never expects vmx-&gt;fail to be set
when L2 is active, KVM always reflects those errors into L1.

KVM: x86/mmu: Don't advance iterator after restart due to yielding

After dropping mmu_lock in the TDP MMU, restart the iterator during
tdp_iter_next() and do not advance the iterator.  Advancing the iterator
results in skipping the top-level SPTE and all its children, which is
fatal if any of the skipped SPTEs were not visited before yielding.

When zapping all SPTEs, i.e. when min_level == root_level, restarting the
iter and then invoking tdp_iter_next() is always fatal if the current gfn
has as a valid SPTE, as advancing the iterator results in try_step_side()
skipping the current gfn, which wasn't visited before yielding.

Sprinkle WARNs on iter-&gt;yielded being true in various helpers that are
often used in conjunction with yielding, and tag the helper with
__must_check to reduce the probabily of improper usage.

Failing to zap a top-level SPTE manifests in one of two ways.  If a valid
SPTE is skipped by both kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() and kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(),
the shadow page will be leaked and KVM will WARN accordingly.

If kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() skips a gfn/SPTE but that SPTE is then zapped by
kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(), KVM triggers a use-after-free in the form of

Note, the underlying bug existed even before commit 1af4a96025b3 ("KVM:
x86/mmu: Yield in TDU MMU iter even if no SPTES changed") moved calls to
tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() to the beginning of loops, as KVM could still
incorrectly advance past a top-level entry when yielding on a lower-level
entry.  But with respect to leaking shadow pages, the bug was introduced
by yielding before processing the current gfn.

Alternatively, tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() could simply fall through, or
callers could jump to their "retry" label.  The downside of that approach
is that tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() _must_ be called before anything else
in the loop, and there's no easy way to enfornce that requirement.

Ideally, KVM would handling the cond_resched() fully within the iterator
macro (the code is actually quite clean) and avoid this entire class of
bugs, but that is extremely difficult do wh

ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion

The user_pversion was uninitialized for the user space file structure
in the open function, because the file private structure use
kmalloc for the allocation.

The kernel ALSA sequencer code clears the file structure, so no additional
fixes are required.

Input: elantech - fix stack out of bound access in elantech_change_report_id()

The array param[] in elantech_change_report_id() must be at least 3
bytes, because elantech_read_reg_params() is calling ps2_command() with
PSMOUSE_CMD_GETINFO, that is going to access 3 bytes from param[], but
it's defined in the stack as an array of 2 bytes, therefore we have a
potential stack out-of-bounds access here, also confirmed by KASAN:

hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations

Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of
temperature calculations") addressed a number of underflow situations
when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen
when an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the
critical temperature limit is negative.

Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that
the provided value can never overflow or underflow.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 18:17:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47099 | veth: ensure skb entering GRO are not cloned.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47099</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

veth: ensure skb entering GRO are not cloned.

After commit d3256efd8e8b ("veth: allow enabling NAPI even without XDP"),
if GRO is enabled on a veth device and TSO is disabled on the peer
device, TCP skbs will go through the NAPI callback. If there is no XDP
program attached, the veth code does not perform any share check, and
shared/cloned skbs could enter the GRO engine.

Ignat reported a BUG triggered later-on due to the above condition:

Address the issue by skipping the GRO stage for shared or cloned skbs.
To reduce the chance of OoO, try to unclone the skbs before giving up.

net: marvell: prestera: fix incorrect structure access

In line:
	upper = info-&gt;upper_dev;
We access upper_dev field, which is related only for particular events
(e.g. event == NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER). So, this line cause invalid memory
access for another events,
when ptr is not netdev_notifier_changeupper_info.

inet: fully convert sk-&gt;sk_rx_dst to RCU rules

syzbot reported various issues around early demux,
one being included in this changelog [1]

sk-&gt;sk_rx_dst is using RCU protection without clearly
documenting it.

And following sequences in tcp_v4_do_rcv()/tcp_v6_do_rcv()
are not following standard RCU rules.

[a]    dst_release(dst);
[b]    sk-&gt;sk_rx_dst = NULL;

They look wrong because a delete operation of RCU protected
pointer is supposed to clear the pointer before
the call_rcu()/synchronize_rcu() guarding actual memory freeing.

In some cases indeed, dst could be freed before [b] is done.

We could cheat by clearing sk_rx_dst before calling
dst_release(), but this seems the right time to stick
to standard RCU annotations and debugging facilities.

tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head-&gt;write_buf when write()
of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head-&gt;write_buf after
head-&gt;io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can
cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 07:13:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20005 | In da, there is a possible permission bypass due to a missing permission check.
