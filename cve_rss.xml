It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. The wazuh-agent for Windows is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to improper ACL of the non-default installation directory. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing one of the many DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder of the agent OR by replacing the service executable binary itself with a malicious one. The root cause is an improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified (e.g,: C:\wazuh). Many DLLs are loaded from the installation folder and by creating a malicious DLLs that exports the functions of a legit one (and that is not found on the system where the agent is installed, such as rsync.dll) it is possible to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user and obtain code execution under the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 21:42:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47770 | Ability to view Agent list with no privilege access in wazuh-dashboard</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47770</link><description>Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. This vulnerability occurs when the system has weak privilege access, that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation. In this case the attacker is able to view agent list on Wazuh dashboard with no privilege access. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.9.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 21:42:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22129 | Initial effort field does not respect field permissions in the Taskboard REST card representation in Tuleap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22129</link><description>Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration.

In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X &gt; Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.1 and 0.38.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. Operators may attempt to ban malicious peers from the network as a workaround.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 21:27:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52163 | Digiever DS-2105 Pro 3.1.0.71-11 devices allow time_tzsetup.cgi Command Injection.

Affected versions of Django-Unicorn are vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status. With this finding at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been observed, stably resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application. This issue has been addressed in version 0.62.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 21:15:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24899 | Disclosure of Sensitive User Information via API in reNgine</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24899</link><description>reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications.

An attacker with control over environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables into `process.env`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution or unexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment variables for security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input and pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. If upgrading is not feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing user-controlled environment variable values before passing them to `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `"`, `'`, and backticks in values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 20:58:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24960 | Missing Input validation for filename in backups endpoint in Jellystat</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24960</link><description>Jellystat is a free and open source Statistics App for Jellyfin.

This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 20:52:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24961 | Insecure path traversal in filesystem and filesystem-nio2 storage backends in org.gaul S3Proxy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24961</link><description>org.gaul S3Proxy implements the S3 API and proxies requests.

In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:14:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53943 | An issue was discovered in NRadio N8-180 NROS-1.9.2.n3.c5 devices.

It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor 5 module.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 03:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25063 | An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3.

It does not sufficiently validate uploaded SVG images to ensure they do not contain potentially dangerous SVG tags. SVG images can contain clickable links and executable scripting, and using a crafted SVG, it is possible to execute scripting in the browser when an SVG image is viewed. This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing to be able to upload SVG images, and that Backdrop embeds all uploaded SVG images within &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags, which prevents scripting from executing. The SVG must be viewed directly by its URL in order to run any embedded scripting.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 03:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20141 | In V5 DA, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
