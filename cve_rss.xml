drm/panthor: Prevent potential UAF in group creation

This commit prevents the possibility of a use after free issue in the
GROUP_CREATE ioctl function, which arose as pointer to the group is
accessed in that ioctl function after storing it in the Xarray.
A malicious userspace can second guess the handle of a group and try
to call GROUP_DESTROY ioctl from another thread around the same time
as GROUP_CREATE ioctl.

To prevent the use after free exploit, this commit uses a mark on an
entry of group pool Xarray which is added just before returning from
the GROUP_CREATE ioctl function. The mark is checked for all ioctls
that specify the group handle and so userspace won't be abe to delete
a group that isn't marked yet.

landlock: Fix handling of disconnected directories

Disconnected files or directories can appear when they are visible and
opened from a bind mount, but have been renamed or moved from the source
of the bind mount in a way that makes them inaccessible from the mount
point (i.e. out of scope).

Previously, access rights tied to files or directories opened through a
disconnected directory were collected by walking the related hierarchy
down to the root of the filesystem, without taking into account the
mount point because it couldn't be found. This could lead to
inconsistent access results, potential access right widening, and
hard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot be printed.

For a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to
have write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to
the underlying source of the bind mount, and read access to the related
mount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access
rights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to
inconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be
inherited from the mount point hierarchy, while inheriting permissions
from the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.

Landlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected
directories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the
mount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also always taking
into account the mount point from which these disconnected directories
were opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would
widen access rights [1].

The rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be
visible or accessible to a sandboxed task, relying on the collected
access rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will
not be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison
between the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).
It may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and
directories, but the security policies are always enforced for all the
evaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to
users and safer from an access control perspective.

Remove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and
fix the related comment.

Because opened files have their access rights stored in the related file
security properties, there is no impact for disconnected or unlinked
files.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68737 | arm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68737</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

must take appropriate action; currently we are suppressing the error, and

ima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()

In ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to
the rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check
and sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing
extra files to be measured by IMA.

This issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:
After unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA
measurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,
in ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &amp;&amp;
!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In
ima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule
becomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix improper freeing of purex item

In qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated via
qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls
qla24xx_alloc_purex_item().

The qla24xx_alloc_purex_item() function may return a pre-allocated item
from a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead of dynamically
allocating memory with kzalloc().

An error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb() incorrectly uses
kfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated
pool, calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.

Fix this by using the correct deallocation function,
qla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically
allocated and pre-allocated items.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68742 | bpf: Fix invalid prog-&amp;gt;stats access when update_effective_progs fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68742</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix invalid prog-&gt;stats access when update_effective_progs fails

Syzkaller triggers an invalid memory access issue following fault
injection in update_effective_progs. The issue can be described as
follows:

__cgroup_bpf_detach
  update_effective_progs
    compute_effective_progs
      bpf_prog_array_alloc &lt;-- fault inject
  purge_effective_progs
    /* change to dummy_bpf_prog */
    array-&gt;items[index] = &amp;dummy_bpf_prog.prog

---softirq start---
__do_softirq
  ...
    __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb
      __bpf_prog_run_save_cb
        bpf_prog_run
          stats = this_cpu_ptr(prog-&gt;stats)
          /* invalid memory access */
          flags = u64_stats_update_begin_irqsave(&amp;stats-&gt;syncp)
---softirq end---

  static_branch_dec(&amp;cgroup_bpf_enabled_key[atype])

The reason is that fault injection caused update_effective_progs to fail
and then changed the original prog into dummy_bpf_prog.prog in
purge_effective_progs. Then a softirq came, and accessing the members of
dummy_bpf_prog.prog in the softirq triggers invalid mem access.

To fix it, skip updating stats when stats is NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68743 | mshv: Fix create memory region overlap check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

As [lru_,]percpu_hash maps support BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU}, missing

'copy_map_value[,_long]()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()'.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68745 | scsi: qla2xxx: Clear cmds after chip reset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68745</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Clear cmds after chip reset

Commit aefed3e5548f ("scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port handling

1. Commands sent to FW, after chip reset got stuck and never freed as FW
   is not going to respond to them anymore.

2. BUG_ON(cmd-&gt;sg_mapped) in qlt_free_cmd().  Commit 26f9ce53817a
   ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands")
   attempted to fix this, but introduced another bug under different
   circumstances when two different CPUs were racing to call
   qlt_unmap_sg() at the same time: BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(dir)) in
   dma_unmap_sg_attrs().

So revert "scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands" and
partially revert "scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port handling and

spi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling

When the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)
is excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not
running before the transfer timeout is reached.

While handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and
the message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves
the curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.

To avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this
condition when the IRQ thread is finally run.

While at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new
interrupts can be run.

A better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a
hard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ
thread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the
extra check for a valid transfer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68747 | drm/panthor: Fix UAF on kernel BO VA nodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If the MMU is down, panthor_vm_unmap_range() might return an error.
We expect the page table to be updated still, and if the MMU is blocked,

physical memory returned to the system (which the current code doesn't
cover for anyway).

the va_node inserted in the drm_mm, which leads to UAF when other
adjacent nodes are removed from the drm_mm tree.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68748 | drm/panthor: Fix UAF race between device unplug and FW event processing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68748</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It was found that within a critical section of spin_lock_irqsave in
sidtab_context_to_sid(), convert_context() (hooked by
sidtab_convert_params.func) might cause the process to sleep via
allocating memory with GFP_KERNEL, which is problematic.

As Ondrej pointed out [1], convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func
has another caller sidtab_convert_tree(), which is okay with GFP_KERNEL.
Therefore, fix this problem by adding a gfp_t argument for
convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func and pass GFP_KERNEL/_ATOMIC
properly in individual callers.

wifi: ath10k: Delay the unmapping of the buffer

On WCN3990, we are seeing a rare scenario where copy engine hardware is
sending a copy complete interrupt to the host driver while still
processing the buffer that the driver has sent, this is leading into an
SMMU fault triggering kernel panic. This is happening on copy engine
channel 3 (CE3) where the driver normally enqueues WMI commands to the
firmware. Upon receiving a copy complete interrupt, host driver will
immediately unmap and frees the buffer presuming that hardware has
processed the buffer. In the issue case, upon receiving copy complete
interrupt, host driver will unmap and free the buffer but since hardware
is still accessing the buffer (which in this case got unmapped in
parallel), SMMU hardware will trigger an SMMU fault resulting in a
kernel panic.

In order to avoid this, as a work around, add a delay before unmapping
the copy engine source DMA buffer. This is conditionally done for
WCN3990 and only for the CE3 channel where issue is seen.

Below is the crash signature:

wifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix slab-out-of-bounds access in sdio host

SDIO may need addtional 511 bytes to align bus operation. If the tailroom
of this skb is not big enough, we would access invalid memory region.
For low level operation, increase skb size to keep valid memory access in
SDIO host.

Inject fault while probing module, if device_register() fails in

not decreased to 0, the name allocated in dev_set_name() is leaked.
Fix this by calling put_device(), so that name can be freed in

There are two refcount leak bugs in qcom_smsm_probe():

(1) The 'local_node' is escaped out from for_each_child_of_node() as
the break of iteration, we should call of_node_put() for it in error
path or when it is not used anymore.
(2) The 'node' is escaped out from for_each_available_child_of_node()
as the 'goto', we should call of_node_put() for it in goto target.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50704 | USB: gadget: Fix use-after-free during usb config switch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50704</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: gadget: Fix use-after-free during usb config switch

In the process of switching USB config from rndis to other config,
if the hardware does not support the -&gt;pullup callback, or the
hardware encounters a low probability fault, both of them may cause
the -&gt;pullup callback to fail, which will then cause a system panic
(use after free).

The gadget drivers sometimes need to be unloaded regardless of the
hardware's behavior.

net/ieee802154: don't warn zero-sized raw_sendmsg()

syzbot is hitting skb_assert_len() warning at __dev_queue_xmit() [1],
for PF_IEEE802154 socket's zero-sized raw_sendmsg() request is hitting
__dev_queue_xmit() with skb-&gt;len == 0.

Since PF_IEEE802154 socket's zero-sized raw_sendmsg() request was
able to return 0, don't call __dev_queue_xmit() if packet length is 0.

  ----------
  #include socket.h&gt;
  #include in.h&gt;

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    struct sockaddr_in addr = { .sin_family = AF_INET, .sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_LOOPBACK) };

    sendmsg(socket(PF_IEEE802154, SOCK_RAW, 0), &amp;amp;hdr, 0);
    return 0;
  }
  ----------

Note that this might be a sign that commit fd1894224407c484 ("bpf: Don't

wifi: ath9k: avoid uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()

syzbot is reporting uninit value at ath9k_htc_rx_msg() [1], for
ioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_WRITE) can call ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() with
pkt_len = 0 but ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() uses
__dev_alloc_skb(pkt_len + 32, GFP_ATOMIC) based on an assumption that
pkt_len is valid. As a result, ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() allocates skb
with uninitialized memory and ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is reading from
uninitialized memory.

Since bytes accessed by ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is not known until
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is called, it would be difficult to check minimal valid
pkt_len at "if (pkt_len &gt; 2 * MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE) {" line in
ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

We have two choices. One is to workaround by adding __GFP_ZERO so that
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() sees 0 if pkt_len is invalid. The other is to let
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() validate pkt_len before accessing. This patch chose
the latter.

Note that I'm not sure threshold condition is correct, for I can't find
details on possible packet length used by this protocol.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50710 | ice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50710</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: mm: fix VA-range sanity check

Both create_mapping_noalloc() and update_mapping_prot() sanity-check
their 'virt' parameter, but the check itself doesn't make much sense.
The condition used today appears to be a historical accident.

The sanity-check condition:

	if ((virt &gt;= PAGE_END) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

... can only be true for the KASAN shadow region or the module region,
and there's no reason to exclude these specifically for creating and
updateing mappings.

When arm64 support was first upstreamed in commit:

  c1cc1552616d0f35 ("arm64: MMU initialisation")

... the condition was:

	if (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

At the time, VMALLOC_START was the lowest kernel address, and this was
checking whether 'virt' would be translated via TTBR1.

Subsequently in commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... the condition was changed to:

	if ((virt &gt;= VA_START) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

This appear to have been a thinko. The commit moved the linear map to
the bottom of the kernel address space, with VMALLOC_START being at the
halfway point. The old condition would warn for changes to the linear
map below this, and at the time VA_START was the end of the linear map.

Subsequently we cleaned up the naming of VA_START in commit:

  77ad4ce69321abbe ("arm64: memory: rename VA_START to PAGE_END")

... keeping the erroneous condition as:

	if ((virt &gt;= PAGE_END) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

Correct the condition to check against the start of the TTBR1 address
space, which is currently PAGE_OFFSET. This simplifies the logic, and
more clearly matches the "outside kernel range" message in the warning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53990 | SMB3: Add missing locks to protect deferred close file list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53990</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Disallow unallocated resources to be returned

In the event that the topology requests resources that have not been
created by the system (because they are typically not represented in
dpu_mdss_cfg ^1), the resource(s) in global_state (in this case DSC
blocks, until their allocation/assignment is being sanity-checked in
"drm/msm/dpu: Reject topologies for which no DSC blocks are available")
remain NULL but will still be returned out of
dpu_rm_get_assigned_resources, where the caller expects to get an array
containing num_blks valid pointers (but instead gets these NULLs).

To prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences
typically result in a hard-to-debug platform lockup, num_blks shouldn't
increase past NULL blocks and will print an error and break instead.
After all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of
blocks whereas the actual amount varies per platform.

^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended up moving additions to
_dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.

hwrng: virtio - Fix race on data_avail and actual data

The virtio rng device kicks off a new entropy request whenever the
data available reaches zero.  When a new request occurs at the end
of a read operation, that is, when the result of that request is
only needed by the next reader, then there is a race between the
writing of the new data and the next reader.

This is because there is no synchronisation whatsoever between the
writer and the reader.

Fix this by writing data_avail with smp_store_release and reading
it with smp_load_acquire when we first enter read.  The subsequent
reads are safe because they're either protected by the first load
acquire, or by the completion mechanism.

Also remove the redundant zeroing of data_idx in random_recv_done
(data_idx must already be zero at this point) and data_avail in
request_entropy (ditto).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53999 | net/mlx5e: TC, Fix internal port memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53999</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

not called, the refcnt is never decremented, then int_port is never
freed.

In externel_lb process, the hns3 driver call napi_disable()
first, then the reset happen, then the restore process of the
externel_lb will fail, and will not call napi_enable(). When
doing externel_lb again, napi_disable() will be double call,
cause a deadlock of rtnl_lock().

This patch use the HNS3_NIC_STATE_DOWN state to protect the
calling of napi_disable() and napi_enable() in externel_lb
process, just as the usage in ndo_stop() and ndo_start().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54001 | staging: r8712: Fix memory leak in _r8712_init_xmit_priv()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54001</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix assertion of exclop condition when starting balance

Balance as exclusive state is compatible with paused balance and device
add, which makes some things more complicated. The assertion of valid
states when starting from paused balance needs to take into account two
more states, the combinations can be hit when there are several threads
racing to start balance and device add. This won't typically happen when
the commands are started from command line.

Scenario 1: With exclusive_operation state == BTRFS_EXCLOP_NONE.

Concurrently adding multiple devices to the same mount point and
btrfs_exclop_finish executed finishes before assertion in
btrfs_exclop_balance, exclusive_operation will changed to
BTRFS_EXCLOP_NONE state which lead to assertion failed:

Scenario 2: With exclusive_operation state == BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED.

Concurrently adding multiple devices to the same mount point and
btrfs_exclop_balance executed finish before the latter thread execute
assertion in btrfs_exclop_balance, exclusive_operation will changed to
BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED state which lead to assertion failed:

udplite: Fix NULL pointer dereference in __sk_mem_raise_allocated().

syzbot reported [0] a null-ptr-deref in sk_get_rmem0() while using
IPPROTO_UDPLITE (0x88):

  14:25:52 executing program 1:
  r0 = socket$inet6(0xa, 0x80002, 0x88)

We had a similar report [1] for probably sk_memory_allocated_add()
in __sk_mem_raise_allocated(), and commit c915fe13cbaa ("udplite: fix
NULL pointer dereference") fixed it by setting .memory_allocated for
udplite_prot and udplitev6_prot.

To fix the variant, we need to set either .sysctl_wmem_offset or
.sysctl_rmem.

Now UDP and UDPLITE share the same value for .memory_allocated, so we
use the same .sysctl_wmem_offset for UDP and UDPLITE.

Example thread interleaving that causes the general protection fault
is as follows:

CPU1 (vmci_host_poll)               CPU2 (vmci_host_do_init_context)
-----                               -----
// Read uninitialized context
context = vmci_host_dev-&gt;context;
                                    // Initialize context
                                    vmci_host_dev-&gt;context = vmci_ctx_create();
                                    vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type = VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT;

if (vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type == VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT) {
    // Dereferencing the wrong pointer
    poll_wait(..., &amp;amp;context-&gt;host_context);
}

In this scenario, vmci_host_poll() reads vmci_host_dev-&gt;context first,
and then reads vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type to check that
vmci_host_dev-&gt;context is initialized. However, since these two reads
are not atomically executed, there is a chance of a race condition as
described above.

To fix this race condition, read vmci_host_dev-&gt;context after checking
the value of vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type so that vmci_host_poll() always
reads an initialized context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54008 | virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally

We try to build affinity mask via create_affinity_masks()
unconditionally which may lead several issues:

- the affinity mask is not used for parent without affinity support
  (only VDUSE support the affinity now)
- the logic of create_affinity_masks() might not work for devices
  other than block. For example it's not rare in the networking device
  where the number of queues could exceed the number of CPUs. Such
  case breaks the current affinity logic which is based on
  group_cpus_evenly() who assumes the number of CPUs are not less than
  the number of groups. This can trigger a warning[1]:

	if (ret &gt;= 0)
		WARN_ON(nr_present + nr_others &lt; numgrps);

Fixing this by only build the affinity masks only when

- Driver passes affinity descriptor, driver like virtio-blk can make
  sure to limit the number of queues when it exceeds the number of CPUs
- Parent support affinity setting config ops

This help to avoid the warning. More optimizations could be done on
top.

directly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.

net: fix stack overflow when LRO is disabled for virtual interfaces

When the virtual interface's feature is updated, it synchronizes the
updated feature for its own lower interface.
This propagation logic should be worked as the iteration, not recursively.
But it works recursively due to the netdev notification unexpectedly.
This problem occurs when it disables LRO only for the team and bonding
interface type.

       team0
         |
  +------+------+-----+-----+
  |      |      |     |     |
team1  team2  team3  ...  team200

If team0's LRO feature is updated, it generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE
event to its own lower interfaces(team1 ~ team200).
It is worked by netdev_sync_lower_features().
So, the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE notification logic of each lower interface
work iteratively.
But generated NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event is also sent to the upper
interface too.
upper interface(team0) generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event for its own
lower interfaces again.
lower and upper interfaces receive this event and generate this
event again and again.
So, the stack overflow occurs.

But it is not the infinite loop issue.
Because the netdev_sync_lower_features() updates features before
generating the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event.
Already synchronized lower interfaces skip notification logic.
So, it is just the problem that iteration logic is changed to the
recursive unexpectedly due to the notification mechanism.

Reproducer:

ip link add team0 type team
ethtool -K team0 lro on
for i in {1..200}
do
        ip link add team$i master team0 type team
        ethtool -K team$i lro on
done

ethtool -K team0 lro off

In order to fix it, the notifier_ctx member of bonding/team is introduced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54013 | interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54013</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim

For cases where icc_bw_set() can be called in callbaths that could
deadlock against shrinker/reclaim, such as runpm resume, we need to
decouple the icc locking.  Introduce a new icc_bw_lock for cases where
we need to serialize bw aggregation and update to decouple that from
paths that require memory allocation such as node/link creation/
destruction.

Destroying psi trigger in cgroup_file_release causes UAF issues when

because cgroup removal causes a call to cgroup_file_release while the

  poll_freewait -&gt; UAF access to the trigger's waitqueue head

Patch [1] fixed this issue for epoll() case using wake_up_pollfree(),
however the same issue exists for synchronous poll() case.
The root cause of this issue is that the lifecycles of the psi trigger's
waitqueue and of the file associated with the trigger are different. Fix
this by using kernfs_generic_poll function when polling on cgroup-specific
psi triggers. It internally uses kernfs_open_node-&gt;poll waitqueue head
with its lifecycle tied to the file's lifecycle. This also renders the
fix in [1] obsolete, so revert it.

dmaengine: sf-pdma: pdma_desc memory leak fix

Commit b2cc5c465c2c ("dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a
DMA channel") changed sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy() to unconditionally
allocate a new sf_pdma_desc each time it is called.

The driver previously recycled descs, by checking the in_use flag, only
allocating additional descs if the existing one was in use. This logic
was removed in commit b2cc5c465c2c ("dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread
support for a DMA channel"), but sf_pdma_free_desc() was not changed to
handle the new behaviour.

As a result, each time sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy() is called, the previous
descriptor is leaked, over time leading to memory starvation:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open

The allocation and initialization errors at alloc_midi_urbs() that is
called at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at the
caller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs()
loops only for ep-&gt;num_urbs entries, and since ep-&gt;num_entries wasn't
updated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this
entry won't be released.

The intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so
change the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing
the missed releases.

Also, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at
snd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at
reopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at
the error path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54023 | btrfs: fix race between balance and cancel/pause</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54023</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reproducer is running a balance and a cancel or pause in parallel.
The way balance finishes is a bit wonky, if we were paused we need to
save the balance_ctl in the fs_info, but clear it otherwise and cleanup.
However we rely on the return values being specific errors, or having a
cancel request or no pause request.  If balance completes and returns 0,
but we have a pause or cancel request we won't do the appropriate
cleanup, and then the next time we try to start a balance we'll trip
this ASSERT.

The error handling is just wrong here, we always want to clean up,
unless we got -ECANCELLED and we set the appropriate pause flag in the
exclusive op.  With this patch the reproducer ran for an hour without
tripping, previously it would trip in less than a few minutes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54024 | KVM: Destroy target device if coalesced MMIO unregistration fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54024</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

opp: Fix use-after-free in lazy_opp_tables after probe deferral

When dev_pm_opp_of_find_icc_paths() in _allocate_opp_table() returns
-EPROBE_DEFER, the opp_table is freed again, to wait until all the
interconnect paths are available.

However, if the OPP table is using required-opps then it may already
have been added to the global lazy_opp_tables list. The error path
does not remove the opp_table from the list again.

This can cause crashes later when the provider of the required-opps
is added, since we will iterate over OPP tables that have already been
freed. E.g.:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference when read

iio: core: Prevent invalid memory access when there is no parent

Commit 813665564b3d ("iio: core: Convert to use firmware node handle
instead of OF node") switched the kind of nodes to use for label
retrieval in device registration.  Probably an unwanted change in that
commit was that if the device has no parent then NULL pointer is
accessed.  This is what happens in the stock IIO dummy driver when a
new entry is created in configfs:

  # mkdir /sys/kernel/config/iio/devices/dummy/foo
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: ...
  ...
  Call Trace:
  __iio_device_register
  iio_dummy_probe

Since there seems to be no reason to make a parent device of an IIO
dummy device mandatory, let’s prevent the invalid memory access in
__iio_device_register when the parent device is NULL.  With this
change, the IIO dummy driver works fine with configfs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54028 | RDMA/rxe: Fix the error &amp;quot;trying to register non-static key in rxe_cleanup_task&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix a memory leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps

The LRU and LRU_PERCPU maps allocate a new element on update before locking the
target hash table bucket. Right after that the maps try to lock the bucket.
If this fails, then maps return -EBUSY to the caller without releasing the
allocated element. This makes the element untracked: it doesn't belong to
either of free lists, and it doesn't belong to the hash table, so can't be
re-used; this eventually leads to the permanent -ENOMEM on LRU map updates,
which is unexpected. Fix this by returning the element to the local free list
if bucket locking fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54034 | iommufd: Make sure to zero vfio_iommu_type1_info before copying to user</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54034</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl8xxxu: Fix memory leaks with RTL8723BU, RTL8192EU

The wifi + bluetooth combo chip RTL8723BU can leak memory (especially?)
when it's connected to a bluetooth audio device. The busy bluetooth
traffic generates lots of C2H (card to host) messages, which are not
freed correctly.

To fix this, move the dev_kfree_skb() call in rtl8xxxu_c2hcmd_callback()
inside the loop where skb_dequeue() is called.

The RTL8192EU leaks memory because the C2H messages are added to the
queue and left there forever. (This was fine in the past because it
probably wasn't sending any C2H messages until commit e542e66b7c2e
("wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control"). Since that commit
it sends a C2H message when the TX rate changes.)

To fix this, delete the check for rf_paths &gt; 1 and the goto. Let the
function process the C2H messages from RTL8192EU like the ones from
the other chips.

Theoretically the RTL8188FU could also leak like RTL8723BU, but it
most likely doesn't send C2H messages frequently enough.

This change was tested with RTL8723BU by Erhard F. I tested it with
RTL8188FU and RTL8192EU.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54037 | ice: prevent NULL pointer deref during reload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54037</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: prevent NULL pointer deref during reload

Calling ethtool during reload can lead to call trace, because VSI isn't
configured for some time, but netdev is alive.

To fix it add rtnl lock for VSI deconfig and config. Set ::num_q_vectors
to 0 after freeing and add a check for ::tx/rx_rings in ring related
ethtool ops.

Add proper unroll of filters in ice_start_eth().

Bluetooth: hci_conn: return ERR_PTR instead of NULL when there is no link

hci_connect_sco currently returns NULL when there is no link (i.e. when
hci_conn_link() returns NULL).

sco_connect() expects an ERR_PTR in case of any error (see line 266 in
sco.c). Thus, hcon set as NULL passes through to sco_conn_add(), which
tries to get hcon-&gt;hdev, resulting in dereferencing a NULL pointer as
reported by syzkaller.

The same issue exists for iso_connect_cis() calling hci_connect_cis().

Thus, make hci_connect_sco() and hci_connect_cis() return ERR_PTR
instead of NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54039 | can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54039</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access

In the j1939_tp_tx_dat_new() function, an out-of-bounds memory access
could occur during the memcpy() operation if the size of skb-&gt;cb is
larger than the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This is because the
memcpy() operation uses the size of skb-&gt;cb, leading to a read beyond
the struct j1939_sk_buff_cb.

Updated the memcpy() operation to use the size of struct
j1939_sk_buff_cb instead of the size of skb-&gt;cb. This ensures that the
memcpy() operation only reads the memory within the bounds of struct
j1939_sk_buff_cb, preventing out-of-bounds memory access.

Additionally, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check that the size of skb-&gt;cb
is greater than or equal to the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This
ensures that the skb-&gt;cb buffer is large enough to hold the
j1939_sk_buff_cb structure.

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans-&gt;len + 1)',

When copying data from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
as the length is incorrect because:

1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' (which has size
   'trans-&gt;len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf' if 'len' is
   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1
   overflows the buffer.

gfs2: Prevent recursive memory reclaim

Function new_inode() returns a new inode with inode-&gt;i_mapping-&gt;gfp_mask
set to GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.  This value includes the __GFP_FS flag, so
allocations in that address space can recurse into filesystem memory
reclaim.  We don't want that to happen because it can consume a
significant amount of stack memory.

Worse than that is that it can also deadlock: for example, in several
places, gfs2_unstuff_dinode() is called inside filesystem transactions.
This calls filemap_grab_folio(), which can allocate a new folio, which
can trigger memory reclaim.  If memory reclaim recurses into the
filesystem and starts another transaction, a deadlock will ensue.

To fix these kinds of problems, prevent memory reclaim from recursing
into filesystem code by making sure that the gfp_mask of inode address
spaces doesn't include __GFP_FS.

The "meta" and resource group address spaces were already using GFP_NOFS
as their gfp_mask (which doesn't include __GFP_FS).  The default value
of GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is less restrictive than GFP_NOFS, though.  To
avoid being overly limiting, use the default value and only knock off
the __GFP_FS flag.  I'm not sure if this will actually make a
difference, but it also shouldn't hurt.

This patch is loosely based on commit ad22c7a043c2 ("xfs: prevent stack
overflows from page cache allocation").

Fixes xfstest generic/273.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68357 | iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68357</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix racy bitfield write in btrfs_clear_space_info_full()

From the memory-barriers.txt document regarding memory barrier ordering
guarantees:

 (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often
     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write
     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel
     algorithms.

 (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields
     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields
     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's
     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one
     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.

btrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of
the fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush:

struct btrfs_space_info {
        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info;              /*     0     8 */
        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent;               /*     8     8 */
        ...
        int                        clamp;                /*   172     4 */
        unsigned int               full:1;               /*   176: 0  4 */
        unsigned int               chunk_alloc:1;        /*   176: 1  4 */
        unsigned int               flush:1;              /*   176: 2  4 */
        ...

Therefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to
one of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the
bitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and
writes out found-&gt;full = 0 without a lock.

Imagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we
finished deleting a block_group and are thus calling
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim
ticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space():

          T1                                             T2
btrfs_commit_transaction
  btrfs_clear_space_info_full
  data_sinfo-&gt;full = 0
  READ: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)
                                              spin_lock(&amp;amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                              if(list_empty(tickets))
                                                space_info-&gt;flush = 0;
                                                READ: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                                MOD/WRITE: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:0
                                                spin_unlock(&amp;amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                                return;
  MOD/WRITE: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1

and now data_sinfo-&gt;flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This
breaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or
running. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go
into __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info-&gt;tickets but will
see space_info-&gt;flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,
they will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible
to kick the worker again.

I also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that
it is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,
the assembly is:
  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)
and similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0:
  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)

So I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed
a number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to
reproduce it.

Rather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take
advantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that
it is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to
bools. This avoids writes to space_info-&gt;full having any effect on

btrfs: fix double free of qgroup record after failure to add delayed ref head

In the previous code it was possible to incur into a double kfree()
scenario when calling add_delayed_ref_head(). This could happen if the
record was reported to already exist in the
btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error
later on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since
add_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the
record. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer
to NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object
which was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.

The problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the
object is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the
fix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of
the add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()
the given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to
act on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the
'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the
tracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'
boolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object
only if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the
tracing logic.

As a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that
'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the
function, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert
happens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid
value on an early exit.

The documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated
to reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68360 | wifi: mt76: wed: use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68360</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal

Correct possible race conditions during device removal.

Previously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute
after the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other
resource access issues.

This race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN
reset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to
use-after-free and improper access to freed resources.

  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in
    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset
    is skipped.

  - Cancel any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().

  - Ensure device freeing in sdev_destroy() is done while holding the
    LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68372 | nbd: defer config put in recv_work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68372</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: defer config put in recv_work

There is one uaf issue in recv_work when running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK and
NBD_CMD_RECONFIGURE:
  nbd_genl_connect     // conf_ref=2 (connect and recv_work A)
  nbd_open	       // conf_ref=3
  recv_work A done     // conf_ref=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK       // conf_ref=1
  nbd_genl_reconfigure // conf_ref=2 (trigger recv_work B)
  close nbd	       // conf_ref=1
  recv_work B
    config_put         // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&amp;amp;config-&gt;recv_threads); -&gt; UAF

Or only running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK:
  nbd_genl_connect   // conf_ref=2
  nbd_open 	     // conf_ref=3
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK     // conf_ref=2
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      config_put     // conf_ref=1
  recv_work
    config_put 	     // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&amp;amp;config-&gt;recv_threads); -&gt; UAF

Commit 87aac3a80af5 ("nbd: call nbd_config_put() before notifying the
waiter") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in
recv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not
be woken up while nbd-&gt;task_recv was still uncleared.

However, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly
calls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.
Therefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.

Move nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is
held for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the
config cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear
+ reconfigure interleave.

In addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last
nbd_put (which causes deadlock):

path A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_disconnect_and_put
        flush_workqueue // recv_work done
      nbd_config_put
        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0
        queue_work

path B (netlink without NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=2 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=3
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK // conf_refs=2
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_config_put // conf_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=2
  recv_work done // conf_refs=0, nbd_refs=1
  rmmod // nbd_refs=0

There is a uaf problem which is found by case 23rdev-lifetime:

The sequence is:
1. rdev remove path gets reconfig_mutex
2. rdev remove path release reconfig_mutex in mddev_unlock
3. md stop calls do_md_stop and sets MD_DELETED
4. rdev remove path calls del_gendisk because MD_DELETED is set
5. md stop path release reconfig_mutex and calls del_gendisk again

So there is a race condition we should resolve. This patch adds a
flag MD_DO_DELETE to avoid the race condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68374 | md: fix rcu protection in md_wakeup_thread</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68374</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86: Fix NULL event access and potential PEBS record loss

When intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() is called to drain PEBS records, the
perf_event_overflow() could be called to process the last PEBS record.

While perf_event_overflow() could trigger the interrupt throttle and
stop all events of the group, like what the below call-chain shows.

perf_event_overflow()
  -&gt; __perf_event_overflow()
    -&gt;__perf_event_account_interrupt()
      -&gt; perf_event_throttle_group()
        -&gt; perf_event_throttle()
          -&gt; event-&gt;pmu-&gt;stop()
            -&gt; x86_pmu_stop()

The side effect of stopping the events is that all corresponding event
pointers in cpuc-&gt;events[] array are cleared to NULL.

Assume there are two PEBS events (event a and event b) in a group. When
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() calls perf_event_overflow() to process the
last PEBS record of PEBS event a, interrupt throttle is triggered and
all pointers of event a and event b are cleared to NULL. Then
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() tries to process the last PEBS record of
event b and encounters NULL pointer access.

To avoid this issue, move cpuc-&gt;events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop()
to x86_pmu_del(). It's safe since cpuc-&gt;active_mask or
cpuc-&gt;pebs_enabled is always checked before access the event pointer
from cpuc-&gt;events[].</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68376 | coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68376</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue

When ETR is enabled as CS_MODE_SYSFS, if the buffer size is changed

etr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed to buf_old, not
updated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory
use-after-free issue.

Fix this by checking ETR's mode before updating and releasing buf_old,
if the mode is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68377 | ns: initialize ns_list_node for initial namespaces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68377</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Swap the assignment to fix this issue.

As the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it
needs to go via he_mcs-&gt;rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping
done, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.

Use check_add_overflow() to guard against potential integer overflows
when adding the binary blob lengths and the size of an asymmetric_key_id
structure and return ERR_PTR(-EOVERFLOW) accordingly. This prevents a
possible buffer overflow when copying data from potentially malicious
X.509 certificate fields that can be arbitrarily large, such as ASN.1

bpf: Do not let BPF test infra emit invalid GSO types to stack

Yinhao et al. reported that their fuzzer tool was able to trigger a
skb_warn_bad_offload() from netif_skb_features() -&gt; gso_features_check().
When a BPF program - triggered via BPF test infra - pushes the packet
to the loopback device via bpf_clone_redirect() then mentioned offload
warning can be seen. GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.

We get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting
gso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense
that this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due
to the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy
through setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific
assumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further
into the GSO engine in the first place.

The checks were added in 121d57af308d ("gso: validate gso_type in GSO
handlers") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine
a protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such
packets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via
netif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs
could be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be
an additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given
bpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit
such packets, lets reject them right there.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:44:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68726 | crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68726</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling

Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg")
introduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type
specific reqsize fields. It looks like this was introduced specifically
for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent commits
add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.

However, this is being recommended for use in all crypto algs
instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
cra_reqsize in aead algorithms, hence, causes memory corruptions and
crashes as the underlying functions in the algorithm framework have not
been updated to set the reqsize properly from cra_reqsize. [1]

Add proper set_reqsize calls in the aead init function to properly
initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.

ntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be

uptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a
buffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record

wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path

Currently, packets received on the REO exception ring from
unassociated peers are of MSDU buffer type, while the driver expects
link descriptor type packets. These packets are not parsed further due
to a return check on packet type in ath12k_hal_desc_reo_parse_err(),
but the associated skb is not freed. This may lead to kernel
crashes and buffer leaks.

Hence to fix, update the RX error handler to explicitly drop
MSDU buffer type packets received on the REO exception ring.
This prevents further processing of invalid packets and ensures
stability in the RX error handling path.

atm/fore200e: Fix possible data race in fore200e_open()

Protect access to fore200e-&gt;available_cell_rate with rate_mtx lock in the
error handling path of fore200e_open() to prevent a data race.

The field fore200e-&gt;available_cell_rate is a shared resource used to track
available bandwidth. It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(),
fore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().

In fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting
vcc-&gt;qos.txtp.max_pcr from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth.
However, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin() fails, the
function restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to
available_cell_rate without holding the lock.

This introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is a global
device resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in
fore200e_open() executes concurrently with operations like
fore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs, a
read-modify-write race occurs.

Specifically, the error path reads the rate without the lock. If another
CPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in
fore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error
path will overwrite the concurrent update with a stale value. This results
in incorrect bandwidth accounting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68340 | team: Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68340</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

team: Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add

Attempting to add a port device that is already up will expectedly fail,
but not before modifying the team device header_ops.

In the case of the syzbot reproducer the gre0 device is
already in state UP when it attempts to add it as a
port device of team0, this fails but before that
header_ops-&gt;create of team0 is changed from eth_header to ipgre_header
in the call to team_dev_type_check_change.

Later when we end up in ipgre_header() struct ip_tunnel* points to nonsense
as the private data of the device still holds a struct team.

Example sequence of iproute2 commands to reproduce the hang/BUG():
ip link add dev team0 type team
ip link add dev gre0 type gre
ip link set dev gre0 up
ip link set dev gre0 master team0
ip link set dev team0 up
ping -I team0 1.1.1.1

Move team_dev_type_check_change down where all other checks have passed
as it changes the dev type with no way to restore it in case
one of the checks that follow it fail.

Also make sure to preserve the origial mtu assignment:
  - If port_dev is not the same type as dev, dev takes mtu from port_dev
  - If port_dev is the same type as dev, port_dev takes mtu from dev

This is done by adding a conditional before the call to dev_set_mtu
to prevent it from assigning port_dev-&gt;mtu = dev-&gt;mtu and instead
letting team_dev_type_check_change assign dev-&gt;mtu = port_dev-&gt;mtu.
The conditional is needed because the patch moves the call to
team_dev_type_check_change past dev_set_mtu.

Testing:
  - team device driver in-tree selftests
  - Add/remove various devices as slaves of team device

veth: reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race

As explain in commit fa349e396e48 ("veth: Fix race with AF_XDP exposing
old or uninitialized descriptors") for veth there is a chance after
napi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI
instance running veth_pool(). For NAPI this is correctly handled as the
napi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting
scheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run
concurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.

The problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't
designed to be nested.

Prior to commit 401cb7dae813 ("net: Reference bpf_redirect_info via
task_struct on PREEMPT_RT.") the temporary BPF net context
bpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since
this commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When
running veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage
area. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls
one exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net
context.

Race is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()
section before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function
xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct().</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68342 | can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68342</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data

The URB received in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct
gs_host_frame. The length of the data after the header depends on the
gs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time
stamping).

Introduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have
at least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only
copy the data to that skb that has actually been received.

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header

The driver expects to receive a struct gs_host_frame in
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().

Use struct_group to describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and
check that we have at least received the header before accessing any
members of it.

To resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer chain
"dev-&gt;parent-&gt;hf_size_rx" but use "parent-&gt;hf_size_rx" instead. Since
"urb-&gt;context" contains "parent", it is always defined, while "dev" is not
defined if the URB it too short.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:01:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66845 | A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in TechStore version 1.0.

Prior to versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3, an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp Vault authentication. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient path validation when loading the Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount. An attacker with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can exfiltrate the content of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod resides) by directing the file's content to a server under their control, as part of the Vault authentication request. The potential impact includes the exfiltration of sensitive system information, such as secrets, keys, or the content of files like /etc/passwd. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:48:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34457 | wb2osz/direwolf &amp;lt;= 1.8 Stack-based Buffer Overflow DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34457</link><description>wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 694c954, contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kiss_rec_byte() located in src/kiss_frame.c.

The issue occurs because usbhs_sys_function_pullup(), which accesses the IP
registers, is executed after the USBHS clocks have been disabled. The
problem is reproducible on the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC starting with the
addition of module stop in the clock enable/disable APIs. With module stop
functionality enabled, a bus error is expected if a master accesses a
module whose clock has been stopped and module stop activated.

Disable the IP clocks at the end of remove.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68328 | firmware: stratix10-svc: fix bug in saving controller data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68328</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel
calls vm_ops-&gt;close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this
results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent
VMA splits entirely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68330 | iio: accel: bmc150: Fix irq assumption regression</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68330</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg-&gt;dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo-&gt;cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo-&gt;resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68332 | comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68332</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

a power hang.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68335 | comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68335</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev-&gt;read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
&amp;amp;struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
&amp;amp;s-&gt;async-&gt;cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own -&gt;cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

[1] Syzbot crash:

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:30:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10021 | A Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability exists in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK static versions (mt) before 2026.12.
