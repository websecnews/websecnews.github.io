usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access

If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't
calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification
instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can
lead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between
fragments, causing `expected_size - acm-&gt;nb_index` to wrap.

This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,
it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1
("cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications").

A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace
has opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will
do that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and
its other interfaces.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 09:48:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1553 | pankajindevops scale project cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1553</link><description>A vulnerability was found in pankajindevops scale up to 3633544a00245d3df88b6d13d9b3dd0f411be7f6.
