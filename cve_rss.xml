fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount

The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level
module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region
during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.

To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region
struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for
registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and
rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper
macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the
owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules
and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.

Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface
for registering an fpga region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 14:18:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36479 | fpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36479</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Only use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue

The GuC context scheduling queue is 2 entires deep, thus it is possible
for a migration job to be stuck behind a fault if migration exec queue
shares engines with user jobs. This can deadlock as the migrate exec
queue is required to service page faults. Avoid deadlock by only using
reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue.

riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads

Top of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However
this is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts.
Their stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.

Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28
("riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early").
However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem
has been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function
smp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs
structure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save
or restore inexistent V context.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 14:18:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39291 | drm/amdgpu: Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() and rlc_microcode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39291</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() and rlc_microcode()

The function gfx_v9_4_3_init_microcode in gfx_v9_4_3.c was generating
about potential truncation of output when using the snprintf function.
The issue was due to the size of the buffer 'ucode_prefix' being too
small to accommodate the maximum possible length of the string being
written into it.

The string being written is "amdgpu/%s_mec.bin" or "amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin",
where %s is replaced by the value of 'chip_name'. The length of this
string without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated
that 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total
of 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.

To resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has been
reduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length of
the string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thus
preventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues.

Fixes the below with gcc W=1:

um: Add winch to winch_handlers before registering winch IRQ

Registering a winch IRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch is
added to the winch_handlers list.

If that happens, register_winch_irq() adds to that list a winch that is
scheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing a panic later in
winch_cleanup().

Avoid the race by adding the winch to the winch_handlers list before
registering the IRQ, and rolling back if um_request_irq() fails.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 14:18:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4748 | RCE in Cruddiy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4748</link><description>The CRUDDIY project is vulnerable to shell command injection via sending a crafted POST request to the application server.

We must always register the DRM bridge, since zynqmp_dp_hpd_work_func

drm_bridge_attach. This fixes the following lockdep warning:

When a low-privileged user adds a component through the API endpoint `api/v1/workspaces/default/components` with a name containing a `\n` character, it leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. This vulnerability results in the inability of users to add new components in certain categories (e.g., 'Image Builder') and to register new stacks through the UI, thereby degrading the user experience and potentially rendering the ZenML Dashboard unusable. The issue does not affect component addition through the Web UI, as `\n` characters are properly escaped in that context. The vulnerability was tested on ZenML running in Docker, and it was observed in both Firefox and Chrome browsers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 07:10:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4899 | SEOPress &amp;lt; 7.8 - Contributor+ Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4899</link><description>The SEOPress  WordPress plugin before 7.8 does not sanitise and escape some of its Post settings, which could allow high privilege users such as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 06:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4900 | SEOPress &amp;lt; 7.8 - Contributor+ Open Redirect</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4900</link><description>The SEOPress  WordPress plugin before 7.8 does not validate and escape one of its Post settings, which could allow contributor and above role to perform Open redirect attacks against any user viewing a malicious post</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 06:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4499 | CSRF Vulnerability in parisneo/lollms XTTS Server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4499</link><description>A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the XTTS server of parisneo/lollms version 9.6 due to a lax CORS policy.

The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`""`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 16:26:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6253 | itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System purchase.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6253</link><description>A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System 1.0 and classified as critical.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:37:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21514 | This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 0.0.0.
