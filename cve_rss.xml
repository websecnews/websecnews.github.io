Prior to version 20.36.1, TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in virtualenv allow local attackers to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations. This issue has been patched in version 20.36.1.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:15:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22703 | Cosign verification accepts any valid Rekor entry under certain conditions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22703</link><description>Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4, Cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify an artifact even if the embedded Rekor entry does not reference the artifact's digest, signature or public key. When verifying a Rekor entry, Cosign verifies the Rekor entry signature, and also compares the artifact's digest, the user's public key from either a Fulcio certificate or provided by the user, and the artifact signature to the Rekor entry contents. Without these comparisons, Cosign would accept any response from Rekor as valid. A malicious actor that has compromised a user's identity or signing key could construct a valid Cosign bundle by including any arbitrary Rekor entry, thus preventing the user from being able to audit the signing event. This issue has been patched in versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:15:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22705 | RustCrypto: Signatures has timing side-channel in ML-DSA decomposition</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22705</link><description>RustCrypto: Signatures offers support for digital signatures, which provide authentication of data using public-key cryptography. Prior to version 0.1.0-rc.2, a timing side-channel was discovered in the Decompose algorithm which is used during ML-DSA signing to generate hints for the signature.

Prior to version 3.20.3, a TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the SoftFileLock implementation of the filelock package. An attacker with local filesystem access and permission to create symlinks can exploit a race condition between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock operations to fail or behave unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs in the _acquire() method between raise_on_not_writable_file() (permission check) and os.open() (file creation). During this race window, an attacker can create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the lock to operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 3.20.3.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:15:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22693 | Null Pointer Dereference in SubtableUnicodesCache::create leading to DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22693</link><description>HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. Prior to version 12.3.0, a null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the SubtableUnicodesCache::create function located in src/hb-ot-cmap-table.hh. The function fails to check if hb_malloc returns NULL before using placement new to construct an object at the returned pointer address. When hb_malloc fails to allocate memory (which can occur in low-memory conditions or when using custom allocators that simulate allocation failures), it returns NULL. The code then attempts to call the constructor on this null pointer using placement new syntax, resulting in undefined behavior and a Segmentation Fault. This issue has been patched in version 12.3.0.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:15:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22685 | DevToys Path Traversal (“Zip Slip”) Vulnerability in DevToys Extension Installation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22685</link><description>DevToys is a desktop app for developers. In versions from 2.0.0.0 to before 2.0.9.0, a path traversal vulnerability exists in the DevToys extension installation mechanism. When processing extension packages (NUPKG archives), DevToys does not sufficiently validate file paths contained within the archive. A malicious extension package could include crafted file entries such as ../../…/target-file, causing the extraction process to write files outside the intended extensions directory. This flaw enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the user’s system with the privileges of the DevToys process. Depending on the environment, this may lead to code execution, configuration tampering, or corruption of application or system files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.9.0.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:53:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22689 | Mailpit is vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) allowing unauthenticated access to emails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22689</link><description>Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Prior to version 1.28.2, the Mailpit WebSocket server is configured to accept connections from any origin. This lack of Origin header validation introduces a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability. An attacker can host a malicious website that, when visited by a developer running Mailpit locally, establishes a WebSocket connection to the victim's Mailpit instance (default ws://localhost:8025). This allows the attacker to intercept sensitive data such as email contents, headers, and server statistics in real-time. This issue has been patched in version 1.28.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:53:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22611 | AWS SDK for .NET V4 adopted defense in depth enhancement for region parameter value</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22611</link><description>AWS SDK for .NET works with Amazon Web Services to help build scalable solutions with Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, and more. From versions 4.0.0 to before 4.0.3.3, Customer applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. This notification is related to the use of specific values for the region input field when calling AWS services. An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.3.3.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:53:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22698 | RustCrypto SM2-PKE has 32-bit Biased Nonce Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22698</link><description>RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22699 | RustCrypto SM2-PKE has Unchecked AffinePoint Decoding (unwrap) in decrypt()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22699</link><description>RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path where an invalid elliptic-curve point (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is unwrapped without checking. Specifically, AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&amp;amp;encoded_c1) may return a None/CtOption::None when the supplied coordinates are syntactically valid but do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used .unwrap(), causing a panic when presented with such input. This issue has been patched via commit 085b7be.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:24:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22700 | RustCrypto Has Insufficient Length Validation in decrypt() in SM2-PKE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22700</link><description>RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 public-key encryption (PKE) implementation: the decrypt() path performs unchecked slice::split_at operations on input buffers derived from untrusted ciphertext. An attacker can submit short/undersized ciphertext or carefully-crafted DER-encoded structures to trigger bounds-check panics (Rust unwinding) which crash the calling thread or process.

A Local File Read (LFR) vulnerability exists in the work package PDF export functionality of OpenProject prior to version 16.6.4. By uploading a specially crafted SVG file (disguised as a PNG) as a work package attachment, an attacker can exploit the backend image processing engine (ImageMagick). When the work package is exported to PDF, the backend attempts to resize the image, triggering the ImageMagick text: coder. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files that the application user has permissions to access (e.g., /etc/passwd, all project configuration files, private project data, etc.). The attack requires permissions to upload attachments to a container that can be exported to PDF, such as a work package. The issue has been patched in version 16.6.4.

Prior to version 16.6.2, a low‑privileged logged-in user can view the full names of other users. Since user IDs are assigned sequentially and predictably (e.g., 1 to 1000), an attacker can extract a complete list of all users’ full names by iterating through these URLs. The same behavior can also be reproduced via the OpenProject API, allowing automated retrieval of full names through the API as well. This issue has been patched in version 16.6.2.

Prior to version 16.6.2, OpenProject’s unauthenticated password-change endpoint (/account/change_password) was not protected by the same brute-force safeguards that apply to the normal login form. In affected versions, an attacker who can guess or enumerate user IDs can send unlimited password-change requests for a given account without triggering lockout or other rate-limiting controls. This allows automated password-guessing (e.g., with wordlists of common passwords) against valid accounts. Successful guessing results in full account compromise for the targeted user and, depending on that user’s role, can lead to further privilege escalation inside the application. This issue has been patched in version 16.6.2.

On October 1, 2025, Palantir discovered that images uploaded through the Dossier front-end app were not being marked correctly with the proper security levels. The regression was traced back to a change in May 2025, which was meant to allow file uploads to be shared among different artifacts (e.g. other dossiers and presentations).

On deployments configured with CBAC, the front-end would present a security picker dialog to set the security level on the uploads, thereby mitigating the issue.

On deployments without a CBAC configuration, no security picker dialog appears, leading to a security level of CUSTOM with no markings or datasets selected. The resulting markings and groups for the file uploads thus will be only those added by the “Default authorization rules” defined in the Auth Chooser configuration. On most environments, it is expected that the “Default authorization rules" only add the Everyone group.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:35:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0830 | Command Injection in Kiro GitLab Merge Request Helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0830</link><description>Processing specially crafted workspace folder names could allow for arbitrary command injection in the Kiro GitLab Merge-Request helper in Kiro IDE before version 0.6.18 when opening maliciously crafted workspaces.

This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.

This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15464 | KL-001-2026-01: yintibao Fun Print Mobile Unauthorized Access via Context Hijacking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15464</link><description>Exported Activity allows external applications to gain application context and directly launch Gmail with inbox access, bypassing security controls.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68718 | KAYSUS KS-WR1200 routers with firmware 107 expose SSH and TELNET services on the LAN interface with hardcoded root credentials (root:1234567...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68718</link><description>KAYSUS KS-WR1200 routers with firmware 107 expose SSH and TELNET services on the LAN interface with hardcoded root credentials (root:12345678).

Prior to versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5, an Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified that allows an authenticated user to retrieve other users’ address information by modifying an existing order. By editing an order they legitimately own and manipulating address identifiers in the request, the backend server accepts and processes references to addresses belonging to other users, subsequently associating those addresses with the attacker’s order and returning them in the response. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68719 | KAYSUS KS-WR3600 routers with firmware 1.0.5.9.1 mishandle configuration management.

By nature, Mastodon performs a lot of outbound requests to user-provided domains. Mastodon, however, has some protection mechanism to disallow requests to local IP addresses (unless specified in `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES`) to avoid the "confused deputy" problem. The list of disallowed IP address ranges was lacking some IP address ranges that can be used to reach local IP addresses. An attacker can use an IP address in the affected ranges to make Mastodon perform HTTP requests against loopback or local network hosts, potentially allowing access to otherwise private resources and services.

Prior to version 11.14.0, an open redirect vulnerability exists in the Directus SAML authentication callback endpoint. During SAML authentication, the `RelayState` parameter is intended to preserve the user's original destination. However, while the login initiation flow validates redirect targets against allowed domains, this validation is not applied to the callback endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious authentication request that redirects users to an arbitrary external URL upon completion. The vulnerability is present in both the success and error handling paths of the callback. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication. Version 11.14.0 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:46:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22028 | Preact has JSON VNode Injection issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22028</link><description>Preact, a lightweight web development framework, JSON serialization protection to prevent Virtual DOM elements from being constructed from arbitrary JSON. A regression introduced in Preact 10.26.5 caused this protection to be softened. In applications where values from JSON payloads are assumed to be strings and passed unmodified to Preact as children, a specially-crafted JSON payload could be constructed that would be incorrectly treated as a valid VNode. When this chain of failures occurs it can result in HTML injection, which can allow arbitrary script execution if not mitigated by CSP or other means. Applications using affected Preact versions are vulnerable if they meet all of the following conditions: first, pass unmodified, unsanitized values from user-modifiable data sources (APIs, databases, local storage, etc.) directly into the render tree; second assume these values are strings but the data source could return actual JavaScript objects instead of JSON strings; and third, the data source either fails to perform type sanitization AND blindly stores/returns raw objects interchangeably with strings, OR is compromised (e.g., poisoned local storage, filesystem, or database). Versions 10.26.10, 10.27.3, and 10.28.2 patch the issue. The patch versions restore the previous strict equality checks that prevent JSON-parsed objects from being treated as valid VNodes. Other mitigations are available for those who cannot immediately upgrade. Validate input types, cast or validate network data, sanitize external data, and use Content Security Policy (CSP).</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:46:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21892 | Parsl Monitoring Visualization Vulnerable to SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21892</link><description>Parsl is a Python parallel scripting library.

Prior to versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8, the current rule 922110 has a bug when processing multipart requests with multiple parts. When the first rule in a chain iterates over a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last captured value is available to the chained rule, which means malicious charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later part has a legitimate charset. Versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21885 | Miniflux Media Proxy SSRF via /proxy endpoint allows access to internal network resources</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21885</link><description>Miniflux 2 is an open source feed reader. Prior to version 2.2.16, Miniflux's media proxy endpoint (`GET /proxy/{encodedDigest}/{encodedURL}`) can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An authenticated user can cause Miniflux to generate a signed proxy URL for attacker-chosen media URLs embedded in feed entry content, including internal addresses (e.g., localhost, private RFC1918 ranges, or link-local metadata endpoints). Requesting the resulting `/proxy/...` URL makes Miniflux fetch and return the internal response.

In versions from 0.150.0 to before 2.2.2, an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events. The Stripe Trigger creates and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret when registering the webhook endpoint, but incoming webhook requests were not verified against this secret. As a result, any HTTP client that knows the webhook URL could send a POST request containing a matching event type, causing the workflow to execute as if a legitimate Stripe event had been received. This issue affects n8n users who have active workflows using the Stripe Trigger node. An attacker could potentially fake payment or subscription events and influence downstream workflow behavior. The practical risk is reduced by the fact that the webhook URL contains a high-entropy UUID; however, authenticated n8n users with access to the workflow can view this webhook ID. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.2. A temporary workaround for this issue involves users deactivating affected workflows or restricting access to workflows containing Stripe Trigger nodes to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:18:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22242 | CoreShop Vulnerable to SQL Injection via Admin Reports</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22242</link><description>CoreShop is a Pimcore enhanced eCommerce solution.

In versions 3.8.1 and below, if a server is configured with an allowlist (e.g., dashboard.corp), an attacker can register a domain like dashboard.corp.attacker.com (or use a subdomain if applicable) and lure a victim to visit it. The malicious site can then initiate a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable Bokeh server. Since the Origin header (e.g., http://dashboard.corp.attacker.com/) matches the allowlist according to the flawed logic, the connection is accepted. Once connected, the attacker can interact with the Bokeh server on behalf of the victim, potentially accessing sensitive data, or modifying visualizations. This issue is fixed in version 3.8.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:56:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21877 | n8n is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Arbitrary File Write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21877</link><description>n8n is an open source workflow automation platform.

Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]). The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username containing regex meta-characters (e.g., deeply nested groups or quantifiers), causing the MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in the URL path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22035 | Greenshot Vulnerable to OS Command Injection via ExternalCommand Plugin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22035</link><description>Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility.
