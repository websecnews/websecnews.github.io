A Level 1 staff member can modify the supervision relationship of a third party (the target user), who can then view the tickets of the added 'supervised' users. This breaks the authorization model and filters the content of other users' tickets.This issue affects OpenSupports: 4.11.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:48:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10692 | OpenSupports 4.11.0 — SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10692</link><description>The endpoint POST /api/staff/get-new-tickets concatenates the user-controlled parameter departmentId directly into the SQL WHERE clause without parameter binding. As a result, an authenticated staff user (level ≥ 1) can inject SQL to alter the filter logic, effectively bypassing department scoping and disclosing tickets beyond their intended access.This issue affects OpenSupports: 4.11.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59944 | Cursor IDE: Sensitive File Overwrite Bypass is Possible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59944</link><description>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6.23 and below contain case-sensitive checks in the way Cursor IDE protects its sensitive files (e.g., */.cursor/mcp.json), which allows attackers to modify the content of these files through prompt injection and achieve remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive files on case-insensitive fileystems. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:39:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59943 | phpMyFAQ duplicate email registration allows multiple accounts with the same email</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59943</link><description>phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Versions 4.0-nightly-2025-10-03 and below do not enforce uniqueness of email addresses during user registration. This allows multiple distinct accounts to be created with the same email. Because email is often used as an identifier for password resets, notifications, and administrative actions, this flaw can cause account ambiguity and, in certain configurations, may lead to privilege escalation or account takeover. This issue is fixed in version 4.0.13.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:26:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54374 | Eidos: One-click Remote Code Execution through Custom URL Handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54374</link><description>Eidos is an extensible framework for Personal Data Management. Versions 0.21.0 and below contain a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted eidos: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (eidos:), causing the Eidos application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This issue does not have a fix as of October 3, 2025</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59829 | Claude Code: Permission deny bypass is possible through symlink</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59829</link><description>Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Versions below 1.0.120 failed to account for symlinks when checking permission deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file and Claude Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code to access the file. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.120.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 20:26:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53354 | NiceGUI is vulnerable to Reflected XSS attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53354</link><description>NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. Versions 2.24.2 and below are at risk for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when developers render unescaped user input into the DOM using ui.html(). NiceGUI did not enforce HTML or JavaScript sanitization, so applications that directly combine components like ui.input() with ui.html() or  ui.chat_message with HTML content without escaping may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s browser. Applications that do not pass untrusted input into ui.html() are not affected. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 19:42:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49844 | Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49844</link><description>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.

In versions 1.7 and below, a vulnerability in the way Cursor CLI Agent protects its sensitive files (i.e. */.cursor/cli.json) allows attackers to modify the content of the files through prompt injection, thus achieving remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive files on case-insensitive filesystems. This issue is fixed in a commit, 25b418f, but has yet to be released as of October 3, 2025.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:40:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61592 | Cursor CLI: Arbitrary Code Execution Possible through Permissive CLI Config</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61592</link><description>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7 and below, automatic loading of project-specific CLI configuration from the current working directory (/.cursor/cli.json) could override certain global configurations in Cursor CLI. This allowed users running the CLI inside a malicious repository to be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through a combination of permissive configuration (allowing shell commands) and prompt injection delivered via project-specific Rules (/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc) or other mechanisms. The fix for this issue is currently available as a patch 2025.09.17-25b418f. As of October 3, 2025 there is no release version.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:29:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56551 | An issue in DirectAdmin v1.680 allows unauthorized attackers to manipulate the page layout and replace the legitimate login interface with a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56551</link><description>An issue in DirectAdmin v1.680 allows unauthorized attackers to manipulate the page layout and replace the legitimate login interface with arbitrary attacker-controlled content via supplying a crafted GET request.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 17:12:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-42193 | nopCommerce 4.40.3 is vulnerable to XSS in the Product Name at /Admin/Product/Edit/[id].

In versions 1.7 and below, when MCP uses OAuth authentication with an untrusted MCP server, an attacker can impersonate a malicious MCP server and return crafted, maliciously injected commands during the interaction process, leading to command injection and potential remote code execution. If chained with an untrusted MCP service via OAuth, this command injection vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the host by the agent. This can then be used to directly compromise the system by executing malicious commands with full user privileges. This issue does not currently have a fixed release version, but there is a patch, 2025.09.17-25b418f.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:55:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61590 | Cursor is vulnerable to RCE via .code-workspace files using Prompt Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61590</link><description>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6 and below are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks through Visual Studio Code Workspaces. Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:46:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34226 | OpenPLC Runtime v3 Persistent DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34226</link><description>OpenPLC Runtime v3 contains an input validation flaw in the /upload-program-action endpoint: the epoch_time field supplied during program uploads is not validated and can be crafted to induce corruption of the programs database.

In versions 1.6 and below, Mermaid (a to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. Some additional bypasses not covered in the initial fix to this issue were discovered, see GHSA-43wj-mwcc-x93p. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 06:51:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59536 | Claude Code&amp;#x27;s startup trust dialog could lead to  Command Execution attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59536</link><description>Claude Code is an agentic coding tool.
