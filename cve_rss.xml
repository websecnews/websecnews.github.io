Versions 3.3.1 and below are vulnerable to Reflected XSS through its ui.add_css, ui.add_scss, and ui.add_sass functions. The functions lack proper sanitization or encoding for the JavaScript context they generate. An attacker can break out of the intended &lt;style&gt; or &lt;script&gt; tags by injecting closing tags (e.g., &lt;/style&gt; or &lt;/script&gt;), allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. This issue is fixed in version 3.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:01:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66204 | WBCE CMS allows brute-force protection bypass using X-Forwarded-For header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66204</link><description>WBCE CMS is a content management system. Version 1.6.4 contains a brute-force protection bypass where an attacker can indefinitely reset the counter by modifying `X-Forwarded-For` on each request, gaining unlimited password guessing attempts, effectively bypassing all brute-force protection. The application fully trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header without validating it or restricting its usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 23:52:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66202 | Astro has an Authentication Bypass via Double URL Encoding, a bypass for CVE-2025-64765</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66202</link><description>Astro is a web framework. Versions 5.15.7 and below have a double URL encoding bypass which allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765 was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded URLs, attackers can still bypass authentication and access any route protected by middleware pathname checks. This issue is fixed in version 5.15.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 23:52:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65964 | n8n Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Custom Pre-Commit Hook</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65964</link><description>n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions 0.123.1 through 1.119.1 do not have adequate protections to prevent RCE through the project's pre-commit hooks. The Add Config operation allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including core.hooksPath, which can point to a malicious Git hook that executes arbitrary commands on the n8n host during subsequent Git operations. Exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow using the Git node. This issue is fixed in version 1.119.2. Workarounds include excluding the Git Node (Docs) and avoiding cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 23:43:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65962 | Tuleap  has missing CSRF protections its in tracker field dependencies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65962</link><description>Tuleap is a free and open source suite for management of software development and collaboration.

application state (e.g. changing database entries, user data, 
configurations, or other privileged actions) may have been accessible 
via HTTP GET requests without requiring a CSRF token. This flaw leaves 
the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks:
 an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious 
website could cause the user’s browser to issue GET requests that 
perform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their 
authenticated session.


Because the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no 
CSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker 
could exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out
 other unauthorized actions without needing the user’s explicit consent 
or awareness. 

The fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST 
requests and include a valid CSRF token. This enforces that state 
changes cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests.



This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:29:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-42620 | CSRF vulnerability in CIRCL Vulnerability-Lookup</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-42620</link><description>In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled 
content in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to 
stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).




On the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted 
arbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On 
the frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from 
Markdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string 
templates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could 
create or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript 
payloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of 
any user visiting the affected profile page (user.html).

 One-Time Password (OTP) attempts during Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
 verification. An attacker who already knew or guessed a valid username 
and password could submit an arbitrary number of OTP codes without 
causing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert for 
administrators.


This lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly 
lowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and 
increases the risk of successful account takeover, especially if OTP 
entropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric codes, user reuse, or predictable
 tokens). Additionally, administrators had no direct visibility into 
accounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures, making targeted attacks 
harder to detect and investigate.


The patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts counter on user 
accounts, locks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions, resets the 
counter on successful verification, and surfaces failed 2FA attempts in 
the admin user list. This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP 
brute-force attempts and improves monitoring capabilities for suspicious
 2FA activity.This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:29:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14230 | code-projects Daily Time Recording System add_payroll.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14230</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in code-projects Daily Time Recording System 4.5.0.

md/raid0, raid10: Don't set discard sectors for request queue

It should use disk_stack_limits to get a proper max_discard_sectors
rather than setting a value by stack drivers.

And there is a bug. If all member disks are rotational devices,
raid0/raid10 set max_discard_sectors. So the member devices are
not ssd/nvme, but raid0/raid10 export the wrong value. It reports
warning messages in function __blkdev_issue_discard when mkfs.xfs
like this:

pci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned

regulator: core: Use different devices for resource allocation and DT lookup

Following by the below discussion, there's the potential UAF issue
between regulator and mfd.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221128143601.1698148-1-yangyingliang@huawei.com/

From the analysis of Yingliang

CPU A				|CPU B
mt6370_probe()			|
  devm_mfd_add_devices()	|
				|mt6370_regulator_probe()
				|  regulator_register()
				|    //allocate init_data and add it to devres
				|    regulator_of_get_init_data()
i2c_unregister_device()		|
  device_del()			|
    devres_release_all()	|
      // init_data is freed	|
      release_nodes()		|
				|  // using init_data causes UAF
				|  regulator_register()

It's common to use mfd core to create child device for the regulator.
In order to do the DT lookup for init data, the child that registered
the regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes
init data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen
when parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing
some operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.

To fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the
different devices for init data allocation and DT lookup.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50617 | drm/amdgpu/powerplay/psm: Fix memory leak in power state init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register

Chapter "B Generic UART" in "ARM Server Base System Architecture" [1]
documentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART
does not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and
amba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke
pl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This
commit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the
access to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.

When the kernel enables DMA engine with "CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y", Linux
SBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.
For most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write
behaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause
obvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen
virtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.
Xen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is
accessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA
compatible, it will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA
PL011 driver access DMACR register, it will get an unhandled data abort
fault and the application will get a segmentation fault:

media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()

Syzbot reports a memory leak in "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".
The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's
adapter-&gt;priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,
it will exit before incrementing "num_adapters_initalized",
which is used as a reference counter to free all adap-&gt;priv
in "dvb_usb_adapter_exit()". There are multiple error paths that
can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the
error handling paths for "dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()",
"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()" and "dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()"
within "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".

This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the
current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's
adap-&gt;priv is not freed.

Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap-&gt;priv in the
"stream_init_err:" label in the error path. The rest of the
(accounted for) adap-&gt;priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()
as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.

The source of this warning is in iosys_map_clear() called from
dma_buf_vmap(). It conditionally sets values based on map-&gt;is_iomem. The
iosys_map variables are allocated uninitialized on the stack leading to
-&gt;is_iomem having all kinds of values and not only 0/1.

Fix this by zeroing the iosys_map variables.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50629 | wifi: rsi: Fix memory leak in rsi_coex_attach()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50629</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault

The vma_lock and hugetlb_fault_mutex are dropped before handling userfault
and reacquire them again after handle_userfault(), but reacquire the
vma_lock could lead to UAF[1,2] due to the following race,

hugetlb_fault
  hugetlb_no_page
    /*unlock vma_lock */
    hugetlb_handle_userfault
      handle_userfault
        /* unlock mm-&gt;mmap_lock*/

        /* lock vma_lock again  &lt;--- UAF */
    /* unlock vma_lock */

Since the vma_lock will unlock immediately after
hugetlb_handle_userfault(), let's drop the unneeded lock and unlock in
hugetlb_handle_userfault() to fix the issue.

The reason for this is that on certain arm64 configuration since
e35123d83ee3 ("arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when
CONFIG_LTO=y"), READ_ONCE() may be promoted to a full atomic acquire
instruction which cannot be used on unaligned addresses.

Fix it by avoiding READ_ONCE() in read_instrumented_memory(), and simply
forcing the compiler to do the required access by casting to the
appropriate volatile type. In terms of generated code this currently
only affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()
implementation.

The only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the access
itself, although on most architectures a plain load up to machine word
size should still be atomic (a fact the default READ_ONCE() still relies
on itself).</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53743 | PCI: Free released resource after coalescing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver

The device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device
uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the
pointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The
problem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the
kfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the
vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.

Since the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev
object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53747 | vc_screen: reload load of struct vc_data pointer in vcs_write() to avoid UAF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 ("x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000020081000

      size = ksize(ptr);

    size = kmalloc_size_roundup(size);
    ptr = kmalloc(size);

This allowed various crash as reported by syzbot [1]
and Kyle Zeng.

Problem is that if @size is bigger than 0x80000001,
kmalloc_size_roundup(size) returns 2^32.

kmalloc_reserve() uses a 32bit variable (obj_size),
so 2^32 is truncated to 0.

kmalloc(0) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is not handled by
skb allocations.

Following trace can be triggered if a netdev-&gt;mtu is set
close to 0x7fffffff

We might in the future limit netdev-&gt;mtu to more sensible
limit (like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE).

This patch is based on a syzbot report, and also a report
and tentative fix from Kyle Zeng.

scsi: lpfc: Fix ioremap issues in lpfc_sli4_pci_mem_setup()

When if_type equals zero and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)

pointer to iounmap(), which can trigger a WARN() on certain arches.

When if_type equals six and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)
returns true, drbl_regs_memmap_p may has been remapped and
ctrl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This is a resource leak and passes a
NULL pointer to iounmap().

To fix these issues, we need to add null checks before iounmap(), and
change some goto labels.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53755 | dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53755</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback

Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host
shutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue was
the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function
is called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued
queues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being
mistakenly called with a NULL pointer.

KVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs

KVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as
a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,
evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark
that the msr bitmap was changed.

vmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr
-&gt; vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The
function checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is
insufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the
code might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value
left by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be
preempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple
times from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.

The manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the
solution is to use vmx-&gt;vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.

spi: atmel-quadspi: Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()

An early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove() doesn't prevent the device
unbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent
and unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).
So using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.

Instead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware
access and clk disable.

Also add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.
The latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by
the spi core.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53759 | HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device reference
counter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,
resulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.

The race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 ("HID:
hidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem"). While
minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead
acquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF in hci_disconnect_all_sync

Use-after-free can occur in hci_disconnect_all_sync if a connection is
deleted by concurrent processing of a controller event.

To prevent this the code now tries to iterate over the list backwards
to ensure the links are cleanup before its parents, also it no longer
relies on a cursor, instead it always uses the last element since
hci_abort_conn_sync is guaranteed to call hci_conn_del.

    f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly

The root cause is we applied both v1 and v2 of the patch, v2 is the right
fix, so it needs to revert v1 in order to fix reported issue.

v1:
commit d48a7b3a72f1 ("f2fs: fix to do sanity check on extent cache correctly")
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230109034920.492914-1-chao@kernel.org/

v2:

wifi: ath12k: Handle lock during peer_id find

ath12k_peer_find_by_id() requires that the caller hold the
ab-&gt;base_lock. Currently the WBM error path does not hold
the lock and calling that function, leads to the
following lockdep_assert()in QCN9274:

regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers

When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.

This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
allocation num_config_regs number of times.

This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.

virtio-net: fix received length check in big packets

Since commit 4959aebba8c0 ("virtio-net: use mtu size as buffer length
for big packets"), when guest gso is off, the allocated size for big
packets is not MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE anymore but depends on
negotiated MTU. The number of allocated frags for big packets is stored
in vi-&gt;big_packets_num_skbfrags.

Because the host announced buffer length can be malicious (e.g. the host
vhost_net driver's get_rx_bufs is modified to announce incorrect
length), we need a check in virtio_net receive path. Currently, the
check is not adapted to the new change which can lead to NULL page
pointer dereference in the below while loop when receiving length that
is larger than the allocated one.

This commit fixes the received length check corresponding to the new
change.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40293 | iommufd: Don&amp;#x27;t overflow during division for dirty tracking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40293</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In the parse_adv_monitor_pattern() function, the value of
the 'length' variable is currently limited to HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH(251).
The size of the 'value' array in the mgmt_adv_pattern structure is 31.
If the value of 'pattern[i].length' is set in the user space
and exceeds 31, the 'patterns[i].value' array can be accessed
out of bound when copied.

Increasing the size of the 'value' array in
the 'mgmt_adv_pattern' structure will break the userspace.
Considering this, and to avoid OOB access revert the limits for 'offset'
and 'length' back to the value of HCI_MAX_AD_LENGTH.

partition table reading at boot time. The issue is caused by
inode-&gt;i_blkbits being larger than PAGE_SHIFT, which leads to a left

This situation can happen for block devices because when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, the maximum logical_block_size
is 64 KiB. set_init_blocksize() then sets the block device
inode-&gt;i_blkbits to 13, which is within this limit.

File I/O does not trigger this problem because for filesystems that do
not support the FS_LBS feature, sb_set_blocksize() prevents
sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits from being larger than PAGE_SHIFT. During inode
allocation, alloc_inode()-&gt;inode_init_always() assigns inode-&gt;i_blkbits
from sb-&gt;s_blocksize_bits. Currently, only xfs_fs_type has the FS_LBS
flag, and since xfs I/O paths do not reach submit_bh_wbc(), it does not
hit the left-shift underflow issue.

platform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister

regulator_unregister() already frees the associated GPIO device. On
ThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue that leads to
random failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to
allocate interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the
pinctrl_intel_platform module unexpectedly drops to zero when this
driver defers its probe.

This behavior can also be reproduced by unloading the module directly.

Fix the issue by removing the redundant release of the GPIO device
during regulator unregistration.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40297 | net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40297</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass

syzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is
due to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being
deleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been
toggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we
have MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN
filtering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't
happen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled
because we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop
learning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is
initialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port
state bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead
in the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.

btrfs: ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors

[BUG]
During development of a minor feature (make sure all btrfs_bio::end_io()
is called in task context), I noticed a crash in generic/388, where
metadata writes triggered new works after btrfs_stop_all_workers().

It turns out that it can even happen without any code modification, just
using RAID5 for metadata and the same workload from generic/388 is going
to trigger the use-after-free.

[CAUSE]
If btrfs hits an error, the fs is marked as error, no new
transaction is allowed thus metadata is in a frozen state.

But there are some metadata modifications before that error, and they are
still in the btree inode page cache.

Since there will be no real transaction commit, all those dirty folios
are just kept as is in the page cache, and they can not be invalidated
by invalidate_inode_pages2() call inside close_ctree(), because they are
dirty.

And finally after btrfs_stop_all_workers(), we call iput() on btree
inode, which triggers writeback of those dirty metadata.

And if the fs is using RAID56 metadata, this will trigger RMW and queue
new works into rmw_workers, which is already stopped, causing warning
from queue_work() and use-after-free.

[FIX]
Add a special handling for write_one_eb(), that if the fs is already in
an error state, immediately mark the bbio as failure, instead of really
submitting them.

Then during close_ctree(), iput() will just discard all those dirty
tree blocks without really writing them back, thus no more new jobs for
already stopped-and-freed workqueues.

The extra discard in write_one_eb() also acts as an extra safenet.
E.g. the transaction abort is triggered by some extent/free space
tree corruptions, and since extent/free space tree is already corrupted
some tree blocks may be allocated where they shouldn't be (overwriting
existing tree blocks). In that case writing them back will further
corrupting the fs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40304 | fbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40304</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds

Add bounds checking to prevent writes past framebuffer boundaries when

and clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the
X position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update
the character count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size
mismatches.

Without the character count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned
receive mismatched parameters where the buffer is allocated for the clipped
width but cnt reflects the original larger count, causing out-of-bounds writes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40305 | 9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40305</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN

p9_read_work() doesn't set Rworksched and doesn't do schedule_work(m-&gt;rq)
if list_empty(&amp;amp;m-&gt;req_list).

However, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to
work prior to commit aaec5a95d59615 ("pipe_read: don't wake up the writer
if the pipe is still full").

p9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -&gt; ... -&gt; anon_pipe_read() which (before
the commit above) triggered the unnecessary wakeup. This wakeup calls
p9_pollwake() which kicks p9_poll_workfn() -&gt; p9_poll_mux(), p9_poll_mux()
will notice EPOLLIN and schedule_work(&amp;amp;m-&gt;rq).

This no longer happens after the optimization above, change p9_fd_request()
to use p9_poll_mux() instead of only checking for EPOLLOUT.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40306 | orangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40306</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

orangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...

Willy Tarreau  forwarded me a message from
Disclosure  with the following
warning:

&gt; The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition
&gt; rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL
&gt; (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on
&gt; valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging
&gt; the thread.

I easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel
oops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure
sent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based
this patch on.

After xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an
xattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns
a hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs
used hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using
hash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong
hash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a
getattr for the xattr "security.capability" every time. Orangefs
negative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the
xattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for
"security.capability" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were
ever freed.

I changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead
and the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40307 | exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40307</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap

syzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation
bitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without checking
this. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap
is 6, cluster 6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir.
exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing
entries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,
the allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.
This patch adds exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for
the allocation bitmap are correctly marked as in-use.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40308 | Bluetooth: bcsp: receive data only if registered</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40308</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return
addresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without
VM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the
VM_PFNMAP restriction.

Fix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP

usb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget

In the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget
structure (pdev-&gt;gadget) was freed before its endpoints.
The endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.
Freeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.
When the endpoints are subsequently freed, this results in a use-after-free.

Fix:
By separating the usb_del_gadget_udc() operation into distinct "del" and
"put" steps, cdnsp_gadget_free_endpoints() can be executed prior to the
final release of the gadget structure with usb_put_gadget().

A race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently

The ffs-&gt;epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and

wifi: brcmfmac: fix crash while sending Action Frames in standalone AP Mode

Currently, whenever there is a need to transmit an Action frame,
the brcmfmac driver always uses the P2P vif to send the "actframe" IOVAR to
firmware. The P2P interfaces were available when wpa_supplicant is managing
the wlan interface.

However, the P2P interfaces are not created/initialized when only hostapd
is managing the wlan interface. And if hostapd receives an ANQP Query REQ
Action frame even from an un-associated STA, the brcmfmac driver tries
to use an uninitialized P2P vif pointer for sending the IOVAR to firmware.
This NULL pointer dereferencing triggers a driver crash.

Fix this, by always using the vif corresponding to the wdev on which the
Action frame Transmission request was initiated by the userspace. This way,
even if P2P vif is not available, the IOVAR is sent to firmware on AP vif
and the ANQP Query RESP Action frame is transmitted without crashing the
driver.

Move init_completion() for "send_af_done" from brcmf_p2p_create_p2pdev()
to brcmf_p2p_attach(). Because the former function would not get executed
when only hostapd is managing wlan interface, and it is not safe to do
reinit_completion() later in brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame(), without any prior
init_completion().

And in the brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame() function, the condition check for
P2P Presence response frame is not needed, since the wpa_supplicant is
properly sending the P2P Presense Response frame on the P2P-GO vif instead
of the P2P-Device vif.

Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
only the memory of fb_info-&gt;modelist is freed, without setting the
corresponding fb_display[i]-&gt;mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
steps:
1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
   to register a new device /dev/fb1;
2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
   a wild pointer in fb_display[];
5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
   from fb0.

Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 01:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40324 | NFSD: Fix crash in nfsd4_read_release()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40324</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes

NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new
attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it
ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.

RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:

&gt; The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client
&gt; requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the
&gt; target file system. If the server does not support a particular
&gt; attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the
&gt; attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result
&gt; bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
&gt; attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,
&gt; no attribute values will be returned.

Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:

&gt; These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,
&gt; and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR
&gt; by a client holding an appropriate delegation.

Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated
by specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes
via GETATTR is "invalid", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the

xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number

Since commit 30f241fcf52a ("xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor
production"), the descriptor number is stored in skb control block and
xsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto
pool's completion queue.

skb control block shouldn't be used for this purpose as after transmit
xsk doesn't have control over it and other subsystems could use it. This
leads to the following kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
