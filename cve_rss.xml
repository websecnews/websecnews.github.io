This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted. The issue has been addressed in version 2.52.5. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability. Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk: Either implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server, or regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 18:42:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37145 | GHSL-2023-247: Flowise xss in /api/v1/chatflows-streaming/id</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37145</link><description>Flowise is a drag &amp; drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs in the `/api/v1/chatflows-streaming/id` endpoint.

Prior to versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.

The GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances. No public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic and WPS Execute requests. This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

Versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 contain a patch for the issue. A workaround exists by removing the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file from the GeoServer where `x.y` is the GeoTools version (e.g., `gt-complex-31.1.jar` if running GeoServer 2.25.1). This will remove the vulnerable code from GeoServer but may break some GeoServer functionality or prevent GeoServer from deploying if the gt-complex module is needed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 15:40:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6376 | ejson shell parser in MongoDB Compass maybe bypassed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6376</link><description>MongoDB Compass may be susceptible to code injection due to insufficient sandbox protection settings with the usage of ejson shell parser in Compass' connection handling.

Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.1, GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API lists all environment variables and Java properties to any GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules' status message. These variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens. Additionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process. The precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured.

The `about status` API endpoint which powers the Server Status page is only available to administrators.Depending on the operating environment, administrators might have legitimate access to credentials in other ways, but this issue defeats more sophisticated controls (like break-glass access to secrets or role accounts).By default, GeoServer only allows same-origin authenticated API access. This limits the scope for a third-party attacker to use an administrator’s credentials to gain access to credentials. The researchers who found the vulnerability were unable to determine any other conditions under which the GeoServer REST API may be available more broadly.

Users should update container images to use GeoServer 2.24.4 or 2.25.1 to get the bug fix. As a workaround, leave environment variables and Java system properties hidden by default. Those who provide the option to re-enable it should communicate the impact and risks so that users can make an informed choice.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 14:48:19

Tomcat</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24749</link><description>GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3, if GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server, it is possible to bypass existing input validation in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources with specific file name extensions. If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the default password) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment; or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server. One may also disable anonymous access to the embeded GeoWebCache administration and status pages.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 14:28:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6050 | Reflected XSS in SOWA OPAC</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6050</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation vulnerability in SOKRATES-software SOWA OPAC allows a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker might trick somebody into using a crafted URL, which will cause a script to be run in user's browser. This issue affects SOWA OPAC software in versions from 4.0 before 4.9.10, from 5.0 before 6.2.12.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 13:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38953 | phpok 6.4.003 contains a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the ok_f() method under the framework/api/upload_control.php file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38953</link><description>phpok 6.4.003 contains a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the ok_f() method under the framework/api/upload_control.php file.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 13:23:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38987 | aofl cli-lib v3.14.0 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution via the component defaultsDeep.

X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. Prior to versions 3.3.0 and 2.19.4, an attacker could present an ECDSA X.509 certificate using explicit encoding where the parameters are very large. The proof of concept used a 16Kbit prime for this purpose. When parsing, the parameter is checked to be prime, causing excessive computation. This was patched in 2.19.4 and 3.3.0 to allow the prime parameter of the elliptic curve to be at most 521 bits. No known workarounds are available. Note that support for explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in Botan.</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 20:27:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50964 | IBM InfoSphere Information Server cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50964</link><description>IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
