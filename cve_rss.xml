Bluetooth: hci_uart: fix null-ptr-deref in hci_uart_write_work

hci_uart_set_proto() sets HCI_UART_PROTO_INIT before calling
hci_uart_register_dev(), which calls proto-&gt;open() to initialize
hu-&gt;priv. However, if a TTY write wakeup occurs during this window,
hci_uart_tx_wakeup() may schedule write_work before hu-&gt;priv is
initialized, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in
hci_uart_write_work() when proto-&gt;dequeue() accesses hu-&gt;priv.

The race condition is:

                                          // accesses hu-&gt;priv (NULL!)

Fix this by moving set_bit(HCI_UART_PROTO_INIT) after proto-&gt;open()
succeeds, ensuring hu-&gt;priv is initialized before any work can be
scheduled.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23147 | btrfs: zlib: fix the folio leak on S390 hardware acceleration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23147</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zlib: fix the folio leak on S390 hardware acceleration

[BUG]
After commit aa60fe12b4f4 ("btrfs: zlib: refactor S390x HW acceleration
buffer preparation"), we no longer release the folio of the page cache
of folio returned by btrfs_compress_filemap_get_folio() for S390
hardware acceleration path.

[CAUSE]
Before that commit, we call kumap_local() and folio_put() after handling
each folio.

Although the timing is not ideal (it release previous folio at the
beginning of the loop, and rely on some extra cleanup out of the loop),
it at least handles the folio release correctly.

Meanwhile the refactored code is easier to read, it lacks the call to
release the filemap folio.

[FIX]
Add the missing folio_put() for copy_data_into_buffer().</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23148 | nvmet: fix race in nvmet_bio_done() leading to NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix race in nvmet_bio_done() leading to NULL pointer dereference

There is a race condition in nvmet_bio_done() that can cause a NULL
pointer dereference in blk_cgroup_bio_start():

1. nvmet_bio_done() is called when a bio completes
2. nvmet_req_complete() is called, which invokes req-&gt;ops-&gt;queue_response(req)
3. The queue_response callback can re-queue and re-submit the same request
4. The re-submission reuses the same inline_bio from nvmet_req
5. Meanwhile, nvmet_req_bio_put() (called after nvmet_req_complete)
   invokes bio_uninit() for inline_bio, which sets bio-&gt;bi_blkg to NULL
6. The re-submitted bio enters submit_bio_noacct_nocheck()
7. blk_cgroup_bio_start() dereferences bio-&gt;bi_blkg, causing a crash:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028

Fix this by reordering nvmet_bio_done() to call nvmet_req_bio_put()
BEFORE nvmet_req_complete(). This ensures the bio is cleaned up before
the request can be re-submitted, preventing the race condition.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23149 | drm: Do not allow userspace to trigger kernel warnings in drm_gem_change_handle_ioctl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23149</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: Do not allow userspace to trigger kernel warnings in drm_gem_change_handle_ioctl()

Since GEM bo handles are u32 in the uapi and the internal implementation
uses idr_alloc() which uses int ranges, passing a new handle larger than
INT_MAX trivially triggers a kernel warning:

idr_alloc():

Fix it by rejecting new handles above INT_MAX and at the same time make
the end limit calculation more obvious by moving into int domain.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23150 | nfc: llcp: Fix memleak in nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: llcp: Fix memleak in nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame().

syzbot reported various memory leaks related to NFC, struct
nfc_llcp_sock, sk_buff, nfc_dev, etc. [0]

The leading log hinted that nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() failed
to allocate skb due to sock_error(sk) being -ENXIO.

ENXIO is set by nfc_llcp_socket_release() when struct
nfc_llcp_local is destroyed by local_cleanup().

The problem is that there is no synchronisation between
nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame() and local_cleanup(), and skb
could be put into local-&gt;tx_queue after it was purged in
local_cleanup():

                                       ^._________________________________.'

local_cleanup() is called for struct nfc_llcp_local only
after nfc_llcp_remove_local() unlinks it from llcp_devices.

If we hold local-&gt;tx_queue.lock then, we can synchronise
the thread and nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame().

Let's do that and check list_empty(&amp;local-&gt;list) before
queuing skb to local-&gt;tx_queue in nfc_llcp_send_ui_frame().

Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete

Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete() where mgmt_pending_cmd structures
are not freed after being removed from the pending list.

Commit 302a1f674c00 ("Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix possible UAFs") replaced
mgmt_pending_foreach() calls with individual command handling but missed
adding mgmt_pending_free() calls in both error and success paths of
set_ssp_complete(). Other completion functions like set_le_complete()
were fixed correctly in the same commit.

This causes a memory leak of the mgmt_pending_cmd structure and its
associated parameter data for each SSP command that completes.

Add the missing mgmt_pending_free(cmd) calls in both code paths to fix
the memory leak. Also fix the same issue in set_advertising_complete().</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23152 | wifi: mac80211: correctly decode TTLM with default link map</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23152</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix segmentation of forwarding fraglist GRO

This patch enhances GSO segment handling by properly checking
the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag for frag_list GSO packets, addressing
low throughput issues observed when a station accesses IPv4
servers via hotspots with an IPv6-only upstream interface.

Specifically, it fixes a bug in GSO segmentation when forwarding
GRO packets containing a frag_list. The function skb_segment_list
cannot correctly process GRO skbs that have been converted by XLAT,
since XLAT only translates the header of the head skb. Consequently,
skbs in the frag_list may remain untranslated, resulting in protocol
inconsistencies and reduced throughput.

To address this, the patch explicitly sets the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag
for GSO packets in XLAT's IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation helpers
(bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6 and bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4). This marks GSO
packets as potentially modified after protocol translation. As a
result, GSO segmentation will avoid using skb_segment_list and
instead falls back to skb_segment for packets with the SKB_GSO_DODGY
flag. This ensures that only safe and fully translated frag_list
packets are processed by skb_segment_list, resolving protocol
inconsistencies and improving throughput when forwarding GRO packets
converted by XLAT.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23155 | can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix error message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23155</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not strictly require dirty metadata threshold for metadata writepages

[BUG]
There is an internal report that over 1000 processes are
waiting at the io_schedule_timeout() of balance_dirty_pages(), causing
a system hang and trigger a kernel coredump.

The kernel is v6.4 kernel based, but the root problem still applies to
any upstream kernel before v6.18.

[CAUSE]
From Jan Kara for his wisdom on the dirty page balance behavior first.

  This cgroup dirty limit was what was actually playing the role here
  because the cgroup had only a small amount of memory and so the dirty
  limit for it was something like 16MB.

  Dirty throttling is responsible for enforcing that nobody can dirty
  (significantly) more dirty memory than there's dirty limit. Thus when
  a task is dirtying pages it periodically enters into balance_dirty_pages()
  and we let it sleep there to slow down the dirtying.

  When the system is over dirty limit already (either globally or within
  a cgroup of the running task), we will not let the task exit from
  balance_dirty_pages() until the number of dirty pages drops below the
  limit.

  So in this particular case, as I already mentioned, there was a cgroup
  with relatively small amount of memory and as a result with dirty limit
  set at 16MB. A task from that cgroup has dirtied about 28MB worth of
  pages in btrfs btree inode and these were practically the only dirty
  pages in that cgroup.

So that means the only way to reduce the dirty pages of that cgroup is
to writeback the dirty pages of btrfs btree inode, and only after that
those processes can exit balance_dirty_pages().

Now back to the btrfs part, btree_writepages() is responsible for
writing back dirty btree inode pages.

The problem here is, there is a btrfs internal threshold that if the
btree inode's dirty bytes are below the 32M threshold, it will not
do any writeback.

This behavior is to batch as much metadata as possible so we won't write
back those tree blocks and then later re-COW them again for another
modification.

This internal 32MiB is higher than the existing dirty page size (28MiB),
meaning no writeback will happen, causing a deadlock between btrfs and
cgroup:

- Btrfs doesn't want to write back btree inode until more dirty pages

- Cgroup/MM doesn't want more dirty pages for btrfs btree inode
  Thus any process touching that btree inode is put into sleep until
  the number of dirty pages is reduced.

Thanks Jan Kara a lot for the analysis of the root cause.

[ENHANCEMENT]
Since kernel commit b55102826d7d ("btrfs: set AS_KERNEL_FILE on the
btree_inode"), btrfs btree inode pages will only be charged to the root
cgroup which should have a much larger limit than btrfs' 32MiB
threshold.
So it should not affect newer kernels.

But for all current LTS kernels, they are all affected by this problem,
and backporting the whole AS_KERNEL_FILE may not be a good idea.

Even for newer kernels I still think it's a good idea to get
rid of the internal threshold at btree_writepages(), since for most cases
cgroup/MM has a better view of full system memory usage than btrfs' fixed
threshold.

For internal callers using btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() since that
function is already doing internal threshold check, we don't need to
bother them.

But for external callers of btree_writepages(), just respect their
requests and write back whatever they want, ignoring the internal
btrfs threshold to avoid such deadlock on btree inode dirty page
balancing.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23158 | gpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23158</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path

The gpio-virtuser configfs release path uses guard(mutex) to protect
the device structure. However, the device is freed before the guard
cleanup runs, causing mutex_unlock() to operate on freed memory.

Specifically, gpio_virtuser_device_config_group_release() destroys
the mutex and frees the device while still inside the guard(mutex)
scope. When the function returns, the guard cleanup invokes
mutex_unlock(&amp;dev-&gt;lock), resulting in a slab use-after-free.

Limit the mutex lifetime by using a scoped_guard() only around the
activation check, so that the lock is released before mutex_destroy()
and kfree() are called.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23159 | perf: sched: Fix perf crash with new is_user_task() helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23159</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: sched: Fix perf crash with new is_user_task() helper

In order to do a user space stacktrace the current task needs to be a user
task that has executed in user space. It use to be possible to test if a
task is a user task or not by simply checking the task_struct mm field. If
it was non NULL, it was a user task and if not it was a kernel task.

But things have changed over time, and some kernel tasks now have their
own mm field.

An idea was made to instead test PF_KTHREAD and two functions were used to
wrap this check in case it became more complex to test if a task was a
user task or not[1]. But this was rejected and the C code simply checked
the PF_KTHREAD directly.

It was later found that not all kernel threads set PF_KTHREAD. The io-uring
helpers instead set PF_USER_WORKER and this needed to be added as well.

But checking the flags is still not enough. There's a very small window
when a task exits that it frees its mm field and it is set back to NULL.
If perf were to trigger at this moment, the flags test would say its a
user space task but when perf would read the mm field it would crash with
at NULL pointer dereference.

Now there are flags that can be used to test if a task is exiting, but
they are set in areas that perf may still want to profile the user space
task (to see where it exited). The only real test is to check both the
flags and the mm field.

Instead of making this modification in every location, create a new

octeon_ep: Fix memory leak in octep_device_setup()

In octep_device_setup(), if octep_ctrl_net_init() fails, the function
returns directly without unmapping the mapped resources and freeing the
allocated configuration memory.

Fix this by jumping to the unsupported_dev label, which performs the
necessary cleanup. This aligns with the error handling logic of other
paths in this function.

Compile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool
and code review.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23161 | mm/shmem, swap: fix race of truncate and swap entry split</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23161</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/shmem, swap: fix race of truncate and swap entry split

The helper for shmem swap freeing is not handling the order of swap
entries correctly.  It uses xa_cmpxchg_irq to erase the swap entry, but it
gets the entry order before that using xa_get_order without lock
protection, and it may get an outdated order value if the entry is split
or changed in other ways after the xa_get_order and before the
xa_cmpxchg_irq.

And besides, the order could grow and be larger than expected, and cause
truncation to erase data beyond the end border.  For example, if the
target entry and following entries are swapped in or freed, then a large
folio was added in place and swapped out, using the same entry, the
xa_cmpxchg_irq will still succeed, it's very unlikely to happen though.

To fix that, open code the Xarray cmpxchg and put the order retrieval and
value checking in the same critical section.  Also, ensure the order won't
exceed the end border, skip it if the entry goes across the border.

Skipping large swap entries crosses the end border is safe here.  Shmem
truncate iterates the range twice, in the first iteration,
find_lock_entries already filtered such entries, and shmem will swapin the
entries that cross the end border and partially truncate the folio (split
the folio or at least zero part of it).  So in the second loop here, if we
see a swap entry that crosses the end order, it must at least have its
content erased already.

I observed random swapoff hangs and kernel panics when stress testing
ZSWAP with shmem.  After applying this patch, all problems are gone.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23162 | drm/xe/nvm: Fix double-free on aux add failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23162</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/nvm: Fix double-free on aux add failure

After a successful auxiliary_device_init(), aux_dev-&gt;dev.release
(xe_nvm_release_dev()) is responsible for the kfree(nvm). When
there is failure with auxiliary_device_add(), driver will call
auxiliary_device_uninit(), which call put_device(). So that the
.release callback will be triggered to free the memory associated
with the auxiliary_device.

Move the kfree(nvm) into the auxiliary_device_init() failure path
and remove the err goto path to fix below error.

v2: drop err goto path. (Alexander)

drm/amdgpu: fix NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_gmc_filter_faults_remove

On APUs such as Raven and Renoir (GC 9.1.0, 9.2.2, 9.3.0), the ih1 and
ih2 interrupt ring buffers are not initialized. This is by design, as
these secondary IH rings are only available on discrete GPUs. See
vega10_ih_sw_init() which explicitly skips ih1/ih2 initialization when
AMD_IS_APU is set.

However, amdgpu_gmc_filter_faults_remove() unconditionally uses ih1 to
get the timestamp of the last interrupt entry. When retry faults are
enabled on APUs (noretry=0), this function is called from the SVM page
fault recovery path, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
amdgpu_ih_decode_iv_ts_helper() attempts to access ih-&gt;ring[].

The crash manifests as:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000004
  RIP: 0010:amdgpu_ih_decode_iv_ts_helper+0x22/0x40 [amdgpu]

This issue was exposed by commit 1446226d32a4 ("drm/amdgpu: Remove GC HW
IP 9.3.0 from noretry=1") which changed the default for Renoir APU from
noretry=1 to noretry=0, enabling retry fault handling and thus
exercising the buggy code path.

Fix this by adding a check for ih1.ring_size before attempting to use
it. Also restore the soft_ih support from commit dd299441654f ("drm/amdgpu:
Rework retry fault removal").  This is needed if the hardware doesn't
support secondary HW IH rings.

rocker: fix memory leak in rocker_world_port_post_fini()

In rocker_world_port_pre_init(), rocker_port-&gt;wpriv is allocated with
kzalloc(wops-&gt;port_priv_size, GFP_KERNEL). However, in
rocker_world_port_post_fini(), the memory is only freed when
wops-&gt;port_post_fini callback is set:

    if (!wops-&gt;port_post_fini)
        return;
    wops-&gt;port_post_fini(rocker_port);
    kfree(rocker_port-&gt;wpriv);

Since rocker_ofdpa_ops does not implement port_post_fini callback
(it is NULL), the wpriv memory allocated for each port is never freed
when ports are removed. This leads to a memory leak of
sizeof(struct ofdpa_port) bytes per port on every device removal.

Fix this by always calling kfree(rocker_port-&gt;wpriv) regardless of
whether the port_post_fini callback exists.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23165 | sfc: fix deadlock in RSS config read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23165</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: nci: Fix race between rfkill and nci_unregister_device().

syzbot reported the splat below [0] without a repro.

It indicates that struct nci_dev.cmd_wq had been destroyed before
nci_close_device() was called via rfkill.

nci_dev.cmd_wq is only destroyed in nci_unregister_device(), which
(I think) was called from virtual_ncidev_close() when syzbot close()d
an fd of virtual_ncidev.

The problem is that nci_unregister_device() destroys nci_dev.cmd_wq
first and then calls nfc_unregister_device(), which removes the
device from rfkill by rfkill_unregister().

So, the device is still visible via rfkill even after nci_dev.cmd_wq
is destroyed.

Let's unregister the device from rfkill first in nci_unregister_device().

Note that we cannot call nfc_unregister_device() before
nci_close_device() because

  1) nfc_unregister_device() calls device_del() which frees
     all memory allocated by devm_kzalloc() and linked to
     ndev-&gt;conn_info_list

  2) nci_rx_work() could try to queue nci_conn_info to
     ndev-&gt;conn_info_list which could be leaked

Thus, nfc_unregister_device() is split into two functions so we
can remove rfkill interfaces only before nci_close_device().

Note that a deadlock like this is only possible if the bdi has configured
maximum fraction of writeout throughput which is very rare in general but
frequent for example for FUSE bdis.  To fix this problem we have to make
sure write section of the sequence counter is irqsafe.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23169 | mptcp: fix race in mptcp_pm_nl_flush_addrs_doit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23169</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: fix use-after-free due to enslave fail after slave array update

Fix a use-after-free which happens due to enslave failure after the new
slave has been added to the array. Since the new slave can be used for Tx
immediately, we can use it after it has been freed by the enslave error
cleanup path which frees the allocated slave memory. Slave update array is
supposed to be called last when further enslave failures are not expected.
Move it after xdp setup to avoid any problems.

It is very easy to reproduce the problem with a simple xdp_pass prog:
 ip l add bond1 type bond mode balance-xor
 ip l set bond1 up
 ip l set dev bond1 xdp object xdp_pass.o sec xdp_pass
 ip l add dumdum type dummy

Then run in parallel:
 while :; do ip l set dumdum master bond1 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; done;
 mausezahn bond1 -a own -b rand -A rand -B 1.1.1.1 -c 0 -t tcp "dp=1-1023, flags=syn"

The crash happens almost immediately:

net: wwan: t7xx: fix potential skb-&gt;frags overflow in RX path

When receiving data in the DPMAIF RX path,
the t7xx_dpmaif_set_frag_to_skb() function adds
page fragments to an skb without checking if the number of
fragments has exceeded MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This could lead to a buffer overflow
in skb_shinfo(skb)-&gt;frags[] array, corrupting adjacent memory and
potentially causing kernel crashes or other undefined behavior.

This issue was identified through static code analysis by comparing with a
similar vulnerability fixed in the mt76 driver commit b102f0c522cf ("mt76:
fix array overflow on receiving too many fragments for a packet").

The vulnerability could be triggered if the modem firmware sends packets
with excessive fragments. While under normal protocol conditions (MTU 3080
bytes, BAT buffer 3584 bytes),
a single packet should not require additional
fragments, the kernel should not blindly trust firmware behavior.
Malicious, buggy, or compromised firmware could potentially craft packets
with more fragments than the kernel expects.

Fix this by adding a bounds check before calling skb_add_rx_frag() to
ensure nr_frags does not exceed MAX_SKB_FRAGS.

The check must be performed before unmapping to avoid a page leak
and double DMA unmap during device teardown.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 16:43:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23173 | net/mlx5e: TC, delete flows only for existing peers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23173</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/sva: invalidate stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space

Introduce a new IOMMU interface to flush IOTLB paging cache entries for
the CPU kernel address space.  This interface is invoked from the x86
architecture code that manages combined user and kernel page tables,
specifically before any kernel page table page is freed and reused.

This addresses the main issue with vfree() which is a common occurrence
and can be triggered by unprivileged users.  While this resolves the
primary problem, it doesn't address some extremely rare case related to
memory unplug of memory that was present as reserved memory at boot, which
cannot be triggered by unprivileged users.  The discussion can be found at
the link below.

Enable SVA on x86 architecture since the IOMMU can now receive
notification to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page
table pages.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:50:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23141 | btrfs: send: check for inline extents in range_is_hole_in_parent()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23141</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Before accessing the disk_bytenr field of a file extent item we need
to check if we are dealing with an inline extent.
This is because for inline extents their data starts at the offset of
the disk_bytenr field. So accessing the disk_bytenr
means we are accessing inline data or in case the inline data is less
than 8 bytes we can actually cause an invalid
memory access if this inline extent item is the first item in the leaf
or access metadata from other items.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:50:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23142 | mm/damon/sysfs-scheme: cleanup access_pattern subdirs on scheme dir setup failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23142</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_net: Fix misalignment bug in struct virtnet_info

Use the new TRAILING_OVERLAP() helper to fix a misalignment bug
along with the following warning:

drivers/net/virtio_net.c:429:46: warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]

This helper creates a union between a flexible-array member (FAM)
and a set of members that would otherwise follow it (in this case
`u8 rss_hash_key_data[VIRTIO_NET_RSS_MAX_KEY_SIZE];`). This
overlays the trailing members (rss_hash_key_data) onto the FAM
(hash_key_data) while keeping the FAM and the start of MEMBERS aligned.
The static_assert() ensures this alignment remains.

Notice that due to tail padding in flexible `struct
virtio_net_rss_config_trailer`, `rss_trailer.hash_key_data`
(at offset 83 in struct virtnet_info) and `rss_hash_key_data` (at
offset 84 in struct virtnet_info) are misaligned by one byte. See
below:

struct virtio_net_rss_config_trailer {
        __le16                     max_tx_vq;            /*     0     2 */
        __u8                       hash_key_length;      /*     2     1 */
        __u8                       hash_key_data[];      /*     3     0 */

        /* size: 4, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
        /* padding: 1 */
        /* last cacheline: 4 bytes */
};

struct virtnet_info {
...
        struct virtio_net_rss_config_trailer rss_trailer; /*    80     4 */

        /* XXX last struct has 1 byte of padding */

        u8                         rss_hash_key_data[40]; /*    84    40 */
...
        /* size: 832, cachelines: 13, members: 48 */
        /* sum members: 801, holes: 8, sum holes: 31 */
        /* paddings: 2, sum paddings: 5 */
};

After changes, those members are correctly aligned at offset 795:

struct virtnet_info {
...
        union {
                struct virtio_net_rss_config_trailer rss_trailer; /*   792     4 */
                struct {
                        unsigned char __offset_to_hash_key_data[3]; /*   792     3 */
                        u8         rss_hash_key_data[40]; /*   795    40 */
                };                                       /*   792    43 */
        };                                               /*   792    44 */
...
        /* size: 840, cachelines: 14, members: 47 */
        /* sum members: 801, holes: 8, sum holes: 35 */
        /* padding: 4 */
        /* paddings: 1, sum paddings: 4 */
        /* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
};

As a result, the RSS key passed to the device is shifted by 1
byte: the last byte is cut off, and instead a (possibly
uninitialized) byte is added at the beginning.

As a last note `struct virtio_net_rss_config_hdr *rss_hdr;` is also
moved to the end, since it seems those three members should stick
around together. :)</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:50:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23144 | mm/damon/sysfs: cleanup attrs subdirs on context dir setup failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23144</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The 'cto=5fb2' indicates the collected file pos we've collected results to
so far - but we still have 0x4e more bytes to go - so we shouldn't have
collected folio ix=00005 yet.  The 'ZERO' subreq that clears the tail
happens after we unlock the folio, allowing the application to see the
uncleared tail through mmap.

The problem is that netfs_read_unlock_folios() will unlock a folio in which
the amount of read results collected hits EOF position - but the ZERO
subreq lies beyond that and so happens after.

Fix this by changing the end check to always be the end of the folio and
never the end of the file.

In the future, I should look at clearing to the end of the folio here rather
than adding a ZERO subreq to do this.  On the other hand, the ZERO subreq can
run in parallel with an async READ subreq.  Further, the ZERO subreq may still
be necessary to, say, handle extents in a ceph file that don't have any
backing store and are thus implicitly all zeros.

This can be reproduced by creating a file, the size of which doesn't align
to a page boundary, e.g. 24998 (0x5fb2) bytes and then doing something
like:

    xfs_io -c "mmap -r 0 0x6000" -c "madvise -d 0 0x6000" \
           -c "mread -v 0 0x6000" /xfstest.test/x

The last 0x4e bytes should all be 00, but if the tail hasn't been cleared
yet, you may see rubbish there.  This can be reproduced with kafs by
modifying the kernel to disable the call to netfs_read_subreq_progress()
and to stop afs_issue_read() from doing the async call for NETFS_READAHEAD.
Reproduction can be made easier by inserting an mdelay(100) in
netfs_issue_read() for the ZERO-subreq case.

AFS and CIFS are normally unlikely to show this as they dispatch READ ops
asynchronously, which allows the ZERO-subreq to finish first.  9P's READ op is
completely synchronous, so the ZERO-subreq will always happen after.  It isn't
seen all the time, though, because the collection may be done in a worker
thread.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23132 | drm/bridge: synopsys: dw-dp: fix error paths of dw_dp_bind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23132</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: synopsys: dw-dp: fix error paths of dw_dp_bind

Fix several issues in dw_dp_bind() error handling:

1. Missing return after drm_bridge_attach() failure - the function
   continued execution instead of returning an error.

2. Resource leak: drm_dp_aux_register() is not a devm function, so
   drm_dp_aux_unregister() must be called on all error paths after
   aux registration succeeds. This affects errors from:
   - drm_bridge_attach()
   - phy_init()
   - devm_add_action_or_reset()
   - platform_get_irq()
   - devm_request_threaded_irq()

3. Bug fix: platform_get_irq() returns the IRQ number or a negative
   error code, but the error path was returning ERR_PTR(ret) instead
   of ERR_PTR(dp-&gt;irq).

Use a goto label for cleanup to ensure consistent error handling.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23133 | wifi: ath10k: fix dma_free_coherent() pointer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23133</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: fix kmalloc_nolock() context check for PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, local_lock becomes a sleeping lock. The current
check in kmalloc_nolock() only verifies we're not in NMI or hard IRQ
context, but misses the case where preemption is disabled.

When a BPF program runs from a tracepoint with preemption disabled
(preempt_count &gt; 0), kmalloc_nolock() proceeds to call
local_lock_irqsave() which attempts to acquire a sleeping lock,
triggering:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 6128
  preempt_count: 2, expected: 0

Fix this by checking !preemptible() on PREEMPT_RT, which directly
expresses the constraint that we cannot take a sleeping lock when
preemption is disabled. This encompasses the previous checks for NMI
and hard IRQ contexts while also catching cases where preemption is
disabled.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23135 | wifi: ath12k: fix dma_free_coherent() pointer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23135</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libceph: reset sparse-read state in osd_fault()

When a fault occurs, the connection is abandoned, reestablished, and any
pending operations are retried. The OSD client tracks the progress of a
sparse-read reply using a separate state machine, largely independent of
the messenger's state.

If a connection is lost mid-payload or the sparse-read state machine
returns an error, the sparse-read state is not reset. The OSD client
will then interpret the beginning of a new reply as the continuation of
the old one. If this makes the sparse-read machinery enter a failure
state, it may never recover, producing loops like:

  libceph:  [0] got 0 extents
  libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0
  libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read
  libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0
  libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read

A bug was reported about an infinite recursion caused by tracing the rcu
events with the kernel stack trace trigger enabled. The stack trace code
called back into RCU which then called the stack trace again.

Expand the ftrace recursion protection to add a set of bits to protect
events from recursion. Each bit represents the context that the event is
in (normal, softirq, interrupt and NMI).

Have the stack trace code use the interrupt context to protect against
recursion.

Note, the bug showed an issue in both the RCU code as well as the tracing
stacktrace code. This only handles the tracing stack trace side of the

The RCU fix will be handled separately.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23139 | netfilter: nf_conncount: update last_gc only when GC has been performed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23139</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, test_run: Subtract size of xdp_frame from allowed metadata size

The xdp_frame structure takes up part of the XDP frame headroom,
limiting the size of the metadata. However, in bpf_test_run, we don't
take this into account, which makes it possible for userspace to supply
a metadata size that is too large (taking up the entire headroom).

If userspace supplies such a large metadata size in live packet mode,
the xdp_update_frame_from_buff() call in xdp_test_run_init_page() call
will fail, after which packet transmission proceeds with an
uninitialised frame structure, leading to the usual Bad Stuff.

The commit in the Fixes tag fixed a related bug where the second check
in xdp_update_frame_from_buff() could fail, but did not add any
additional constraints on the metadata size. Complete the fix by adding
an additional check on the metadata size. Reorder the checks slightly to
make the logic clearer and add a comment.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71200 | mmc: sdhci-of-dwcmshc: Prevent illegal clock reduction in HS200/HS400 mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71200</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/io-wq: check IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT inside work run loop

Currently this is checked before running the pending work. Normally this
is quite fine, as work items either end up blocking (which will create a
new worker for other items), or they complete fairly quickly. But syzbot
reports an issue where io-wq takes seemingly forever to exit, and with a
bit of debugging, this turns out to be because it queues a bunch of big
(2GB - 4096b) reads with a /dev/msr* file. Since this file type doesn't
support -&gt;read_iter(), loop_rw_iter() ends up handling them. Each read
returns 16MB of data read, which takes 20 (!!) seconds. With a bunch of
these pending, processing the whole chain can take a long time. Easily
longer than the syzbot uninterruptible sleep timeout of 140 seconds.
This then triggers a complaint off the io-wq exit path:

There's really nothing wrong here, outside of processing these reads
will take a LONG time. However, we can speed up the exit by checking the
IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT inside the io_worker_handle_work() loop, as syzbot will
exit the ring after queueing up all of these reads. Then once the first
item is processed, io-wq will simply cancel the rest. That should avoid
syzbot running into this complaint again.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23114 | arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Fix SVE writes on !SME systems</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23114</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Fix SVE writes on !SME systems

When SVE is supported but SME is not supported, a ptrace write to the
NT_ARM_SVE regset can place the tracee into an invalid state where
(non-streaming) SVE register data is stored in FP_STATE_SVE format but
TIF_SVE is clear. This can result in a later warning from
fpsimd_restore_current_state(), e.g.

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 7214 at arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c:383 fpsimd_restore_current_state+0x50c/0x748

When this happens, fpsimd_restore_current_state() will set TIF_SVE,
placing the task into the correct state. This occurs before any other
check of TIF_SVE can possibly occur, as other checks of TIF_SVE only
happen while the FPSIMD/SVE/SME state is live. Thus, aside from the
warning, there is no functional issue.

This bug was introduced during rework to error handling in commit:

  9f8bf718f2923 ("arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Gracefully handle errors")

... where the setting of TIF_SVE was moved into a block which is only
executed when system_supports_sme() is true.

Fix this by removing the system_supports_sme() check. This ensures that
TIF_SVE is set for (SVE-formatted) writes to NT_ARM_SVE, at the cost of
unconditionally manipulating the tracee's saved svcr value. The
manipulation of svcr is benign and inexpensive, and we already do
similar elsewhere (e.g. during signal handling), so I don't think it's
worth guarding this with system_supports_sme() checks.

Aside from the above, there is no functional change. The 'type' argument
to sve_set_common() is only set to ARM64_VEC_SME (in ssve_set())) when
system_supports_sme(), so the ARM64_VEC_SME case in the switch statement
is still unreachable when !system_supports_sme(). When
CONFIG_ARM64_SME=n, the only caller of sve_set_common() is sve_set(),
and the compiler can constant-fold for the case where type is
ARM64_VEC_SVE, removing the logic for other cases.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23115 | serial: Fix not set tty-&amp;gt;port race condition</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: add missing ice_deinit_hw() in devlink reinit path

devlink-reload results in ice_init_hw failed error, and then removing

Commit 1390b8b3d2be ("ice: remove duplicate call to ice_deinit_hw() on

ice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but
ice_devlink_reinit_up() still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control
queues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails with -EBUSY.

Add ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with
ice_init_hw() in ice_devlink_reinit_up().</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23118 | rxrpc: Fix data-race warning and potential load/store tearing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23118</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix data-race warning and potential load/store tearing

Fix the following:

        BUG: KCSAN: data-race in rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker / rxrpc_send_data_packet

which is reporting an issue with the reads and writes to -&gt;last_tx_at in:

        conn-&gt;peer-&gt;last_tx_at = ktime_get_seconds();

and:

        keepalive_at = peer-&gt;last_tx_at + RXRPC_KEEPALIVE_TIME;

The lockless accesses to these to values aren't actually a problem as the
read only needs an approximate time of last transmission for the purposes
of deciding whether or not the transmission of a keepalive packet is
warranted yet.

Also, as -&gt;last_tx_at is a 64-bit value, tearing can occur on a 32-bit
arch.

Fix both of these by switching to an unsigned int for -&gt;last_tx_at and only
storing the LSW of the time64_t.  It can then be reconstructed at need
provided no more than 68 years has elapsed since the last transmission.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23119 | bonding: provide a net pointer to __skb_flow_dissect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23119</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The previous 7 KB per queue caused TX unit hangs under heavy

the TSN recommendation in I225/I226 SW User Manual Section 7.5.4.

The 8 KB "freed" by this change is currently unused. This reduction
is not expected to impact throughput, as the i226 is PCIe-limited
for small TSN packets rather than TX-buffer-limited.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23123 | interconnect: debugfs: initialize src_node and dst_node to empty strings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23123</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The issue is triggered when sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() fails in
sctp_sf_do_5_1C_ack() while processing an INIT_ACK. In this case, the
command sequence is currently:

- SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT
- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP (T1_INIT)
- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_START (T1_COOKIE)
- SCTP_CMD_NEW_STATE (COOKIE_ECHOED)
- SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY
- SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO

If SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY fails, asoc-&gt;shkey remains NULL, while
asoc-&gt;peer.auth_capable and asoc-&gt;peer.peer_chunks have already been set by
SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT. This allows a DATA chunk with auth = 1 and shkey = NULL
to be queued by sctp_datamsg_from_user().

Since command interpretation stops on failure, no COOKIE_ECHO should been
sent via SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO. However, the T1_COOKIE timer has already
been started, and it may enqueue a COOKIE_ECHO into the outqueue later. As
a result, the DATA chunk can be transmitted together with the COOKIE_ECHO
in sctp_outq_flush_data(), leading to the observed issue.

Similar to the other places where it calls sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key()
right after sctp_process_init(), this patch moves the SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY
immediately after SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT, before stopping T1_INIT and starting
T1_COOKIE. This ensures that if shared key generation fails, authenticated
DATA cannot be sent. It also allows the T1_INIT timer to retransmit INIT,
giving the client another chance to process INIT_ACK and retry key setup.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23126 | netdevsim: fix a race issue related to the operation on bpf_bound_progs list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23126</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix refcount warning on event-&gt;mmap_count increment

When calling refcount_inc(&amp;amp;event-&gt;mmap_count) inside perf_mmap_rb(), the
following warning is triggered:

        refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
        WARNING: lib/refcount.c:25

PoC:

    struct perf_event_attr attr = {0};
    int fd = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &amp;amp;attr, 0, -1, -1, 0);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    int victim = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &amp;amp;attr, 0, -1, fd,
                         PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, victim, 0);

This occurs when creating a group member event with the flag
PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT. The group leader should be mmap-ed and then mmap-ing
the event triggers the warning.

Since the event has copied the output_event in perf_event_set_output(),
event-&gt;rb is set. As a result, perf_mmap_rb() calls
refcount_inc(&amp;amp;event-&gt;mmap_count) when event-&gt;mmap_count = 0.

Disallow the case when event-&gt;mmap_count = 0. This also prevents two
events from updating the same user_page.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23128 | arm64: Set __nocfi on swsusp_arch_resume()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: Set __nocfi on swsusp_arch_resume()

A DABT is reported[1] on an android based system when resume from hiberate.
This happens because swsusp_arch_suspend_exit() is marked with SYM_CODE_*()
and does not have a CFI hash, but swsusp_arch_resume() will attempt to
verify the CFI hash when calling a copy of swsusp_arch_suspend_exit().

Given that there's an existing requirement that the entrypoint to
swsusp_arch_suspend_exit() is the first byte of the .hibernate_exit.text
section, we cannot fix this by marking swsusp_arch_suspend_exit() with
SYM_FUNC_*(). The simplest fix for now is to disable the CFI check in
swsusp_arch_resume().

Mark swsusp_arch_resume() as __nocfi to disable the CFI check.

dpll: Prevent duplicate registrations

Modify the internal registration helpers dpll_xa_ref_{dpll,pin}_add()
to reject duplicate registration attempts.

Previously, if a caller attempted to register the same pin multiple
times (with the same ops, priv, and cookie) on the same device, the core
silently increments the reference count and return success. This behavior
is incorrect because if the caller makes these duplicate registrations
then for the first one dpll_pin_registration is allocated and for others
the associated dpll_pin_ref.refcount is incremented. During the first
unregistration the associated dpll_pin_registration is freed and for
others WARN is fired.

Fix this by updating the logic to return `-EEXIST` if a matching
registration is found to enforce a strict "register once" policy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23130 | wifi: ath12k: fix dead lock while flushing management frames</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23130</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix dead lock while flushing management frames

Commit [1] converted the management transmission work item into a
wiphy work. Since a wiphy work can only run under wiphy lock
protection, a race condition happens in below scenario:

1. a management frame is queued for transmission.
2. ath12k_mac_op_flush() gets called to flush pending frames associated
   with the hardware (i.e, vif being NULL). Then in ath12k_mac_flush()
   the process waits for the transmission done.
3. Since wiphy lock has been taken by the flush process, the transmission
   work item has no chance to run, hence the dead lock.

&gt;From user view, this dead lock results in below issue:

 wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)
 wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)
 wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)
 wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)
 wlp8s0: authenticated
 wlp8s0: associate with xxxxxx (try 1/3)
 wlp8s0: aborting association with xxxxxx by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)
 ath12k_pci 0000:08:00.0: failed to flush mgmt transmit queue, mgmt pkts pending 1

The dead lock can be avoided by invoking wiphy_work_flush() to proactively
run the queued work item. Note actually it is already present in
ath12k_mac_op_flush(), however it does not protect the case where vif
being NULL. Hence move it ahead to cover this case as well.

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kobject warnings for empty attribute names

The hp-bioscfg driver attempts to register kobjects with empty names when
the HP BIOS returns attributes with empty name strings. This causes
multiple kernel warnings:

  WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 3336 at lib/kobject.c:219 kobject_add_internal+0x2eb/0x310

Add validation in hp_init_bios_buffer_attribute() to check if the
attribute name is empty after parsing it from the WMI buffer. If empty,
log a debug message and skip registration of that attribute, allowing the
module to continue processing other valid attributes.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:29:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2312 | Media Library Folders &amp;lt;= 8.3.6 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary Attachment Deletion and Rename</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2312</link><description>The Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.6 via the delete_maxgalleria_media() and maxgalleria_rename_image() functions due to missing validation on a user controlled key.

The issue exists in the RUNVM instruction logic (VmState::run_child_vm), which is responsible for initializing child virtual machines. The operation moves critical resources (specifically libraries and log) from the parent state to a new child state in a non-atomic manner. If an Out-of-Gas (OOG) exception occurs after resources are moved but before the state transition is finalized, the parent VM retains a corrupted state where these resources are emptied/invalid. Because RUNVM supports gas isolation, the parent VM continues execution with this corrupted state, leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service within the contract's context.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 21:45:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26333 | Calero VeraSMART &amp;lt; 2022 R1 .NET Remoting Arbitrary File Read Leading to ViewState RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26333</link><description>Calero VeraSMART versions prior to 2022 R1 expose an unauthenticated .NET Remoting HTTP service on TCP port 8001.

An attacker who can reach the service can send crafted .NET Remoting requests to default HTTP channel endpoints on TCP/8900 (e.g., TimerServiceAPI.rem and TimerServiceEvents.rem for Workflow) to trigger unsafe object unmarshalling, enabling arbitrary file read/write. By writing attacker-controlled content into web-accessible locations or chaining with other OnBase features, this can lead to remote code execution.

netfilter: nf_tables: fix inverted genmask check in nft_map_catchall_activate()

nft_map_catchall_activate() has an inverted element activity check
compared to its non-catchall counterpart nft_mapelem_activate() and
compared to what is logically required.

nft_map_catchall_activate() is called from the abort path to re-activate
catchall map elements that were deactivated during a failed transaction.
It should skip elements that are already active (they don't need
re-activation) and process elements that are inactive (they need to be
restored). Instead, the current code does the opposite: it skips inactive
elements and processes active ones.

Compare the non-catchall activate callback, which is correct:

  nft_mapelem_activate():
    if (nft_set_elem_active(ext, iter-&gt;genmask))
        return 0;   /* skip active, process inactive */

With the buggy catchall version:

  nft_map_catchall_activate():
    if (!nft_set_elem_active(ext, genmask))
        continue;   /* skip inactive, process active */

The consequence is that when a DELSET operation is aborted,
nft_setelem_data_activate() is never called for the catchall element.
For NFT_GOTO verdict elements, this means nft_data_hold() is never
called to restore the chain-&gt;use reference count. Each abort cycle
permanently decrements chain-&gt;use. Once chain-&gt;use reaches zero,
DELCHAIN succeeds and frees the chain while catchall verdict elements
still reference it, resulting in a use-after-free.

This is exploitable for local privilege escalation from an unprivileged
user via user namespaces + nftables on distributions that enable
CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NF_TABLES.

Fix by removing the negation so the check matches nft_mapelem_activate():
skip active elements, process inactive ones.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:10:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23112 | nvmet-tcp: add bounds checks in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23112</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Prior to 0.4.0, a vulnerability was identified in the Terminal component of the arduino-app-lab application. The issue stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of input data received from connected hardware devices, specifically in the _info.Serial and _info.Address metadata fields. The problem occurs during device information handling. When a board is connected, the application collects identifying attributes to establish a terminal session. Because strict validation is not enforced for the Serial and Address parameters, an attacker with control over the connected hardware can supply specially crafted strings containing shell metacharacters.

Prior to 1.11.2, FrankenPHP’s CGI path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters during case conversion. The logic computes the split index (for finding .php) on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies that byte index to the original path. Because strings.ToLower() in Go can increase the byte length of certain UTF-8 characters (e.g., Ⱥ expands when lowercased), the computed index may not align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a file other than the one intended by the URI.

Prior to 17.0.5 and 16.0.17, FreePBX module api (PBX API) is vulnerable to privilege escalation by authenticated users with REST/GraphQL API access. This vulnerability allows an attacker to forge a valid JWT with full access to the REST and GraphQL APIs on a FreePBX that they've already connected to, possibly as a lower privileged user. The JWT is signed using the api-oauth.key private key. An attacker can generate their own token if they possess this key (e.g., by accessing an affected instance), and specify any scopes they wish (e.g., rest, gql), bypassing traditional authorization checks. However, FreePBX enforces that the jti (JWT ID) claim must exist in the database (api_access_tokens table in the asterisk MySQL database) in order for the token to be accepted. Therefore, the attacker must know a jti value that already exists on the target instance. This vulnerability is fixed in 17.0.5 and 16.0.17.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61880 | In Infoblox NIOS through 9.0.7, insecure deserialization can result in remote code execution.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61880</link><description>In Infoblox NIOS through 9.0.7, insecure deserialization can result in remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56647 | npm @farmfe/core before 1.7.6 is Missing Origin Validation in WebSocket.

The `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).

### Details
When the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.

**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):
```js
if (val &amp;&amp; typeof val === 'string' &amp;&amp; options.comma &amp;&amp; val.indexOf(',') &gt; -1) {
    return val.split(',');
}

if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded &amp;&amp; currentArrayLength &gt;= options.arrayLimit) {
    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');
}

return val;
```
The `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).

### PoC
**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**
```
npm install qs
```

```js
const qs = require('qs');

const payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)
const options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };

try {
  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);
  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown
}
```
**Configuration:**
- `comma: true`
- `arrayLimit: 5`
- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`

Expected: Throws "Array limit exceeded" error.
Actual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.
