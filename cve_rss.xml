Affected versions of the json-web-token library are vulnerable to a JWT algorithm confusion attack. On line 86 of the 'index.js' file, the algorithm to use for verifying the signature of the JWT token is taken from the JWT token, which at that point is still unverified and thus shouldn't be trusted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work against this library is the RS256 algorithm is in use, however it is a best practice to use that algorithm.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 21:40:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48294 | Broken Access control on Graphs Feature in LibreNMS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48294</link><description>LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
