btrfs: fix deadlock with fiemap and extent locking

While working on the patchset to remove extent locking I got a lockdep
splat with fiemap and pagefaulting with my new extent lock replacement
lock.

This deadlock exists with our normal code, we just don't have lockdep
annotations with the extent locking so we've never noticed it.

Since we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration
we have the chance of pagefaulting.  Because we hold the extent lock for
the entire range we could mkwrite into a range in the file that we have
mmap'ed.  This would deadlock with the following stack trace

[&lt;0&gt;] lock_extent+0x28d/0x2f0

[&lt;0&gt;] do_syscall_64+0x94/0x1a0
[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76

I wrote an fstest to reproduce this deadlock without my replacement lock
and verified that the deadlock exists with our existing locking.

To fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of
the fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we
are when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in
the middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents
because we know what offset we were on before.

The only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the
delalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent
range so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're
checking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.

With this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:33:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35785 | tee: optee: Fix kernel panic caused by incorrect error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35785</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute group

The DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace before
typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means that
a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp-&gt;hpd in
hpd_show or dp-&gt;lock in pin_assignment_show, as dev_get_drvdata() returns
NULL in those cases.

Remove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group as
default for devices bound to the driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is
not used here otherwise the path to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant
with the ABI.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35791 | KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm-&amp;gt;lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35791</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm-&gt;lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()

Do the cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() before
dropping kvm-&gt;lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or its
array of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has
__unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.

Note, the "obvious" alternative of using local variables doesn't fully
resolve the bug, as region-&gt;pages is also dynamically allocated.  I.e. the
region structure itself would be fine, but region-&gt;pages could be freed.

Flushing multiple pages under kvm-&gt;lock is unfortunate, but the entire
flow is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that
lack coherency for encrypted memory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35792 | crypto: rk3288 - Fix use after free in unprepare</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35792</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove

Ben Greear further reports deadlocks during concurrent debugfs
remove while files are being accessed, even though the code in
question now uses debugfs cancellations. Turns out that despite
all the review on the locking, we missed completely that the
logic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and
need not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we have
to trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_
get into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, and

dm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend

1) commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread") remove
   MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from __md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that
   dm-raid relies on __md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread
   indirectly. Fix this problem by adding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in
   md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread() is only used for
   dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() to
   md_stop_writes().
2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that sync thread is frozen,
   it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can't stop the
   running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after seting the
   flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used.
3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that writes are stopped, use
   it as condition for md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't
   look correct. Consider that reentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing,
   always call md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend().
4) raid_message can set/clear the flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime,
   and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared while the array is suspended,
   new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this by disallow
   raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend.

Note that after commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread"), the
test shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(),
and with previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the
test will still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this
patch, the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4
is corrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to
dm-raid456 that will be fixed in following patches.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:34:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5045 | SourceCodester Online Birth Certificate Management System admin file access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5045</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Birth Certificate Management System 1.0.

x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type

On 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input
value is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get
lost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical
address to provide a virtual address for.

One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), where
the GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bit
bit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly into
pfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addresses
above the 1TB range due to the above.

Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that
might cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,
instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to the
expected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.

While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, other
archs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances like
this, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:

  e48866647b48 ("ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()")

A C inline function is even better though.

media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts

The driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupt
handlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISP
is powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the
ISP registers.

This can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:
Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will
hang.

Fix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail
out from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 12:34:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27432 | net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27432</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we
need a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held

It's currently possible to change the mesh ID when the
interface isn't yet in mesh mode, at the same time as
changing it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwrite
of data in the wdev-&gt;u union for the interface type it
currently has, causing cfg80211_change_iface() to do
wrong things when switching.

We could probably allow setting an interface to mesh
while setting the mesh ID at the same time by doing a
different order of operations here, but realistically
there's no userspace that's going to do this, so just
disallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27411 | drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27411</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume

Nouveau deallocates a few buffers post GPU init which are required for GPU suspend/resume to function correctly.
This is likely not as big an issue on systems where the NVGPU is the only GPU, but on multi-GPU set ups it leads to a regression where the kernel module errors and results in a system-wide rendering freeze.

This commit addresses that regression by moving the two buffers required for suspend and resume to be deallocated at driver unload instead of post init.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27412 | power: supply: bq27xxx-i2c: Do not free non existing IRQ</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27412</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back

In the commit d73ef2d69c0d ("rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks
IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE length"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logic
in the function `rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check
the length of the IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment
removed the `break` statement and led to an error logic of the flags
writing back at the end of this function.

if (have_flags)
    memcpy(nla_data(attr), &amp;amp;flags, sizeof(flags));
    // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!!

Before the mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.
However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will let
the attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could cause
overflow writes.

This patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save the NLA pointer
that points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve the mentioned
error logic.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27415 | netfilter: bridge: confirm multicast packets before passing them up the stack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27415</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: bridge: confirm multicast packets before passing them up the stack

conntrack nf_confirm logic cannot handle cloned skbs referencing
the same nf_conn entry, which will happen for multicast (broadcast)
frames on bridges.

 Example:
    macvlan0
       |
      br0
     /  \
  ethX    ethY

 ethX (or Y) receives a L2 multicast or broadcast packet containing
 an IP packet, flow is not yet in conntrack table.

 1. skb passes through bridge and fake-ip (br_netfilter)Prerouting.
    -&gt; skb-&gt;_nfct now references a unconfirmed entry
 2. skb is broad/mcast packet. bridge now passes clones out on each bridge
    interface.
 3. skb gets passed up the stack.
 4. In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb
    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.

    The clone skb-&gt;_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the
    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.
 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.

The Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.

This race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that
case later steps perform skb_clone() with skb-&gt;_nfct already confirmed (in
hash table).  This works fine.

But such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the
packets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.

Pablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful
nat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call
conntrack again.

This doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat
transformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting
via 'sabotage_in' hook.

Work around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN
time, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.

The downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.

Alternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with
unconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this
opens up other problems, for example:

-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4
-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5

For multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be
created, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.

Users should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic
NOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass
them, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,
so user-visible behaviour would change.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:58:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27416 | Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix handling of HCI_EV_IO_CAPA_REQUEST</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27416</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: ncm: Avoid dropping datagrams of properly parsed NTBs

It is observed sometimes when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11
as host, at some instances, the gadget_giveback has one byte appended at
the end of a proper NTB. When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for
any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending
bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the
second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that
were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.

Adding a few custom traces showed the following:
[002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==&gt; 0
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10
[002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames

In this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024.
The rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of
all datagrams in rx_list.

Same is case with packets of size 2048:
[002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==&gt; 0
[002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800

Lecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming
in from PC:

 Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)
 - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)
 --- Packet 4063861
       Data(1024 bytes)

       Data(1 byte)
       Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)

According to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero,
because the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the
size of transfer to be expected. However, there are in-market NCM devices
that rely on ZLP as long as the wBlockLength is multiple of wMaxPacketSize.
To deal with such devices, it pads an extra 0 at end so the transfer is no
longer multiple of wMaxPacketSize.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 11:48:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27406 | lib/Kconfig.debug: TEST_IOV_ITER depends on MMU</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27406</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Users who ran Sunshine versions 0.17.0 through 0.22.2 as a service on Windows may be impacted when terminating the service if an attacked placed a file named `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program.bat`, or `C:\Program.cmd` on the user's computer. This attack vector isn't exploitable unless the user has manually loosened ACLs on the system drive. If the user's system locale is not English, then the name of the executable will likely vary. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. Alternatively, ensure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level directory `C:`. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected directories.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 18:26:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5023 | Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability in ConsoleMe via Limited Git command RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5023</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in Netflix ConsoleMe allows Command Injection.This issue affects ConsoleMe: before 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 18:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1417 | Local Code Injection Vulnerability in AuthPoint Password Manager App for macOS Safari</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1417</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in WatchGuard AuthPoint Password Manager on MacOS allows an a adversary with local access to execute code under the context of the AuthPoint Password Manager application.

The product allows users to configure authorization checks as shell commands through the tac_plus.cfg configuration file. These are executed when a client sends an authorization request with a username that has pre-authorization directives configured. However, it is possible to inject additional commands into these checks because strings from TACACS+ packets are used as command-line arguments. If the installation lacks a a pre-shared secret (there is no pre-shared secret by default), then the injection can be triggered without authentication. (The attacker needs to know a username configured to use a pre-authorization command.)

slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34273 | njwt up to v0.4.0 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution in the Parser.prototype.parse method.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34273</link><description>njwt up to v0.4.0 was discovered to contain a prototype pollution in the Parser.prototype.parse method.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35176 | REXML contains a denial of service vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35176</link><description>REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby.

Prior to version 0.0.49, the Minder REST ingester is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via an attacker-controlled REST endpoint that can crash the Minder server. The REST ingester allows users to interact with REST endpoints to fetch data for rule evaluation. When fetching data with the REST ingester, Minder sends a request to an endpoint and will use the data from the body of the response as the data to evaluate against a certain rule. If the response is sufficiently large, it can drain memory on the machine and crash the Minder server. The attacker can control the remote REST endpoints that Minder sends requests to, and they can configure the remote REST endpoints to return responses with large bodies. They would then instruct Minder to send a request to their configured endpoint that would return the large response which would crash the Minder server. Version 0.0.49 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35187 | Stalwart Mail Server has privilege escalation by design</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35187</link><description>Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0, attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system. Usually, system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore, other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user, but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way, so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server, but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system, as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability, may be vulnerable. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 15:28:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4609 | Rockwell Automation Datalog Function within in FactoryTalk® View SE contains SQL Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4609</link><description>A vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk® View SE Datalog function that could allow a threat actor to inject a malicious SQL statement if the SQL database has no authentication in place or if legitimate credentials were stolen.

other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used
to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range
32-bit code would be able to set them to.

When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,
the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so
involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves
a certain amount of translation of the values.

Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a
consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 13:43:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31142 | x86: Incorrect logic for BTC/SRSO mitigations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31142</link><description>Because of a logical error in XSA-407 (Branch Type Confusion), the

A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user’s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update ` with a remote URL outside of github.com. Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.10 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 21:30:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4913 | Campcodes Online Examination System exam.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4913</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Campcodes Online Examination System 1.0.

Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:38:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35108 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;dataType=&amp;data...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35108</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;amp;dataType=&amp;amp;dataTypeCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35109 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;nohrefStr=close.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35109</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;amp;nohrefStr=close.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4199 | Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress &amp;lt;= 4.2.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Missing Authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4199</link><description>The Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on the plugin's AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.3.
