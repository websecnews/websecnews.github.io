In version 1.38 and prior, the `makefile-ubuntu.yml` workflow file uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the `z80pack-ubuntu` artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated `.git/config` file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client before 2.1.1 when performing connections to untrusted servers. Such servers could abuse the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be bypassed.

The .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization. The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method for the future.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:32:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29209 | TOTOLINK X18 v9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329 has an unauthorized arbitrary command execution in the enable parameter' of the sub_41105C function of ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29209</link><description>TOTOLINK X18 v9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329 has an unauthorized arbitrary command execution in the enable parameter' of the sub_41105C function of cstecgi .cgi.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:16:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3792 | SeaCMS admin_link.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3792</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in SeaCMS up to 13.3.

HSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &amp;amp;ssi-&gt;work is bound with
ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function
within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the
work.

If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()
to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence
of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                    CPU1

                        | ssip_xmit_work
ssi_protocol_remove     |
kfree(ssi);             |
                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi-&gt;cl;
                        | // use ssi

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding
with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:34:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29643 | An issue in croogo v.3.0.2 allows an attacker to perform Host header injection via the feed.rss component.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29643</link><description>An issue in croogo v.3.0.2 allows an attacker to perform Host header injection via the feed.rss component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29625 | A buffer overflow vulnerability in Astrolog v7.70 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via an overl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29625</link><description>A buffer overflow vulnerability in Astrolog v7.70 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via an overly long environment variable passed to FileOpen function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 14:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40364 | io_uring: fix io_req_prep_async with provided buffers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40364</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir

Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir
entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later
on, when the corrupted directory is removed).

ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'
and '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads
the '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()
and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir
entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the
same data block.

If the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the
sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data
block) and leaves "struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de" point exactly past the
memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to
ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer
which results in out-of-bounds mem access.

Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir
entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony
dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).

Note: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another
structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is
really an OOB read.

This issue was found by syzkaller tool.

LoongArch: BPF: Fix off-by-one error in build_prologue()

Vincent reported that running BPF progs with tailcalls on LoongArch
causes kernel hard lockup. Debugging the issues shows that the JITed
image missing a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.

There are two passes in JIT compiling, the first pass set the flags and
the second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With BPF progs
mixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls, build_prologue() generates N insns in the
first pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes
epilogue_offset off by one and we will jump to some unexpected insn and
cause lockup. Fix this by inserting a nop insn.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37925 | jfs: reject on-disk inodes of an unsupported type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37925</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This happens when 'clear_inode()' makes an attempt to finalize an underlying
JFS inode of unknown type. According to JFS layout description from
https://jfs.sourceforge.net/project/pub/jfslayout.pdf, inode types from 5 to
15 are reserved for future extensions and should not be encountered on a valid
filesystem. So add an extra check for valid inode type in 'copy_from_dinode()'.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38049 | x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors

Commit

  6eac36bb9eb0 ("x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid")

added logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirty
cache lines when creating a new control group, if requested by the arch code.
This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is
applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the
monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused
monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.

This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This
causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the
array was not allocated by dom_data_init().

As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy
monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is
allocated.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38104 | drm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38104</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV

RLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU
registers in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and
register reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same
registers simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the
RLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This
means that only one thread can access the registers at a time,
preventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed
correctly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a
high-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to
acquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in
amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.

The call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being
called, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked
from amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from
gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.

The [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to
acquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep
(like holding a spinlock).

Fixes the below:

remoteproc: core: Clear table_sz when rproc_shutdown

There is case as below could trigger kernel dump:
Use U-Boot to start remote processor(rproc) with resource table
published to a fixed address by rproc. After Kernel boots up,
stop the rproc, load a new firmware which doesn't have resource table
,and start rproc.

When starting rproc with a firmware not have resource table,
`memcpy(loaded_table, rproc-&gt;cached_table, rproc-&gt;table_sz)` will
trigger dump, because rproc-&gt;cache_table is set to NULL during the last
stop operation, but rproc-&gt;table_sz is still valid.

This issue is found on i.MX8MP and i.MX9.

The function mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() may be called before the
`mtk_dp-&gt;drm_dev` pointer is assigned in mtk_dp_bridge_attach().
Specifically it can be called via this callpath:
 - mtk_edp_wait_hpd_asserted
 - [panel probe]
 - dp_aux_ep_probe

Using "drm" level prints anywhere in this callpath causes a NULL
pointer dereference. Change the error message directly in
mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() to dev_err() to avoid this. Also change the
error messages in mtk_dp_parse_capabilities(), which is called by
mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted().

While touching these prints, also add the error code to them to make

net_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertions

In the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertion
that fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc under
TBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at
packets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are
unavailable.

This peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc
queue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,
SKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its
internal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.

The fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not
necessary at all.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39688 | nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39688</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()

The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a
delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the
deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets
bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.

When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with
SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked
with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for
s FREE_STATEID call.

nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status
flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask
never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations
are (almost) never found.

Add SC_STATUS_FREEABLE to the always-allowed status flags, and remove it
from nfsd4_delegreturn() since it's now always implied.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39728 | clk: samsung: Fix UBSAN panic in samsung_clk_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39728</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the "size_check" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
"ea_get: invalid extended attribute" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
"size" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The "size" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called "len" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
"int remaining", which is then assigned to "int linelen" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i &lt; len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the "ptr+i" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of "ptr", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j &lt; len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen &lt; lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

To fix this we should validate "EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-&gt;xattr)"
before it is utilised.</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:25:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39755 | staging: gpib: Fix cb7210 pcmcia Oops</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39755</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context

Patch series "mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling",
v4.

## 1. What am I trying to do:

This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure
handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as
compared to 5.10 LTS.

    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space
    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space

## 2. What is the expected outcome and why

- For copyin case:

Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or
copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return
-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler
checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be
recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code
specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.

- For instr case:

If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery
is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills
by reading from storage.


## 3. What actually happens and why

- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17

Commit 4c132d1d844a ("x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage") introduced a new
extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the
extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from
EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS
handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().

- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI
  and #MCE race

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA
signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when
the data is about to be consumed.

### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]

Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that
detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a
broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action
Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because
it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that
bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE
interrupts and finally become an IERR.

Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub
from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to
#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in
uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*
signature name.

### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in
    Intel platform [1]

Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,
the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is
executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference
between a "real" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if
an error is found in any read.

Thus:

1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a
   speculative read.

2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read
   request

3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the
   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.

Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory
controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction
reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page
(marking it as poison).


## Why user process is killed for instr case
