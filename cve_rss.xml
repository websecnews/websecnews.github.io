This is due to the `BaseModel` class constructor calling `maybe_unserialize()` on all properties retrieved from the database without validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object by submitting a double-serialized payload through any public-facing form that sends email (e.g., Contact Form 7). When the email is logged and subsequently viewed by an administrator, the malicious payload is deserialized into an arbitrary PHP object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 06:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1542 | Super Stage WP &amp;lt;= 1.0.1 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1542</link><description>The Super Stage WP WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 unserializes user input via REQUEST, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present on the blog.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 06:53:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28426 | Statamic vulnerable to privilege escalation via stored cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28426</link><description>Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS).

Prior to versions 5.73.11 and 6.4.0, when Glide image manipulation is used in insecure mode (which is not the default), the image proxy can be abused by an unauthenticated user to make the server send HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs—either via the URL directly or via the watermark feature. That can allow access to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and other hosts reachable from the server. This has been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 22:46:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28424 | Statamic&amp;#x27;s missing authorization allows access to email addresses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28424</link><description>Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to versions 5.73.11 and 6.4.0, user email addresses were included in responses from the user fieldtype’s data endpoint for control panel users who did not have the "view users" permission.

Prior to versions 5.73.11 and 6.4.0, an authenticated control panel user with access to Antlers-enabled inputs may be able to achieve remote code execution in the application context. That can lead to full compromise of the application, including access to sensitive configuration, modification or exfiltration of data, and potential impact on availability. Exploitation is only possible where Antlers runs on user-controlled content—for example, content fields with Antlers explicitly enabled (requiring permission to configure fields and to edit entries), built-in config that supports Antlers such as Forms email notification settings (requiring configuration permission), or third-party addons that add Antlers-enabled fields to entries (for example, the SEO Pro addon). In each case the attacker must have the relevant control panel permissions. This has been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0. Users of addons that depend on Statamic should ensure that after updating they are running a patched Statamic version.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 22:46:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28515 | openDCIM &amp;lt;= 23.04 Missing Authorization in install.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28515</link><description>openDCIM version 23.04, through commit 4467e9c4, contains a missing authorization vulnerability in install.php and container-install.php.

Starting in version 4.16.0 and prior to version 6.6.0, Gradio applications running outside of Hugging Face Spaces automatically enable "mocked" OAuth routes when OAuth components (e.g. `gr.LoginButton`) are used.

The session cookie is signed with a hardcoded secret derived from the string `"-v4"`, making the payload trivially decodable.

Versions prior to 1.0.16 expose a  POST `/engines/_configure`  endpoint that accepts arbitrary runtime flags without authentication. These flags are passed directly to the underlying inference server (llama.cpp). By injecting the  --log-file  flag, an attacker with network access to the Model Runner API can write or overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the Model Runner process. When bundled with Docker Desktop (where Model Runner is enabled by default since version 4.46.0), it is reachable from any default container at  model-runner.docker.internal  without authentication. In this context, the file overwrite can target the Docker Desktop VM disk (`Docker.raw` ), resulting in the destruction of all containers, images, volumes, and build history. However, in specific configurations and with user interaction, it is possible to convert this vulnerability in a container escape. The issue is fixed in Docker Model Runner 1.0.16. Docker Desktop users should update to 4.61.0 or later, which includes the fixed Model Runner. A workaround is available. For Docker Desktop users, enabling Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) blocks container access to Model Runner, preventing exploitation. However, if the Docker Model Runner is exposed to localhost over TCP in specific configurations, the vulnerability is still exploitable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:36:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-28402 | nimiq/core-rs-albatross&amp;#x27;s nimiq-blockchain missing proposal body root verification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-28402</link><description>nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm.

A missing authorization vulnerability has been identified in the application starting in version 2.7.0 and prior to version 3.1.0. It allows authenticated users to access and modify data belonging to other users. This issue is due to the absence of the `isOwnProfileOrAdmin()` middleware on several push subscription API routes.

This issue appears to affect all of Unitree’s current offerings as of February 26, 2026, and so should be considered a vulnerability in both the firmware generation and extraction processes. At the time of this release, there is no publicly-documented mechanism to subvert the update process and insert poisoned firmware packages without the equipment owner’s knowledge.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:05:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1558 | WP Recipe Maker &amp;lt;= 10.3.2 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Metadata Modification via &amp;#x27;recipeId&amp;#x27; Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1558</link><description>The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in versions up to, and including, 10.3.2.

The functions `addr2cidr` and `cidrlookup` may return leading zeros in a CIDR string, which may in turn be parsed as octal numbers by subsequent users. In some cases an attacker may be able to leverage this to bypass access controls based on IP addresses.

The documentation advises validating untrusted CIDR strings with the `cidrvalidate` function. However, this mitigation is optional and not enforced by default. In practice, users may call `addr2cidr` or `cidrlookup` with untrusted input and without validation, incorrectly assuming that this is safe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 01:04:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-20742 | Copeland XWEB and XWEB Pro OS Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20742</link><description>An OS command injection
