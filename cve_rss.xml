In a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug where
a check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it was
noted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index
into a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.

If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possible
for the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function would
then cause a NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to trigger
this has not been established, harden this caller against the

kunit/overflow: Fix UB in overflow_allocation_test

The 'device_name' array doesn't exist out of the
'overflow_allocation_test' function scope. However, it is being used as
a driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from

wifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nss

Currently, if the access point receives an association
request containing an Extended HE Capabilities Information
Element with an invalid MCS-NSS, it triggers a firmware
crash.

This issue arises when EHT-PHY capabilities shows support
for a bandwidth and MCS-NSS set for that particular
bandwidth is filled by zeros and due to this, driver obtains
peer_nss as 0 and sending this value to firmware causes
crash.

Address this issue by implementing a validation step for
the peer_nss value before passing it to the firmware. If
the value is greater than zero, proceed with forwarding
it to the firmware. However, if the value is invalid,
reject the association request to prevent potential
firmware crashes.

sched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness

In sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,
when running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the
round-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active
bulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.

This has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a
hash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of
the hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,
and if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host
state to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the
host(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is
assigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host
anymore, are incremented again).

Back when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always
enabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration
flags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but
the *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious
decrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).

AFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around
happens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in
itself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this
is harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is
enabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first
be configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this
mode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the
qdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the
array out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and
used as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,
which is quite impressive in its own right.

This patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on
decrement as is used on increment.

The original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed
in the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply
before that.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46829 | rtmutex: Drop rt_mutex::wait_lock before scheduling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtmutex: Drop rt_mutex::wait_lock before scheduling

rt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutex::wait_lock held.  In the
good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a
warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which
triggers the 'scheduling in atomic' warning.

Unlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning

KVM: x86: Acquire kvm-&gt;srcu when handling KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS

Grab kvm-&gt;srcu when processing KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, as KVM will forcibly
leave nested VMX/SVM if SMM mode is being toggled, and leaving nested VMX
reads guest memory.

Note, kvm_vcpu_ioctl_x86_set_vcpu_events() can also be called from KVM_RUN
via sync_regs(), which already holds SRCU.  I.e. trying to precisely use
kvm_vcpu_srcu_read_lock() around the problematic SMM code would cause
problems.  Acquiring SRCU isn't all that expensive, so for simplicity,
grab it unconditionally for KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS.

Commit 0d1b7d6c9274 ("bnxt: fix crashes when reducing ring count with

channels with out of bounds IDs may lead to crashes. Currently the
max channel check in the core gets skipped if driver can't fetch
the indirection table or when we can't allocate memory.

Both of those conditions should be extremely rare but if they do
happen we should try to be safe and fail the channel change.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46835 | drm/amdgpu: Fix smatch static checker warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46835</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_create

We were allowing any users to create a high priority group without any
permission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of
service.

We now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE
capability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.

As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of
MEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.

Additionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,
panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.

Since khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file

We could also remove the preceding "if (unlikely(...))" block, but then we
could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file

but I think is not necessarily expected.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46839 | workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46839</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch

On a ~2000 CPU powerpc system, hard lockups have been observed in the
workqueue code when stop_machine runs (in this case due to CPU hotplug).
This is due to lots of CPUs spinning in multi_cpu_stop, calling
touch_nmi_watchdog() which ends up calling wq_watchdog_touch().
wq_watchdog_touch() writes to the global variable wq_watchdog_touched,
and that can find itself in the same cacheline as other important
workqueue data, which slows down operations to the point of lockups.

In the case of the following abridged trace, worker_pool_idr was in
the hot line, causing the lockups to always appear at idr_find.

  watchdog: CPU 1125 self-detected hard LOCKUP @ idr_find
  Call Trace:
  get_work_pool

Fix this by having wq_watchdog_touch() only write to the line if the
last time a touch was recorded exceeds 1/4 of the watchdog threshold.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46840 | btrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46840</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete

In reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we aren't
holding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient
incorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which
could happen if we have extent tree corruption.  Change that to return
-EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly,
however we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code.
Finally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert
that to proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we can
actually do something with the information.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46841 | btrfs: don&amp;#x27;t BUG_ON on ENOMEM from btrfs_lookup_extent_info() in walk_down_proc()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46841</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info

The MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the
routine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of
return status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware
returns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region
references previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.

Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox
resource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not
timeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources
because it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later
time in its cmpl routine.

Also, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot
scripts requiring longer timeouts.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46843 | scsi: ufs: core: Remove SCSI host only if added</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46843</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If host tries to remove ufshcd driver from a UFS device it would cause a

tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists

The timerlat tracer can use user space threads to check for osnoise and
timer latency. If the program using this is killed via a SIGTERM, the
threads are shutdown one at a time and another tracing instance can start
up resetting the threads before they are fully closed. That causes the
hrtimer assigned to the kthread to be shutdown and freed twice when the
dying thread finally closes the file descriptors, causing a use-after-free
bug.

Only cancel the hrtimer if the associated thread is still around. Also add
the interface_lock around the resetting of the tlat_var-&gt;kthread.

Note, this is just a quick fix that can be backported to stable. A real
fix is to have a better synchronization between the shutdown of old
threads and the starting of new ones.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46846 | spi: rockchip: Resolve unbalanced runtime PM / system PM handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46846</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: rockchip: Resolve unbalanced runtime PM / system PM handling

Commit e882575efc77 ("spi: rockchip: Suspend and resume the bus during
NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM ops") stopped respecting runtime PM status and
simply disabled clocks unconditionally when suspending the system. This
causes problems when the device is already runtime suspended when we go
to sleep -- in which case we double-disable clocks and produce a
WARNing.

Switch back to pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}(), because that still
seems like the right thing to do, and the aforementioned commit makes no
explanation why it stopped using it.

Also, refactor some of the resume() error handling, because it's not
actually a good idea to re-disable clocks on failure.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46847 | mm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46847</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue

Commit 8c61291fd850 ("mm: fix incorrect vbq reference in
purge_fragmented_block") extended the 'vmap_block' structure to contain a
'cpu' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialising
CPU.

When a new 'vmap_block' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), the
partially initialised structure is added to the local 'vmap_block_queue'
xarray before the 'cpu' field has been initialised.  If another CPU is
concurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it
may perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an
uninitialised index.

This has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:

Thanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low
initial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers
the defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the
details, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)

The HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL
event, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the
same as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum
period of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.

HSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the
Hyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware
has more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message
'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed
with a period &lt; 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum
period of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.
The recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.
Because it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings
extra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue
has been reported so far.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46849 | ASoC: meson: axg-card: fix &amp;#x27;use-after-free&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46849</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn35_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()

dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe
context passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.

If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which
calls dcn35_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulled
function callback fields of struct stream_resource.

The logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tg
against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and
before the next access, then we get a race.

Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable, and then use this

drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn10_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()

dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe
context passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.

If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which
calls dcn10_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulled
function callback fields of struct stream_resource.

The logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tg
against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and
before the next access, then we get a race.

Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable, and then use this
variable for all the operations. This should work, as long as nobody
frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

dma-buf: heaps: Fix off-by-one in CMA heap fault handler

Until VM_DONTEXPAND was added in commit 1c1914d6e8c6 ("dma-buf: heaps:
Don't track CMA dma-buf pages under RssFile") it was possible to obtain
a mapping larger than the buffer size via mremap and bypass the overflow
check in dma_buf_mmap_internal. When using such a mapping to attempt to
fault past the end of the buffer, the CMA heap fault handler also checks
the fault offset against the buffer size, but gets the boundary wrong by
1. Fix the boundary check so that we don't read off the end of the pages
array and insert an arbitrary page in the mapping.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46853 | spi: nxp-fspi: fix the KASAN report out-of-bounds bug</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46853</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The bridge mode is only relevant when there are multiple functions per
port. Therefore, prevent setting and getting this setting when there are no
VFs.

Note that after this change, there are no settings to change on the PF
interface using `bridge link` when there are no VFs, so the interface no

In remove_anno_list_by_saddr(running on CPU2), after leaving the critical
zone protected by "pm.lock", the entry will be released, which leads to the
occurrence of uaf in the mptcp_pm_del_add_timer(running on CPU1).

Keeping a reference to add_timer inside the lock, and calling
sk_stop_timer_sync() with this reference, instead of "entry-&gt;add_timer".

Move list_del(&amp;amp;entry-&gt;list) to mptcp_pm_del_add_timer and inside the pm lock,
do not directly access any members of the entry outside the pm lock, which
can avoid similar "entry-&gt;x" uaf.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46859 | platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accesses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46859</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

values of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking that the SINF array
is big enough.

Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries, for example
the Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it only
supports the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.

Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which covers all AC+DC
brightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.

For higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF array
does not contain an entry for that attribute, avoiding show()/store()
accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds checking to the probe()
and resume() code accessing these.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46860 | wifi: mt76: mt7921: fix NULL pointer access in mt7921_ipv6_addr_change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46860</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/hyperv: fix kexec crash due to VP assist page corruption

commit 9636be85cc5b ("x86/hyperv: Fix hyperv_pcpu_input_arg handling when
CPUs go online/offline") introduces a new cpuhp state for hyperv
initialization.

cpuhp_setup_state() returns the state number if state is
CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN or CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN and 0 for all other states.
For the hyperv case, since a new cpuhp state was introduced it would
return 0. However, in hv_machine_shutdown(), the cpuhp_remove_state() call
is conditioned upon "hyperv_init_cpuhp &gt; 0". This will never be true and
so hv_cpu_die() won't be called on all CPUs. This means the VP assist page
won't be reset. When the kexec kernel tries to setup the VP assist page
again, the hypervisor corrupts the memory region of the old VP assist page
causing a panic in case the kexec kernel is using that memory elsewhere.
This was originally fixed in commit dfe94d4086e4 ("x86/hyperv: Fix kexec
panic/hang issues").

Get rid of hyperv_init_cpuhp entirely since we are no longer using a
dynamic cpuhp state and use CPUHP_AP_HYPERV_ONLINE directly with
cpuhp_remove_state().</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46865 | fou: fix initialization of grc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/client: fix deadlock in show_meminfo()

There is a real deadlock as well as sleeping in atomic() bug in here, if
the bo put happens to be the last ref, since bo destruction wants to
grab the same spinlock and sleeping locks.  Fix that by dropping the ref
using xe_bo_put_deferred(), and moving the final commit outside of the
lock. Dropping the lock around the put is tricky since the bo can go
out of scope and delete itself from the list, making it difficult to
navigate to the next list entry.

(cherry picked from commit 0083b8e6f11d7662283a267d4ce7c966812ffd8a)</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46868 | firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46868</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()

If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in the original code, we would
hold onto the lock.  That means that if we tried to set it later, then
it would cause a deadlock.  Drop the lock on the error path.  That's
what all the callers are expecting.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:05:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9281 | bg5sbk MiniCMS post-edit.php cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9281</link><description>A vulnerability was found in bg5sbk MiniCMS up to 1.11 and classified as problematic.

However, there is the possibility to request a single dataset, which should be subject to the same filtering process, but currently is missing the correct filtering.


This enables parties to potentially see datasets they should not have access to, thereby exposing sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability requires knowing the ID of a restricted dataset, but some IDs may be guessed by trying out many IDs in an automated way.

Due to the service binding to `*:631 ( INADDR_ANY )`, multiple bugs in `cups-browsed` can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:30:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45986 | A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Projectworld Online Voting System 1.0 that occurs when an account is reg...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45986</link><description>A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Projectworld Online Voting System 1.0 that occurs when an account is registered with a malicious javascript payload.

Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version &lt; `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:28:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47179 | RSSHub&amp;#x27;s `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47179</link><description>RSSHub is an RSS network. Prior to commit 64e00e7, RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning, which could have lead to a full repository takeover. Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow. As of commit 64e00e7, this scenario has been addressed and the RSSHub repository is no longer vulnerable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 19:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8118 | Grafana alerting wrong permission on datasource rule write endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8118</link><description>In Grafana, the wrong permission is applied to the alert rule write API endpoint, allowing users with permission to write external alert instances to also write alert rules.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:49:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45984 | A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject ma...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45984</link><description>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in add_donor.php of Blood Bank And Donation Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when the Donor List is viewed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 18:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45987 | Projectworld Online Voting System Version 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via voter.php.

Starting in version 1.11 and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `fetchurl.nix&gt;` did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `fetchurl.nix&gt;` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature. Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `&lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;` work in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix 2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39577 | Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements use...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39577</link><description>Dell SmartFabric OS10 Software, versions 10.5.6.x, 10.5.5.x, 10.5.4.x, 10.5.3.x, contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability.

Prior to version 1.3.0, given a number of preconditions, the `highest_available` setting will incorrectly assume that the identity’s highest available AAL is `aal1` even though it really is `aal2`. This means that the `highest_available` configuration will act as if the user has only one factor set up, for that particular user. This means that they can call the settings and whoami endpoint without a `aal2` session, even though that should be disallowed. An attacker would need to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user who has only OTP for login enabled and who has an incorrect `available_aal` value stored, to exploit this vulnerability. All other aspects of the session (e.g. the session’s aal) are not impacted by this issue. On the Ory Network, only 0.00066% of registered users were affected by this issue, and most of those users appeared to be test users. Their respective AAL values have since been updated and they are no longer vulnerable to this attack. Version 1.3.0 is not affected by this issue. As a workaround, those who require MFA should disable the passwordless code login method. If that is not possible, check the sessions `aal` to identify if the user has `aal1` or `aal2`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 17:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45374 | goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin Weak Password Requirements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45374</link><description>In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are

This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.

Archetype integration testing creates a file
called ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml
This file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,
which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains
credentials.

When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of
the final artifact.

If a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release
or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 08:31:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8861 | ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities &amp;lt;= 5.9.3.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8861</link><description>The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.3.2 due to incorrect use of the wp_kses_allowed_html function, which allows the 'onclick' attribute for certain HTML elements without sufficient restriction or context validation.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information, specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication, may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system, consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk, in monitoring systems, or in logging services.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 21:27:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51157 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive inform...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51157</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in ZKTeco WDMS v.5.1.3 Pro allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the Emp Name parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 19:15:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46488 | sqlite-vec v0.1.1 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow via the npy_token_next function.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:45:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20508 | Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine Software for Cisco IOS XE Software Security Policy Bypass and Denial of Service Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20508</link><description>A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured security policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests when they are processed by Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process.  If the action in case of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to the default, fail-open, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass configured security policies. If the action in case of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to fail-close, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause traffic that is configured to be inspected by Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine to be dropped.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:45:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-44825 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in Centro de Tecnologia da Informaco Renato Archer InVesalius3 v3.1.99995 allows attackers to write arbitr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-44825</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in Centro de Tecnologia da Informaco Renato Archer InVesalius3 v3.1.99995 allows attackers to write arbitrary files unto the system via a crafted .inv3 file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:20:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46485 | dingfanzu CMS 1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=addCate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46485</link><description>dingfanzu CMS 1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=addCate</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:20:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46600 | dingfanzu CMS 1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=delCate&amp;id=31</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46600</link><description>dingfanzu CMS 1.0 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/doAdminAction.php?act=delCate&amp;amp;id=31</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 16:20:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-25189 | BTS is affected by information disclosure vulnerability where mobile network operator personnel connected over BTS Web Element Manager, rega...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25189</link><description>BTS is affected by information disclosure vulnerability where mobile network operator personnel connected over BTS Web Element Manager, regardless of the access privileges, having a possibility to read BTS service operation details performed by Nokia Care service personnel via SSH.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:55:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47078 | Meshtastic firmware Authentication/Authorization Bypass via MQTT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47078</link><description>Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network.

error conditions are reported in a status register.  Furthermore, the OS
can opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.

It is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,
which generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.

This case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion
itself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only
generate an interrupt when a new status bit becomes set.

However, the lock protecting this state in Xen will try to be taken
recursively, and deadlock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9169 | litespeed cache &amp;lt;= 6.4.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9169</link><description>The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin debug settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
