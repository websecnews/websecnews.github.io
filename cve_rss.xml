This issue affects Apache Axis: through 1.3.

As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release 
fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards
 this are welcome.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 12:28:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6798 | The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy – Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News &amp; YouTube Video Feeds Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unaut...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6798</link><description>The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy – Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News &amp; YouTube Video Feeds Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized settings update due to a missing capability check when updating settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.2.

quarantine domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width
of DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48) and hence 4 page table levels.

However dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables
levels based on the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on
systems with no RAM above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are
configured in the IOMMU.

On systems without RAM above the 512GB boundary
amd_iommu_quarantine_init() will setup page tables for the scratch
page with 4 levels, while the IOMMU will be configured to use 3 levels
only, resulting in the last page table directory (PDE) effectively
becoming a page table entry (PTE), and hence a device in quarantine
mode gaining write access to the page destined to be a PDE.

Due to this page table level mismatch, the sink page the device gets
read/write access to is no longer cleared between device assignment,
possibly leading to data leaks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:44:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46836 | x86: BTC/SRSO fixes not fully effective</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46836</link><description>The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative
Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe.  It was believed that the
mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.

However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left
interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one
conditionally on whether XPTI was active.

As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations
are not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race
condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections
and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:44:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46837 | arm32: The cache may not be properly cleaned/invalidated (take two)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46837</link><description>Arm provides multiple helpers to clean &amp; invalidate the cache
for a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocating
guest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing)
have reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.

Unfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would
then result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore there
is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.

This undefined behavior was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the
approach was not sufficient.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:44:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34323 | xenstored: A transaction conflict can crash C Xenstored</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34323</link><description>When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check

be possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has
been removed outside of the transaction.

Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that the
quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it.  This

This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated
Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an
unprivileged guest.

The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a
paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause console
messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of
triggering the deadlock is not neglectable.

Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel
on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the
issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get
the lock).</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:44:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34325 | Multiple vulnerabilities in libfsimage disk handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34325</link><description>[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the
text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]

libfsimage contains parsing code for several filesystems, most of them based on
grub-legacy code.  libfsimage is used by pygrub to inspect guest disks.

Pygrub runs as the same user as the toolstack (root in a priviledged domain).

At least one issue has been reported to the Xen Security Team that allows an
attacker to trigger a stack buffer overflow in libfsimage.  After further
analisys the Xen Security Team is no longer confident in the suitability of
libfsimage when run against guest controlled input with super user priviledges.

In order to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches are
provided in the resolution section of the advisory that allow running pygrub in
deprivileged mode.

CVE-2023-4949 refers to the original issue in the upstream grub
project ("An attacker with local access to a system (either through a
disk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition to
grub-legacy in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grub’s XFS
file system implementation.")  CVE-2023-34325 refers specifically to
the vulnerabilities in Xen's copy of libfsimage, which is decended
from a very old version of grub.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:44:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34326 | x86/AMD: missing IOMMU TLB flushing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34326</link><description>The caching invalidation guidelines from the AMD-Vi specification (48882—Rev

is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:31:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34322 | top-level shadow reference dropped too early for 64-bit PV guests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34322</link><description>For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see
XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itself
needs to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run
directly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this
means running on the shadow of the guest root page table.

In the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool
associated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This
tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in
question is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to
supposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,
the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:31:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-39294 | QTS, QuTS hero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39294</link><description>An OS command injection vulnerability has been reported to affect several QNAP operating system versions.

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-51491 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 02:10:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41782 | DLL Hijacking Vulnerability in ZTE ZXCLOUD iRAI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41782</link><description>There is a DLL hijacking vulnerability in ZTE ZXCLOUD iRAI, an attacker could place a fake DLL file in a specific directory and successfully exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 02:10:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7207 | Debian's cpio contains a path traversal vulnerability.
