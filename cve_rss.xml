```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup

url = "https://example.com"
loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
    url=url, max_depth=2, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
)
docs = loader.load()
```

An attacker in control of the contents of `https://example.com` could place a malicious HTML file in there with links like "https://example.completely.different/my_file.html" and the crawler would proceed to download that file as well even though `prevent_outside=True`.

PCI/ASPM: Fix deadlock when enabling ASPM

A last minute revert in 6.7-final introduced a potential deadlock when
enabling ASPM during probe of Qualcomm PCIe controllers as reported by
lockdep:

  ============================================
  WARNING: possible recursive locking detected

The deadlock can easily be reproduced on machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad
X13s by adding a delay to increase the race window during asynchronous
probe where another thread can take a write lock.

Add a new pci_set_power_state_locked() and associated helper functions that
can be called with the PCI bus semaphore held to avoid taking the read lock
twice.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 15:22:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26600 | phy: ti: phy-omap-usb2: Fix NULL pointer dereference for SRP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26600</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If the external phy working together with phy-omap-usb2 does not implement
send_srp(), we may still attempt to call it. This can happen on an idle
Ethernet gadget triggering a wakeup for example:

Let's fix the issue by checking for send_srp() and set_vbus() before
calling them.

ext4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay

This mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd ("ext4: remove redundant
mb_regenerate_buddy()") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based on
code in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as free
blocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the
buddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 15:10:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26602 | sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26602</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier

On some systems, sys_membarrier can be very expensive, causing overall
slowdowns for everything.  So put a lock on the path in order to
serialize the accesses to prevent the ability for this to be called at
too high of a frequency and saturate the machine.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 15:10:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26603 | x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26603</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer

Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw-&gt;xstate_size. fx_sw-&gt;xstate_size can be changed
from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:

 * fx_sw-&gt;xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
   fx_sw-&gt;xfeatures.
 * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of
   the buffer required by xrstor is accessible.

In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
fx_sw-&gt;xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and
tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.

Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken
from fpstate-&gt;user_size).

iommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region

When the bootloader/firmware doesn't setup the framebuffers, their
address and size are 0 in "iommu-addresses" property. If IOVA region is
reserved with 0 length, then it ends up corrupting the IOVA rbtree with
an entry which has pfn_hi &lt; pfn_lo.
If we intend to use display driver in kernel without framebuffer then
it's causing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as entire valid IOVA
space is reserved when address and length are passed as 0.
An ideal solution would be firmware removing the "iommu-addresses"
property and corresponding "memory-region" if display is not present.
But the kernel should be able to handle this by checking for size of
IOVA region and skipping the IOVA reservation if size is 0. Also, add
a warning if firmware is requesting 0-length IOVA region reservation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52456 | serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52456</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock

When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.

imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to
WAIT_AFTER_SEND.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52457 | serial: 8250: omap: Don&amp;#x27;t skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52457</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed

Returning an error code from .remove() makes the driver core emit the
little helpful error message:

	remove callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored.

and then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freed
are leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the
potential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.

So replace the error return (and with it the little helpful error
message) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52458 | block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52458</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size

Before calling add partition or resize partition, there is no check
on whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.
If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,
then the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,
and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,
resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller than
the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also
result in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52459 | media: v4l: async: Fix duplicated list deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52459</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access

Enabling -Wstringop-overflow globally exposes a warning for a common bug
in the usage of strncat():

  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c: In function 'thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr':
  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c:1136:17: error: 'strncat' specified bound 1024 equals destination size [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
   1136 |                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
        |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ...
   1145 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
   ...
   1150 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);

   ...

Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the
way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer
as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The
result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.

Change it to strlcat().

net: dsa: fix netdev_priv() dereference before check on non-DSA netdevice events

After the blamed commit, we started doing this dereference for every
NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER and NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event in the system.

static inline struct dsa_port *dsa_user_to_port(const struct net_device *dev)
{
	struct dsa_user_priv *p = netdev_priv(dev);

	return p-&gt;dp;
}

Which is obviously bogus, because not all net_devices have a netdev_priv()
of type struct dsa_user_priv. But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small,
and p-&gt;dp means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most
drivers allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not
fault, and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't
caught.

But the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls
alloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv() dereference
is invalid, and we get this when we emit a NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event
with a VLAN as its new upper:

$ ip link add dummy1 type dummy
$ ip link add link dummy1 name dummy1.100 type vlan id 100

There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation

as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq

Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq

Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:29:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24817 | User can see invitees in events created in PMs and private categories</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24817</link><description>Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic on the open-source discussion platform Discourse.

apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty

When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

 "profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}"

a string ":samba-dcerpcd" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
passed to aa_splitn_fqname().

aa_splitn_fqname() treats ":samba-dcerpcd" as only containing a namespace.
Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment "a ns name without a following profile is allowed"
inside.

AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked "name" to be in form like
":samba-dcerpcd" - it is passed from userspace.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with
EPROTO and an explaining message.

f2fs: fix to avoid dirent corruption

As Al reported in link[1]:

f2fs_rename()
...
	if (old_dir != new_dir &amp;&amp; !whiteout)
		f2fs_set_link(old_inode, old_dir_entry,
					old_dir_page, new_dir);
	else
		f2fs_put_page(old_dir_page, 0);

You want correct inumber in the ".." link.  And cross-directory
rename does move the source to new parent, even if you'd been asked
to leave a whiteout in the old place.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231017055040.GN800259@ZenIV/

With below testcase, it may cause dirent corruption, due to it missed
to call f2fs_set_link() to update ".." link to new directory.
- mkdir -p dir/foo
- renameat2 -w dir/foo bar

bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary

When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map
may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.
However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
ops-&gt;map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a
RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops-&gt;map_free completes,
the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
use-after-free problem.

Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both
one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner
map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is
accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when
releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head
field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to
reduce the size of bpf_map.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:29:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52448 | gfs2: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_rgrp_dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52448</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],

In the normal case, obtain gluebi-&gt;desc in the gluebi_get_device(),
and access gluebi-&gt;desc in the gluebi_read(). However,
gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the
ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.

The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI
volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].
Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from
creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the
type MTD_UBIVOLUME.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:29:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52450 | perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix NULL pointer dereference issue in upi_fill_topology()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52450</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots

Privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack
memory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses
were permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted
above state-&gt;allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the
stack was already "large enough", the access was permitted, but
otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to "grow the
stack". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:
- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()
- in check_stack_range_initialized()
This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests
that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were
changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior
persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it
can't run unprivileged for other reasons.

This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset
reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one
because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack
using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers
with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the
function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program
to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime
because a too small stack had been allocated for it.

Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in
bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by
update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()
was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed
part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was
incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used
instead.

This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in
grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to
check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is
now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.
check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been
allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.

A few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The
one that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:29:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26586 | mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26586</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS

For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.

The following prog is accepted:

This prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8

erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format

EROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each
per-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk
superblock for initialization.

However, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use
an unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA
algorithmtype even it's not set in `sbi-&gt;available_compr_algs`.  This
can lead to an unexpected "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference" if
the corresponding decompressor isn't built-in.

Fix this by checking against `sbi-&gt;available_compr_algs` for each
m_algorithmformat request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset
