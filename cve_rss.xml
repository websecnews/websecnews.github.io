Versions prior to 2.1.0 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that enables users to force DragonFly2’s components to make requests to internal services that are otherwise not accessible to them. The issue arises because the Manager API accepts a user-supplied URL when creating a Preheat job with weak validation, peers can trigger other peers to fetch an arbitrary URL through pieceManager.DownloadSource, and internal HTTP clients follow redirects, allowing a request to a malicious server to be redirected to internal services. This can be used to probe or access internal HTTP endpoints. The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 19:28:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59345 | Dragonfly did not enable authentication for some Manager’s endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59345</link><description>Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system. Prior to 2.1.0, The /api/v1/jobs and /preheats endpoints in Manager web UI are accessible without authentication. Any user with network access to the Manager can create, delete, and modify jobs, and create preheat jobs. An unauthenticated adversary with network access to a Manager web UI uses /api/v1/jobs endpoint to create hundreds of useless jobs. The Manager is in a denial-of-service state, and stops accepting requests from valid administrators. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 19:18:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10613 | itsourcecode Student Information System leveledit1.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10613</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in itsourcecode Student Information System 1.0.

Prior to 3.19.0 and 4.1.0, A client-side path traversal vulnerability in Nuxt's Island payload revival mechanism allowed attackers to manipulate client-side requests to different endpoints within the same application domain when specific prerendering conditions are met. The vulnerability occurs in the client-side payload revival process (revive-payload.client.ts) where Nuxt Islands are automatically fetched when encountering serialized __nuxt_island objects. During prerendering, if an API endpoint returns user-controlled data containing a crafted __nuxt_island object, he data gets serialized with devalue.stringify and stored in the prerendered page. When a client navigates to the prerendered page, devalue.parse deserializes the payload. The Island reviver attempts to fetch /__nuxt_island/${key}.json where key could contain path traversal sequences. Update to Nuxt 3.19.0+ or 4.1.0+.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:50:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10608 | Portabilis i-Educar enrollment-history access control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10608</link><description>A vulnerability was detected in Portabilis i-Educar up to 2.10.

staging: vt6655: fix some erroneous memory clean-up loops

In some initialization functions of this driver, memory is allocated with
'i' acting as an index variable and increasing from 0. The commit in
"Fixes" introduces some clean-up codes in case of allocation failure,
which free memory in reverse order with 'i' decreasing to 0. However,
there are some problems:
  - The case i=0 is left out. Thus memory is leaked.
  - In case memory allocation fails right from the start, the memory
    freeing loops will start with i=-1 and invalid memory locations will
    be accessed.

One of these loops has been fixed in commit c8ff91535880 ("staging:
vt6655: fix potential memory leak"). Fix the remaining erroneous loops.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50356 | net: sched: sfb: fix null pointer access issue when sfb_init() fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50356</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: fix aux-bus EP lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP aux-bus, an attempt to populate the bus a second time will
simply fail ("DP AUX EP device already populated").

Fix this by tying the lifetime of the EP device to the DRM device rather
than DP controller platform device.

This occurs because the transmission timed out, and that's due
to data race. Each thread rewrite channels's descriptor as soon as
device_issue_pending is called. It leads to the situation that
the driver thinks that it uses the right descriptor in interrupt
handler while channels's descriptor has been changed by other
thread. The descriptor which in fact reported interrupt will not
be handled any more, as well as its tx-&gt;callback.
That's why timeout reports.

With current fixes channels' descriptor changes it's value only
when it has been used. A new descriptor is acquired from
vc-&gt;desc_issued queue that is already filled with descriptors
that are ready to be sent. Threads have no direct access to DMA
channel descriptor. In case of channel's descriptor is busy, try
to submit to HW again when a descriptor is completed. In this case,
vc-&gt;desc_issued may be empty when hisi_dma_start_transfer is called,
so delete error reporting on this. Now it is just possible to queue
a descriptor for further processing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50363 | skmsg: pass gfp argument to alloc_sk_msg()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50363</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: designware: Fix handling of real but unexpected device interrupts

Commit c7b79a752871 ("mfd: intel-lpss: Add Intel Alder Lake PCH-S PCI
IDs") caused a regression on certain Gigabyte motherboards for Intel
Alder Lake-S where system crashes to NULL pointer dereference in
i2c_dw_xfer_msg() when system resumes from S3 sleep state ("deep").

I was able to debug the issue on Gigabyte Z690 AORUS ELITE and made
following notes:

- Issue happens when resuming from S3 but not when resuming from
  "s2idle"
- PCI device 00:15.0 == i2c_designware.0 is already in D0 state when
  system enters into pci_pm_resume_noirq() while all other i2c_designware
  PCI devices are in D3. Devices were runtime suspended and in D3 prior
  entering into suspend
- Interrupt comes after pci_pm_resume_noirq() when device interrupts are
  re-enabled
- According to register dump the interrupt really comes from the
  i2c_designware.0. Controller is enabled, I2C target address register
  points to a one detectable I2C device address 0x60 and the
  DW_IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register START_DET, STOP_DET, ACTIVITY and
  TX_EMPTY bits are set indicating completed I2C transaction.

My guess is that the firmware uses this controller to communicate with
an on-board I2C device during resume but does not disable the controller
before giving control to an operating system.

I was told the UEFI update fixes this but never the less it revealed the
driver is not ready to handle TX_EMPTY (or RX_FULL) interrupt when device
is supposed to be idle and state variables are not set (especially the
dev-&gt;msgs pointer which may point to NULL or stale old data).

Introduce a new software status flag STATUS_ACTIVE indicating when the
controller is active in driver point of view. Now treat all interrupts
that occur when is not set as unexpected and mask all interrupts from
the controller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50371 | led: qcom-lpg: Fix sleeping in atomic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50371</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

I reproduced this warning with dlm_locktorture test which is currently
not upstream. However this patch fix the issue by make a additional
refcount between dlm_lowcomms_new_msg() and dlm_lowcomms_commit_msg().
In case of the race the kref_put() in dlm_lowcomms_commit_msg() will be
the final put.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50374 | Bluetooth: hci_{ldisc,serdev}: check percpu_init_rwsem() failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50374</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When ipu_bridge_parse_rotation() and ipu_bridge_parse_orientation() run

So if either of the dev_warn() calls about unknown values are hit this
will lead to a NULL pointer deref.

Set sensor-&gt;adev earlier, with a borrowed ref to avoid making unrolling

nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.

After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
be called for buffer heads without the "uptodate" flag and causes the
warning.

Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.

This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53338 | lwt: Fix return values of BPF xmit ops</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53338</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lwt: Fix return values of BPF xmit ops

BPF encap ops can return different types of positive values, such like
NET_RX_DROP, NET_XMIT_CN, NETDEV_TX_BUSY, and so on, from function
skb_do_redirect and bpf_lwt_xmit_reroute. At the xmit hook, such return
values would be treated implicitly as LWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE in
ip(6)_finish_output2. When this happens, skbs that have been freed would
continue to the neighbor subsystem, causing use-after-free bug and
kernel crashes.

To fix the incorrect behavior, skb_do_redirect return values can be
simply discarded, the same as tc-egress behavior. On the other hand,
bpf_lwt_xmit_reroute returns useful errors to local senders, e.g. PMTU
information. Thus convert its return values to avoid the conflict with
LWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53339 | btrfs: fix BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53339</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance

Pausing and canceling balance can race to interrupt balance lead to BUG_ON
panic in btrfs_cancel_balance. The BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance
does not take this race scenario into account.

However, the race condition has no other side effects. We can fix that.

net/mlx5: Collect command failures data only for known commands

DEVX can issue a general command, which is not used by mlx5 driver.
In case such command is failed, mlx5 is trying to collect the failure
data, However, mlx5 doesn't create a storage for this command, since
mlx5 doesn't use it. This lead to array-index-out-of-bounds error.

Fix it by checking whether the command is known before collecting the
failure data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53341 | of/fdt: run soc memory setup when early_init_dt_scan_memory fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53341</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If memory has been found early_init_dt_scan_memory now returns 1. If

setup mechanisms to carry on.

Previously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without
distinguishing between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any
code path after the early_init_dt_scan memory call in the ramips
plat_mem_setup code wouldn't be executed anymore. Making
early_init_dt_scan_memory the only way to initialize the memory.

Some boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board, depend on memory
initialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function

icmp6: Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry-&gt;rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().

With some IPv6 Ext Hdr (RPL, SRv6, etc.), we can send a packet that
has the link-local address as src and dst IP and will be forwarded to
an external IP in the IPv6 Ext Hdr.

For example, the script below generates a packet whose src IP is the
link-local address and dst is updated to 11::.

  # for f in $(find /proc/sys/net/ -name *seg6_enabled*); do echo 1 &gt; $f; done
  # python3
  &gt;&gt;&gt; from socket import *
  &gt;&gt;&gt; from scapy.all import *
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR = "fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456"
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; pkt = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR)
  &gt;&gt;&gt; pkt /= IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=4, addresses=["11::", "22::"], segleft=1)
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; sk = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)
  &gt;&gt;&gt; sk.sendto(bytes(pkt), (DST_ADDR, 0))

For such a packet, we call ip6_route_input() to look up a route for the
next destination in these three functions depending on the header type.

  * ipv6_rthdr_rcv()
  * ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv()
  * ipv6_srh_rcv()

If no route is found, ip6_null_entry is set to skb, and the following
dst_input(skb) calls ip6_pkt_drop().

Finally, in icmp6_dev(), we dereference skb_rt6_info(skb)-&gt;rt6i_idev-&gt;dev
as the input device is the loopback interface.  Then, we have to check if
skb_rt6_info(skb)-&gt;rt6i_idev is NULL or not to avoid NULL pointer deref
for ip6_null_entry.

=====================================================

We can follow the call chain and find that 'bcm_tx_setup' function
calls 'memcpy_from_msg' to copy some content to the newly allocated
frame of 'op-&gt;frames'. After that the 'len' field of copied structure
being compared with some constant value (64 or 8). However, if
'memcpy_from_msg' returns an error, we will compare some uninitialized
memory. This triggers 'uninit-value' issue.

This patch will add 'memcpy_from_msg' possible errors processing to
avoid uninit-value issue.

rxrpc: Fix potential data race in rxrpc_wait_to_be_connected()

Inside the loop in rxrpc_wait_to_be_connected() it checks call-&gt;error to
see if it should exit the loop without first checking the call state.  This
is probably safe as if call-&gt;error is set, the call is dead anyway, but we
should probably wait for the call state to have been set to completion
first, lest it cause surprise on the way out.

Fix this by only accessing call-&gt;error if the call is complete.  We don't
actually need to access the error inside the loop as we'll do that after.

This caused the following report:

net/mlx5: Handle pairing of E-switch via uplink un/load APIs

In case user switch a device from switchdev mode to legacy mode, mlx5
first unpair the E-switch and afterwards unload the uplink vport.
From the other hand, in case user remove or reload a device, mlx5
first unload the uplink vport and afterwards unpair the E-switch.

The latter is causing a bug[1], hence, handle pairing of E-switch as
part of uplink un/load APIs.

[1]
In case VF_LAG is used, every tc fdb flow is duplicated to the peer
esw. However, the original esw keeps a pointer to this duplicated
flow, not the peer esw.
e.g.: if user create tc fdb flow over esw0, the flow is duplicated
over esw1, in FW/HW, but in SW, esw0 keeps a pointer to the duplicated
flow.
During module unload while a peer tc fdb flow is still offloaded, in
case the first device to be removed is the peer device (esw1 in the
example above), the peer net-dev is destroyed, and so the mlx5e_priv
is memset to 0.
Afterwards, the peer device is trying to unpair himself from the
original device (esw0 in the example above). Unpair API invoke the
original device to clear peer flow from its eswitch (esw0), but the
peer flow, which is stored over the original eswitch (esw0), is
trying to use the peer mlx5e_priv, which is memset to 0 and result in
bellow kernel-oops.

btrfs: fix deadlock when aborting transaction during relocation with scrub

Before relocating a block group we pause scrub, then do the relocation and
then unpause scrub. The relocation process requires starting and committing
a transaction, and if we have a failure in the critical section of the
transaction commit path (transaction state &gt;= TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START),
we will deadlock if there is a paused scrub.

That results in stack traces like the following:

  [42.479] BTRFS info (device sdc): relocating block group 53876686848 flags metadata|raid6

drm/sched: Check scheduler work queue before calling timeout handling

During an IGT GPU reset test we see again oops despite of
commit 0c8c901aaaebc9 (drm/sched: Check scheduler ready before calling
timeout handling).

It uses ready condition whether to call drm_sched_fault which unwind
the TDR leads to GPU reset.
However it looks the ready condition is overloaded with other meanings,
for example, for the following stack is related GPU reset :

0  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start
1  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_resume
2  gfx_v9_0_cp_resume
3  gfx_v9_0_hw_init
4  gfx_v9_0_resume
5  amdgpu_device_ip_resume_phase2

does the following:
	/* start the ring */
	gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start(adev);
	ring-&gt;sched.ready = true;

The same approach is for other ASICs as well :
gfx_v8_0_cp_gfx_resume
gfx_v10_0_kiq_resume, etc...

As a result, our GPU reset test causes GPU fault which calls unconditionally gfx_v9_0_fault
and then drm_sched_fault. However now it depends on whether the interrupt service routine
drm_sched_fault is executed after gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start is completed which sets the ready
field of the scheduler to true even  for uninitialized schedulers and causes oops vs
no fault or when ISR  drm_sched_fault is completed prior  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start and
NULL pointer dereference does not occur.

Use the field timeout_wq  to prevent oops for uninitialized schedulers.
The field could be initialized by the work queue of resetting the domain.

accel/habanalabs: postpone mem_mgr IDR destruction to hpriv_release()

The memory manager IDR is currently destroyed when user releases the
file descriptor.
However, at this point the user context might be still held, and memory
buffers might be still in use.
Later on, calls to release those buffers will fail due to not finding
their handles in the IDR, leading to a memory leak.
To avoid this leak, split the IDR destruction from the memory manager
fini, and postpone it to hpriv_release() when there is no user context
and no buffers are used.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53354 | skbuff: skb_segment, Call zero copy functions before using skbuff frags</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53354</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

skbuff: skb_segment, Call zero copy functions before using skbuff frags

Commit bf5c25d60861 ("skbuff: in skb_segment, call zerocopy functions
once per nskb") added the call to zero copy functions in skb_segment().
The change introduced a bug in skb_segment() because skb_orphan_frags()
may possibly change the number of fragments or allocate new fragments
altogether leaving nrfrags and frag to point to the old values. This can
cause a panic with stacktrace like the one below.

In this case calling skb_orphan_frags() updated nr_frags leaving nrfrags
local variable in skb_segment() stale. This resulted in the code hitting

list_skb pointer, which was NULL, and caused kernel panic. Move the call
to zero copy functions before using frags and nr_frags.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53355 | staging: pi433: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53355</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

once.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53360 | NFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53360</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)

I found that the read code might send multiple requests using the same
nfs_pgio_header, but nfs4_proc_read_setup() is only called once. This is
how we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but also
means we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratch
buffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copy
something to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUS
hole segments.

I fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. I
provide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies,
and free the scratch buffer when the nfs_pgio_header is freed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53361 | LoongArch: mm: Add p?d_leaf() definitions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53361</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Changes in VFIO caused a pseudo-device to be created as child of
fsl-mc devices causing a crash [1] when trying to bind a fsl-mc
device to VFIO. Fix this by checking the device type when enumerating
fsl-mc child devices.

The stack trace is a bit misleading as dw_pcie_host_deinit() doesn't
directly call pci_bus_release_domain_nr(). The issue turns out to be in
pci_remove_root_bus() which first calls pci_remove_bus() which frees the
struct pci_bus when its struct device is released. Then
pci_bus_release_domain_nr() is called and accesses the freed struct
pci_bus. Reordering these fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53364 | regulator: da9063: better fix null deref with partial DT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53364</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: da9063: better fix null deref with partial DT

Two versions of the original patch were sent but V1 was merged instead
of V2 due to a mistake.

So update to V2.

The advantage of V2 is that it completely avoids dereferencing the pointer,
even just to take the address, which may fix problems with some compilers.
Both versions work on my gcc 9.4 but use the safer one.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53365 | ip6mr: Fix skb_under_panic in ip6mr_cache_report()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53365</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

which is due to bio-&gt;bi_bdev being NULL. This can happen if we have two
tasks doing polled IO, and task B ends up completing IO from task A if
they are sharing a poll queue. If task B completes the IO and puts the
bio into our cache, then it can allocate that bio again before task A
is done polling for it. As that would necessitate a preempt between the
two tasks, it's enough to just be a bit more careful in checking for
whether or not bio-&gt;bi_bdev is NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53367 | accel/habanalabs: fix mem leak in capture user mappings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53367</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

          != buffer)) { // 3. This check passed due to 'cpu_buffer-&gt;buffer'

  ring_buffer_unlock_commit()
    [...]
    cpu_buffer = buffer-&gt;buffers[cpu]; // 5. Now find 'cpu_buffer_b' !!!
    rb_commit(cpu_buffer)
      rb_end_commit()  // 6. WARN for the wrong 'committing' state !!!

Based on above analysis, we can easily reproduce by following testcase:
  ``` bash
  #!/bin/bash

  dmesg -n 7
  sysctl -w kernel.panic_on_warn=1
  TR=/sys/kernel/tracing
  echo 7 &gt; ${TR}/buffer_size_kb
  echo "sched:sched_switch" &gt; ${TR}/set_event
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 &gt; ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &amp;
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 &gt; ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &amp;
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 &gt; ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &amp;
  ```

To fix it, IIUC, we can use smp_call_function_single() to do the swap on
the target cpu where the buffer is located, so that above race would be
avoided.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10205 | Predictable Salt and Weak Hashing Algorithm</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10205</link><description>Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt vulnerability in ABB FLXEON.This issue affects FLXEON: through 9.3.5. and newer versions</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:16:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48842 | Hardcoded passwords</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48842</link><description>Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability in ABB FLXEON.This issue affects FLXEON: through 9.3.5 and newer versions</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:55:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54390 | A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the ResetPasswordRequest operation of Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) when the zimbra...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54390</link><description>A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the ResetPasswordRequest operation of Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) when the zimbraFeatureResetPasswordStatus attribute is enabled.

Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:54:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58174 | LAM profile editor stored cross-site scripting vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58174</link><description>LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory.

Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize without prior validation or authentication, allowing a local process at the same integrity level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, and only afterward checks whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after deserialization, any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window can achieve in-process code execution, which may aid evasion of application control policies by running payloads within the trusted, signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:44:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50339 | Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50339</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()

syzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work
at mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from
mgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can
race with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from
hci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().

Since mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can
safely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and
hci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag
after INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.

This is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization
via hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere
else. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future
patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50340 | media: vimc: Fix wrong function called when vimc_init() fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50340</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because in scatterwalk_copychunks(), we attempted to write to
a buffer (@sign) that was allocated in the stack (vmalloc area) by
crypt_message() and thus accessing its remaining 8 (x2) bytes ended up
crossing a page boundary.

To simply fix it, we could just pass @sign kmalloc'd from
crypt_message() and then we're done.  Luckily, we don't seem to pass
any other vmalloc'd buffers in smb_rqst::rq_iov...

Instead, let's map the correct pages and offsets from vmalloc buffers
as well in cifs_sg_set_buf() and then avoiding such oopses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50342 | floppy: Fix memory leak in do_floppy_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50342</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If the floppy_alloc_disk() failed, disks of current drive will not be set,
thus the lastest allocated set-&gt;tag cannot be freed in the error handling
path. A simple call graph shown as below:

 floppy_module_init()
   floppy_init()
     do_floppy_init()
       for (drive = 0; drive &lt; N_DRIVE; drive++)
         blk_mq_alloc_tag_set()
           blk_mq_alloc_tag_set_tags()
             blk_mq_realloc_tag_set_tags() # set-&gt;tag allocated
         floppy_alloc_disk()
           blk_mq_alloc_disk() # error occurred, disks failed to allocated

       -&gt;out_put_disk:
       for (drive = 0; drive &lt; N_DRIVE; drive++)
         if (!disks[drive][0]) # the last disks is not set and loop break
           break;
         blk_mq_free_tag_set() # the latest allocated set-&gt;tag leaked

Fix this problem by free the set-&gt;tag of current drive before jump to
error handling path.

rapidio: fix possible name leaks when rio_add_device() fails

Patch series "rapidio: fix three possible memory leaks".

This patchset fixes three name leaks in error handling.
 - patch #1 fixes two name leaks while rio_add_device() fails.
 - patch #2 fixes a name leak while  rio_register_mport() fails.


This patch (of 2):

If rio_add_device() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name()
need be freed.  It should use put_device() to give up the reference in the
error path, so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(), and the
'rdev' can be freed in rio_release_dev().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50344 | ext4: fix null-ptr-deref in ext4_write_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50344</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Protect against send buffer overflow in NFSv3 READ

Since before the git era, NFSD has conserved the number of pages
held by each nfsd thread by combining the RPC receive and send
buffers into a single array of pages. This works because there are
no cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a
large RPC Reply at the same time.

Once an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates
svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be
used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer
(rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC
Call is large.

A client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly-
formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is
excessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be
constructed in that case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50346 | ext4: init quota for &amp;#x27;old.inode&amp;#x27; in &amp;#x27;ext4_rename&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50346</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread

In case a malicious initiator sends some random data immediately after a
login PDU; the iscsi_target_sk_data_ready() callback will schedule the
login_work and, at the same time, the negotiation may end without clearing
the LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag (because no additional PDU exchanges are
required to complete the login).

The login has been completed but the login_work function will find the
LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag set and will never stop from rescheduling
itself; at this point, if the initiator drops the connection, the
iscsit_conn structure will be freed, login_work will dereference a released
socket structure and the kernel crashes.

Second bug is the use of rbe_prev vs. prev pointer.
If rbe_prev() returns NULL after at least one iteration, rbe_prev points
to element that is not an end interval, hence it should not be removed.

Lastly, check the genmask of the end interval if this is active in the

rbd: avoid use-after-free in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails

If getting an ID or setting up a work queue in rbd_dev_create() fails,
use-after-free on rbd_dev-&gt;rbd_client, rbd_dev-&gt;spec and rbd_dev-&gt;opts
is triggered in do_rbd_add().  The root cause is that the ownership of
these structures is transfered to rbd_dev prematurely and they all end
up getting freed when rbd_dev_create() calls rbd_dev_free() prior to
returning to do_rbd_add().

net: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()

In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as
pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an
error early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the
error value and continues removing the device. This results in a
resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a
callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already
gone which probably results in a crash.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53309 | drm/radeon: Fix integer overflow in radeon_cs_parser_init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53309</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race

fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info-&gt;bat,
which gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:

  info-&gt;bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &amp;amp;fuel_gauge_desc, &amp;amp;psy_cfg);

As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
where fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while
info-&gt;bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
the power_supply which will eventually get stored in info-&gt;bat,
so fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
the passed in psy argument which is always valid.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53311 | nilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53311</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput

During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,
nilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if
inodes are left in "garbage_list" and released by nilfs_dispose_list at
the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was fixed by commit
9b5a04ac3ad9 ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in
nilfs_evict_inode()").

However, it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the
call path where mark_inode_dirty_sync() is called from iput():

nilfs_detach_log_writer()
  nilfs_dispose_list()
    iput()
      mark_inode_dirty_sync()
        __mark_inode_dirty()
          nilfs_dirty_inode()
            __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()
              nilfs_load_inode_block() --&gt; causes UAF of nilfs_root struct

This can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef ("vfs: add support for a
lazytime mount option"), which changed iput() to call
mark_inode_dirty_sync() on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME
flag and i_nlink is non-zero.

This issue appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 ("nilfs2: do not write dirty
data after degenerating to read-only") when using the syzbot reproducer,
but the issue has potentially existed before.

Fix this issue by adding a "purging flag" to the nilfs structure, setting
that flag while disposing the "garbage_list" and checking it in
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().

Unlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root
in nilfs_evict_inode()"), this patch does not rely on ns_writer to
determine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on
mount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of
salvaged data before attaching the log writer, so changing
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer is NULL
will cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only
flag is to allow for narrowing of such conditions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53312 | net: fix net_dev_start_xmit trace event vs skb_transport_offset()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53312</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Fix SKB corruption in REO destination ring

While running traffics for a long time, randomly an RX descriptor
filled with value "0" from REO destination ring is received.
This descriptor which is invalid causes the wrong SKB (SKB stored in
the IDR lookup with buffer id "0") to be fetched which in turn
causes SKB memory corruption issue and the same leads to crash
after some time.

Changed the start id for idr allocation to "1" and the buffer id "0"
is reserved for error validation. Introduced Sanity check to validate
the descriptor, before processing the SKB.

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix issues in mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info()

The function mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info() has four issues:

1) It calculates valid entry length in alltgt_info assuming the header part
   of the struct mpi3mr_device_map_info would equal to sizeof(u32).  The
   correct size is sizeof(u64).

2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one
   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.

3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.

4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().
   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the
   alltgt_info size. It causes "BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds".

Fix the issues by using the correct header size, removing the subtraction
from num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying
the correct length to sg_copy_from_buffer().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53321 | wifi: mac80211_hwsim: drop short frames</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53321</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Wait for io return on terminate rport

System crash due to use after free.
Current code allows terminate_rport_io to exit before making
sure all IOs has returned. For FCP-2 device, IO's can hang
on in HW because driver has not tear down the session in FW at
first sign of cable pull. When dev_loss_tmo timer pops,
terminate_rport_io is called and upper layer is about to
free various resources. Terminate_rport_io trigger qla to do
the final cleanup, but the cleanup might not be fast enough where it
leave qla still holding on to the same resource.

Wait for IO's to return to upper layer before resources are freed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53323 | ext2/dax: Fix ext2_setsize when len is page aligned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53323</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext2/dax: Fix ext2_setsize when len is page aligned

PAGE_ALIGN(x) macro gives the next highest value which is multiple of
pagesize. But if x is already page aligned then it simply returns x.
So, if x passed is 0 in dax_zero_range() function, that means the
length gets passed as 0 to -&gt;iomap_begin().

In ext2 it then calls ext2_get_blocks -&gt; max_blocks as 0 and hits bug_on
here in ext2_get_blocks().
	BUG_ON(maxblocks == 0);

Instead we should be calling dax_truncate_page() here which takes
care of it. i.e. it only calls dax_zero_range if the offset is not
page/block aligned.

This can be easily triggered with following on fsdax mounted pmem
device.

dd if=/dev/zero of=file count=1 bs=512

Change logging from drm_{err,info}() to dev_{err,info}() in functions
mtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this will be
essential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind
of error happens during AUX transfers happening before the bridge
is attached.

This may potentially start happening in a later commit implementing
aux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered from the panel
driver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it's

pstore/ram: Check start of empty przs during init

After commit 30696378f68a ("pstore/ram: Do not treat empty buffers as
valid"), initialization would assume a prz was valid after seeing that
the buffer_size is zero (regardless of the buffer start position). This
unchecked start value means it could be outside the bounds of the buffer,
leading to future access panics when written to:

 sysdump_panic_event+0x3b4/0x5b8

 panic+0x1c8/0x42c

 ramoops_pstore_write+0x198/0x1e8

 ...

To avoid this, also check if the prz start is 0 during the initialization
phase. If not, the next prz sanity check case will discover it (start &gt;
size) and zap the buffer back to a sane state.

genirq/ipi: Fix NULL pointer deref in irq_data_get_affinity_mask()

If ipi_send_{mask|single}() is called with an invalid interrupt number, all
the local variables there will be NULL. ipi_send_verify() which is invoked
from these functions does verify its 'data' parameter, resulting in a
kernel oops in irq_data_get_affinity_mask() as the passed NULL pointer gets
dereferenced.

Add a missing NULL pointer check in ipi_send_verify()...

netfilter: conntrack: dccp: copy entire header to stack buffer, not just basic one

Eric Dumazet says:
  nf_conntrack_dccp_packet() has an unique:

  dh = skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff, sizeof(_dh), &amp;_dh);

  And nothing more is 'pulled' from the packet, depending on the content.
  dh-&gt;dccph_doff, and/or dh-&gt;dccph_x ...)
  So dccp_ack_seq() is happily reading stuff past the _dh buffer.

BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in nf_conntrack_dccp_packet+0x1134/0x11c0
Read of size 4 at addr ffff000128f66e0c by task syz-executor.2/29371
[..]

Fix this by increasing the stack buffer to also include room for
the extra sequence numbers and all the known dccp packet type headers,
then pull again after the initial validation of the basic header.

While at it, mark packets invalid that lack 48bit sequence bit but
where RFC says the type MUST use them.

Compile tested only.

v2: first skb_header_pointer() now needs to adjust the size to
    only pull the generic header. (Eric)

Heads-up: I intend to remove dccp conntrack support later this year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53334 | USB: chipidea: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53334</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: chipidea: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()

When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,
otherwise the memory will leak over time.  To make things simpler, just
call debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logic
at once.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43801 | Unchecked input for loop condition vulnerability in XML-RPC in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.111, and older unsupported versions, and L...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43801</link><description>Unchecked input for loop condition vulnerability in XML-RPC in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.111, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4, 7.4 GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions allows remote attackers to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via a crafted XML-RPC request.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:25:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58749 | WAMR runtime hangs or crashes with large memory.fill addresses in LLVM-JIT mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58749</link><description>WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime.

A bit of digging showed that we were invoking the phylink_resume as a part
of the fbnic_up path when we were enabling the service task while not
holding the RTNL lock. We should be enabling this sooner as a part of the
ndo_open path and then just letting the service task come online later.
This will help to enforce the correct locking and brings the phylink
interface online at the same time as the network interface, instead of at a
later time.

I tested this on QEMU to verify this was working by putting the system to
sleep using "echo mem &gt; /sys/power/state" to put the system to sleep in the
guest and then using the command "system_wakeup" in the QEMU monitor.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:37:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39832 | net/mlx5: Fix lockdep assertion on sync reset unload event</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39832</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix lockdep assertion on sync reset unload event

Fix lockdep assertion triggered during sync reset unload event. When the
sync reset flow is initiated using the devlink reload fw_activate
option, the PF already holds the devlink lock while handling unload
event. In this case, delegate sync reset unload event handling back to
the devlink callback process to avoid double-locking and resolve the
lockdep warning.

xfs: do not propagate ENODATA disk errors into xattr code

ENODATA (aka ENOATTR) has a very specific meaning in the xfs xattr code;
namely, that the requested attribute name could not be found.

However, a medium error from disk may also return ENODATA. At best,
this medium error may escape to userspace as "attribute not found"
when in fact it's an IO (disk) error.

At worst, we may oops in xfs_attr_leaf_get() when we do:

	error = xfs_attr_leaf_hasname(args, &amp;amp;bp);
	if (error == -ENOATTR)  {
		xfs_trans_brelse(args-&gt;trans, bp);
		return error;
	}

because an ENODATA/ENOATTR error from disk leaves us with a null bp,
and the xfs_trans_brelse will then null-deref it.

As discussed on the list, we really need to modify the lower level
IO functions to trap all disk errors and ensure that we don't let
unique errors like this leak up into higher xfs functions - many
like this should be remapped to EIO.

However, this patch directly addresses a reported bug in the xattr
code, and should be safe to backport to stable kernels. A larger-scope
patch to handle more unique errors at lower levels can follow later.

(Note, prior to 07120f1abdff we did not oops, but we did return the
wrong error code to userspace.)</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:37:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39836 | efi: stmm: Fix incorrect buffer allocation method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39836</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The warning happens because the PHY is being exited while the netdev

macb_remove().</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39806 | HID: multitouch: fix slab out-of-bounds access in mt_report_fixup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39806</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: multitouch: fix slab out-of-bounds access in mt_report_fixup()

A malicious HID device can trigger a slab out-of-bounds during
mt_report_fixup() by passing in report descriptor smaller than
607 bytes. mt_report_fixup() attempts to patch byte offset 607
of the descriptor with 0x25 by first checking if byte offset
607 is 0x15 however it lacks bounds checks to verify if the
descriptor is big enough before conducting this check. Fix
this bug by ensuring the descriptor size is at least 608
bytes before accessing it.

Below is the KASAN splat after the out of bounds access happens:

bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown

bnxt_set_dflt_rings() assumes that it is always called before any TC has
been created.  So it doesn't take bp-&gt;num_tc into account and assumes
that it is always 0 or 1.

In the FW resource or capability change scenario, the FW will return
flags in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() that will cause the driver to
reinitialize and call bnxt_cancel_reservations().  This will lead to
bnxt_init_dflt_ring_mode() calling bnxt_set_dflt_rings() and bp-&gt;num_tc
may be greater than 1.  This will cause bp-&gt;tx_ring[] to be sized too
small and cause memory corruption in bnxt_alloc_cp_rings().

Fix it by properly scaling the TX rings by bp-&gt;num_tc in the code
paths mentioned above.  Add 2 helper functions to determine
bp-&gt;tx_nr_rings and bp-&gt;tx_nr_rings_per_tc.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39811 | drm/xe/vm: Clear the scratch_pt pointer on error</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39811</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix potential warning in trace_printk_seq during ftrace_dump

When calling ftrace_dump_one() concurrently with reading trace_pipe,
a WARN_ON_ONCE() in trace_printk_seq() can be triggered due to a race
condition.

The issue occurs because:

CPU0 (ftrace_dump)                              CPU1 (reader)
echo z &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger

!trace_empty(&amp;amp;iter)

    ring_buffer_empty_cpu &lt;- all empty
  return NULL

trace_printk_seq(&amp;amp;iter.seq)
  WARN_ON_ONCE(s-&gt;seq.len &gt;= s-&gt;seq.size)

In the context between trace_empty() and trace_find_next_entry_inc()
during ftrace_dump, the ring buffer data was consumed by other readers.
This caused trace_find_next_entry_inc to return NULL, failing to populate
`iter.seq`. At this point, due to the prior trace_iterator_reset, both
`iter.seq.len` and `iter.seq.size` were set to 0. Since they are equal,
the WARN_ON_ONCE condition is triggered.

Move the trace_printk_seq() into the if block that checks to make sure the
return value of trace_find_next_entry_inc() is non-NULL in
ftrace_dump_one(), ensuring the 'iter.seq' is properly populated before
subsequent operations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39814 | ice: fix NULL pointer dereference in ice_unplug_aux_dev() on reset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39814</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/kbuf: always use READ_ONCE() to read ring provided buffer lengths

Since the buffers are mapped from userspace, it is prudent to use
READ_ONCE() to read the value into a local variable, and use that for
any other actions taken. Having a stable read of the buffer length
avoids worrying about it changing after checking, or being read multiple
times.

Similarly, the buffer may well change in between it being picked and
being committed. Ensure the looping for incremental ring buffer commit
stops if it hits a zero sized buffer, as no further progress can be made
at that point.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39817 | efivarfs: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in efivarfs_d_compare</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39817</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/smb: Fix inconsistent refcnt update

A possible inconsistent update of refcount was identified in `smb2_compound_op`.
Such inconsistent update could lead to possible resource leaks.

Why it is a possible bug:
1. In the comment section of the function, it clearly states that the
reference to `cfile` should be dropped after calling this function.
2. Every control flow path would check and drop the reference to
`cfile`, except the patched one.
3. Existing callers would not handle refcount update of `cfile` if
-ENOMEM is returned.

To fix the bug, an extra goto label "out" is added, to make sure that the
cleanup logic would always be respected. As the problem is caused by the
allocation failure of `vars`, the cleanup logic between label "finished"
and "out" can be safely ignored. According to the definition of function
`is_replayable_error`, the error code of "-ENOMEM" is not recoverable.
Therefore, the replay logic also gets ignored.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39820 | drm/msm/dpu: Add a null ptr check for dpu_encoder_needs_modeset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39820</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Avoid undefined behavior from stopping/starting inactive events

Calling pmu-&gt;start()/stop() on perf events in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF can
leave event-&gt;hw.idx at -1. When PMU drivers later attempt to use this
negative index as a shift exponent in bitwise operations, it leads to UBSAN
shift-out-of-bounds reports.

The issue is a logical flaw in how event groups handle throttling when some
members are intentionally disabled. Based on the analysis and the
reproducer provided by Mark Rutland (this issue on both arm64 and x86-64).

The scenario unfolds as follows:

 1. A group leader event is configured with a very aggressive sampling
    period (e.g., sample_period = 1). This causes frequent interrupts and
    triggers the throttling mechanism.
 2. A child event in the same group is created in a disabled state
    (.disabled = 1). This event remains in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF.
    Since it hasn't been scheduled onto the PMU, its event-&gt;hw.idx remains
    initialized at -1.
 3. When throttling occurs, perf_event_throttle_group() and later
    perf_event_unthrottle_group() iterate through all siblings, including
    the disabled child event.
 4. perf_event_throttle()/unthrottle() are called on this inactive child
    event, which then call event-&gt;pmu-&gt;start()/stop().
 5. The PMU driver receives the event with hw.idx == -1 and attempts to
    use it as a shift exponent. e.g., in macros like PMCNTENSET(idx),
    leading to the UBSAN report.

The throttling mechanism attempts to start/stop events that are not
actively scheduled on the hardware.

Move the state check into perf_event_throttle()/perf_event_unthrottle() so
that inactive events are skipped entirely. This ensures only active events
with a valid hw.idx are processed, preventing undefined behavior and
silencing UBSAN warnings. The corrected check ensures true before
proceeding with PMU operations.

The problem can be reproduced with the syzkaller reproducer:</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39822 | io_uring/kbuf: fix signedness in this_len calculation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39822</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: asus: fix UAF via HID_CLAIMED_INPUT validation

After hid_hw_start() is called hidinput_connect() will eventually be
called to set up the device with the input layer since the
HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT connect mask is used. During hidinput_connect()
all input and output reports are processed and corresponding hid_inputs
are allocated and configured via hidinput_configure_usages(). This
process involves slot tagging report fields and configuring usages
by setting relevant bits in the capability bitmaps. However it is possible
that the capability bitmaps are not set at all leading to the subsequent
hidinput_has_been_populated() check to fail leading to the freeing of the
hid_input and the underlying input device.

This becomes problematic because a malicious HID device like a
ASUS ROG N-Key keyboard can trigger the above scenario via a
specially crafted descriptor which then leads to a user-after-free
when the name of the freed input device is written to later on after
hid_hw_start(). Below, report 93 intentionally utilises the
HID_UP_UNDEFINED Usage Page which is skipped during usage
configuration, leading to the frees.

net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

The 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but
lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh
structure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.

For example, when rose_neigh-&gt;use becomes zero during an ioctl operation
via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is
still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.

This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and
updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which
operate reference counts atomically.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39827 | net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39827</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount

Current implementation maintains two separate reference counting
mechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from
rose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracks
references from rose_sock.

This patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' field
for proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing
and decrementing of rose_neigh-&gt;use when rose_neigh-&gt;count is incremented
or decremented.

This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and
rose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects
before freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().

These changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when
all references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.
As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39828 | atm: atmtcp: Prevent arbitrary write in atmtcp_recv_control().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39828</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: atmtcp: Prevent arbitrary write in atmtcp_recv_control().

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

When atmtcp_v_open() or atmtcp_v_close() is called via connect()
or close(), atmtcp_send_control() is called to send an in-kernel
special message.

The message has ATMTCP_HDR_MAGIC in atmtcp_control.hdr.length.
Also, a pointer of struct atm_vcc is set to atmtcp_control.vcc.

The notable thing is struct atmtcp_control is uAPI but has a
space for an in-kernel pointer.

  struct atmtcp_control {
  	struct atmtcp_hdr hdr;	/* must be first */
  ...
  	atm_kptr_t vcc;		/* both directions */
  ...
  } __ATM_API_ALIGN;

  typedef struct { unsigned char _[8]; } __ATM_API_ALIGN atm_kptr_t;

The special message is processed in atmtcp_recv_control() called
from atmtcp_c_send().

atmtcp_c_send() is vcc-&gt;dev-&gt;ops-&gt;send() and called from 2 paths:

  1. .ndo_start_xmit() (vcc-&gt;send() == atm_send_aal0())
  2. vcc_sendmsg()

The problem is sendmsg() does not validate the message length and
userspace can abuse atmtcp_recv_control() to overwrite any kptr
by atmtcp_control.

Let's add a new -&gt;pre_send() hook to validate messages from sendmsg().

trace/fgraph: Fix the warning caused by missing unregister notifier

This warning was triggered during testing on v6.16:

notifier callback ftrace_suspend_notifier_call already registered
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 86 at kernel/notifier.c:23 notifier_chain_register+0x44/0xb0

When writing to the function_profile_enabled interface, the notifier was
not unregistered after start_graph_tracing failed, causing a warning the
next time function_profile_enabled was written.

Fixed by adding unregister_pm_notifier in the exception path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55834 | A Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in JeeWMS v.3.7 and before allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the logControll...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55834</link><description>A Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in JeeWMS v.3.7 and before allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the logController.do component</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7355 | IDOR in Beefull Energy Technologies&amp;#x27; Beefull App</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7355</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Beefull Energy Technologies Beefull App allows Exploitation of Trusted Identifiers.This issue affects Beefull App: before 24.07.2025.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:07:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10290 | Opening links via the contextual menu in Focus iOS for certain URL schemes would fail to load but would not refresh the toolbar correctly, a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10290</link><description>Opening links via the contextual menu in Focus iOS for certain URL schemes would fail to load but would not refresh the toolbar correctly, allowing attackers to spoof websites if users were coerced into opening a link explicitly through a long-press This vulnerability affects Focus for iOS &lt; 143.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10527 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10527</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10528 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10528</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10529 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10529</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10530 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10530</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10531 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10531</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10532 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10532</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10533 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.28, and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10533</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.28, and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10534 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10534</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10535 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10535</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10536 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10536</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143 and Firefox ESR &lt; 140.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:32:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10537 | Memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 140.2, Thunderbird ESR 140.2, Firefox 142 and Thunderbird 142.

Apparently, the reset delays are getting so large they can trigger a

Looking at the code, the current timeout is capped at 5000us.  Using a
base value of 100us, the current code will overflow after (1&lt;&lt;29).  Even
at values before 32, this function wraps around, perhaps
unintentionally.

Cap the value of the exponent used for this backoff at (1&lt;&lt;16) which is
larger than currently necessary, but large enough to support bigger
values in the future.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:33:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53273 | Drivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53273</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids

relid2channel() assumes vmbus channel array to be allocated when called.
However, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will be reset by the host.
When the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt during
vmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes,
or if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls
relid2channel() and can cause a null pointer dereference.

Print a warning and error out in relid2channel() for a channel id that's invalid

clk: mediatek: mt8183: Add back SSPM related clocks

This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.

On the MT8183, the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of
usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to
the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space
for all the clocks defined in the clock driver, not the highest index
in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes
in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented
clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption,
leading to crashes in unrelated areas, or nothing at all. KASAN will
detect them.

Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully
implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management
co-processor, and should never be turned off. They are marked as such.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:33:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53275 | ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53275</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

The variable codec-&gt;regmap is often protected by the lock
codec-&gt;regmap_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without
holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():

  if (codec-&gt;regmap)

In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec-&gt;regmap is
set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
dereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():

  map-&gt;lock(map-&gt;lock_arg); --&gt; Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
mutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
function call to regcache_sync().

[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current
  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for
  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.
  But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged
  as is -- tiwai ]</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:33:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53276 | ubifs: Free memory for tmpfile name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53276</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: staging: rtl8723bs: Fix locking in _rtw_join_timeout_handler()

Commit 041879b12ddb ("drivers: staging: rtl8192bs: Fix deadlock in
rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle()") besides fixing the deadlock also
modified _rtw_join_timeout_handler() to use spin_[un]lock_irq()
instead of spin_[un]lock_bh().

_rtw_join_timeout_handler() calls rtw_do_join() which takes
pmlmepriv-&gt;scanned_queue.lock using spin_[un]lock_bh(). This
spin_unlock_bh() call re-enables softirqs which triggers an oops in
kernel/softirq.c: __local_bh_enable_ip() when it calls
lockdep_assert_irqs_enabled():

This oops is causd by the switch to spin_[un]lock_irq() which disables
the IRQs for the entire duration of _rtw_join_timeout_handler().

Disabling the IRQs is not necessary since all code taking this lock
runs from either user contexts or from softirqs, switch back to
spin_[un]lock_bh() to fix this.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:33:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53282 | scsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free KFENCE violation during sysfs firmware write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53282</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The PCI root bus is in this case created from ACPI description via
acpi_pci_root_add() -&gt; pci_acpi_scan_root() -&gt; acpi_pci_root_create() -&gt;
pci_create_root_bus() where the last function is called with
parent=NULL. It indicates that no parent is present and then
bus-&gt;bridge-&gt;parent is NULL too.

drm/msm/dpu: check for null return of devm_kzalloc() in dpu_writeback_init()

Because of the possilble failure of devm_kzalloc(), dpu_wb_conn might
be NULL and will cause null pointer dereference later.

Therefore, it might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM.

RDMA/mlx5: Return the firmware result upon destroying QP/RQ

Previously when destroying a QP/RQ, the result of the firmware
destruction function was ignored and upper layers weren't informed
about the failure.
Which in turn could lead to various problems since when upper layer
isn't aware of the failure it continues its operation thinking that the
related QP/RQ was successfully destroyed while it actually wasn't,
which could lead to the below kernel WARN.

Currently, we return the correct firmware destruction status to upper
layers which in case of the RQ would be mlx5_ib_destroy_wq() which
was already capable of handling RQ destruction failure or in case of
a QP to destroy_qp_common(), which now would actually warn upon qp
destruction failure.

sctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf

This patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream count may change
after wait_for_sndbuf.

When the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream
count is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N - 2,
another thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number
N - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.

However, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream count in the client is
shrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The crash
occurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a
non-existing stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:

NOTE: in current versions of several applications, connection attempts to the IP address 0 (interpreted as 0.0.0.0) are blocked with error messages such as net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID. However, in some situations that depend on both application version and operating system, connection attempts to 0 and 0.0.0.0 are considered connection attempts to 127.0.0.1 (and, for this reason, a false value of isPublic would be preferable).</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 02:37:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10483 | SourceCodester Online Student File Management System save_user.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10483</link><description>A flaw has been found in SourceCodester Online Student File Management System 1.0.

Openfire’s SASL EXTERNAL mechanism for client TLS authentication contains a vulnerability in how it extracts user identities from X.509 certificates. Instead of parsing the structured ASN.1 data, the code calls X509Certificate.getSubjectDN().getName() and applies a regex to look for CN=. This method produces a provider-dependent string that does not escape special characters. In SunJSSE (sun.security.x509.X500Name), for example, commas and equals signs inside attribute values are not escaped. As a result, a malicious certificate can embed CN= inside another attribute value (e.g. OU="CN=admin,"). The regex will incorrectly interpret this as a legitimate Common Name and extract admin. If SASL EXTERNAL is enabled and configured to map CNs to user accounts, this allows the attacker to impersonate another user. The fix is included in Openfire 5.0.2 and 5.1.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 20:18:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45091 | Seafile versions 11.0.18-Pro, 12.0.10, and 12.0.10-Pro are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

From 1.4.0 to before 1.5.0, hackmd-mcp contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability when the server is run in HTTP transport mode. Arbitrary hackmdApiUrl values supplied via the Hackmd-Api-Url HTTP header or a base64-encoded JSON query parameter are accepted without validation, allowing attackers to redirect outbound API requests to internal network services, access internal endpoints, perform network reconnaissance, and bypass network access controls. The stdio transport mode is not affected because it only accepts stdio requests. The issue is fixed in version 1.5.0, which enforces allowed endpoints and supports the ALLOWED_HACKMD_API_URLS environment variable. Users should update to 1.5.0 or later or apply documented mitigations such as switching to stdio mode, restricting outbound network access, or filtering the Hackmd-Api-Url header and related query parameter via a reverse proxy.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 17:20:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58177 | n8n stored cross-site scripting in LangChain Chat Trigger node initialMessages parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58177</link><description>n8n is an open source workflow automation platform.

The issue stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can supply a large, specially crafted data payload that, when processed, consumes an excessive amount of CPU resources during the deserialization process. This leads to CPU exhaustion, rendering the application or system using the Apache Fory library unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

Users of Apache Fory are strongly advised to upgrade to version 0.12.2 or later to mitigate this vulnerability. Developers of libraries and applications that depend on Apache Fory should update their dependency requirements to Apache Fory 0.12.2 or later and release new versions of their software.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:38:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57174 | An issue was discovered in Siklu Communications Etherhaul 8010TX and 1200FX devices, Firmware 7.4.0 through 10.7.3 and possibly other previo...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57174</link><description>An issue was discovered in Siklu Communications Etherhaul 8010TX and 1200FX devices, Firmware 7.4.0 through 10.7.3 and possibly other previous versions.

The two bridges (stdp2690, stdp4028) do not probe at the same time, so
the driver does not call ge_b850v3_resgiter() when probing, causing the

Fix this by checking whether both the bridges are probed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50318 | perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in hswep_has_limit_sbox()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50318</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: tables: FPDT: Don't call acpi_os_map_memory() on invalid phys address

On a Packard Bell Dot SC (Intel Atom N2600 model) there is a FPDT table
which contains invalid physical addresses, with high bits set which fall
outside the range of the CPU-s supported physical address range.

Calling acpi_os_map_memory() on such an invalid phys address leads to
the below WARN_ON in ioremap triggering resulting in an oops/stacktrace.

Add code to verify the physical address before calling acpi_os_map_memory()
to fix / avoid the oops.

rtc: msc313: Fix function prototype mismatch in msc313_rtc_probe()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

msc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which
did not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s
callback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50323 | net: do not sense pfmemalloc status in skb_append_pagefrags()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50323</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix the problem by moving bfq_exit_bfqq() behind bic_set_bfqq().</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50330 | crypto: cavium - prevent integer overflow loading firmware</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50330</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: cavium - prevent integer overflow loading firmware

The "code_length" value comes from the firmware file.  If your firmware
is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to
protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible.
Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and
prints warnings if it not capped correctly.

The "ntohl(ucode-&gt;code_length) * 2" multiplication can have an
integer overflow.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50331 | wwan_hwsim: fix possible memory leak in wwan_hwsim_dev_new()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50331</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

the hardware. Both drivers interfere with each other and results are
undefined.

The problem was added by commit 5e0137612430 ("video/aperture: Disable
and unregister sysfb devices via aperture helpers") to v6.0.3 and does
not exist in the mainline branch.

The mainline commit 5e0137612430 ("video/aperture: Disable and
unregister sysfb devices via aperture helpers") has been backported
from v6.0-rc1 to stable v6.0.3 from a larger patch series [2] that
reworks fbdev framebuffer ownership. The backport misses a change to
aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(). Mainline itself is fine,
because the function does not exist there as a result of the patch
series.

Instead of backporting the whole series, fix the additional function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50333 | fs: jfs: fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbDiscardAG</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50333</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

======================================================

According to commit "vfs: parse: deal with zero length string value",
kernel will set the param-&gt;string to null pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string()
if fs string has zero length.

Yet the problem is that, hugetlbfs_parse_param() will dereference the
param-&gt;string, without checking whether it is a null pointer.  To be more
specific, if hugetlbfs_parse_param() parses an illegal mount parameter,
such as "size=,", kernel will constructs struct fs_parameter with null
pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string(), then passes this struct fs_parameter to
hugetlbfs_parse_param(), which triggers the above null-ptr-deref bug.

This patch solves it by adding sanity check on param-&gt;string
in hugetlbfs_parse_param().</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50335 | 9p: set req refcount to zero to avoid uninitialized usage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50335</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p: set req refcount to zero to avoid uninitialized usage

When a new request is allocated, the refcount will be zero if it is
reused, but if the request is newly allocated from slab, it is not fully
initialized before being added to idr.

If the p9_read_work got a response before the refcount initiated. It will
use a uninitialized req, which will result in a bad request data struct.

Here is the logs from syzbot.

ocxl: fix pci device refcount leak when calling get_function_0()

get_function_0() calls pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(), as comment
says, it returns a pci device with refcount increment, so after
using it, pci_dev_put() needs be called.

Get the device reference when get_function_0() is not called, so

binder: fix UAF of alloc-&gt;vma in race with munmap()

In commit 720c24192404 ("ANDROID: binder: change down_write to
down_read") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect
alloc-&gt;vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate
until commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma
from the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the
vma with only the read lock held.

This means that accesses to alloc-&gt;vma in binder_update_page_range() now
will race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown
in the following KASAN trace:

  ==================================================================

To prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock
inside binder_update_page_range(). One might expect an increase of mmap
lock contention. However, binder already serializes these calls via top
level alloc-&gt;mutex. Also, there was no performance impact shown when
running the binder benchmark tests.

Note this patch is specific to stable branches 5.4 and 5.10. Since in
newer kernel releases binder no longer caches a pointer to the vma.
Instead, it has been refactored to use vma_lookup() which avoids the
issue described here. This switch was introduced in commit a43cfc87caaf
("android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA").</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53248 | drm/amdgpu: install stub fence into potential unused fence pointers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53248</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: use RCU for hci_conn_params and iterate safely in hci_sync

hci_update_accept_list_sync iterates over hdev-&gt;pend_le_conns and
hdev-&gt;pend_le_reports, and waits for controller events in the loop body,
without holding hdev lock.

Meanwhile, these lists and the items may be modified e.g. by
le_scan_cleanup. This can invalidate the list cursor or any other item
in the list, resulting to invalid behavior (eg use-after-free).

Use RCU for the hci_conn_params action lists. Since the loop bodies in
hci_sync block and we cannot use RCU or hdev-&gt;lock for the whole loop,
copy list items first and then iterate on the copy. Only the flags field
is written from elsewhere, so READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE should guarantee we
read valid values.

Free params everywhere with hci_conn_params_free so the cleanup is
guaranteed to be done properly.

This fixes the following, which can be triggered e.g. by BlueZ new
mgmt-tester case "Add + Remove Device Nowait - Success", or by changing
hci_le_set_cig_params to always return false, and running iso-tester:

Another problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache does

firmware: arm_ffa: Fix FFA device names for logical partitions

Each physical partition can provide multiple services each with UUID.
Each such service can be presented as logical partition with a unique
combination of VM ID and UUID. The number of distinct UUID in a system
will be less than or equal to the number of logical partitions.

However, currently it fails to register more than one logical partition
or service within a physical partition as the device name contains only
VM ID while both VM ID and UUID are maintained in the partition information.
The kernel complains with the below message:

By virtue of being random enough to avoid collisions when generated in a
distributed system, there is no way to compress UUID keys to the number
of bits required to identify each. We can eliminate '-' in the name but
it is not worth eliminating 4 bytes and add unnecessary logic for doing
that. Also v1.0 doesn't provide the UUID of the partitions which makes
it hard to use the same for the device name.

So to keep it simple, let us alloc an ID using ida_alloc() and append the
same to "arm-ffa" to make up a unique device name. Also stash the id value
in ffa_dev to help freeing the ID later when the device is destroyed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53257 | wifi: mac80211: check S1G action frame size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53257</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The ACPI buffer memory (buf.pointer) should be freed. But the buffer
is also used after returning from acpi_get_dsd_graph().
Move the temporary variables buf to acpi_coresight_parse_graph(),
and free it before the function return to prevent memory leak.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53262 | f2fs: fix scheduling while atomic in decompression path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53262</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe
deferral.

Fix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of
the bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.

btrfs: do not BUG_ON() on ENOMEM when dropping extent items for a range

If we get -ENOMEM while dropping file extent items in a given range, at
btrfs_drop_extents(), due to failure to allocate memory when attempting to
increment the reference count for an extent or drop the reference count,
we handle it with a BUG_ON(). This is excessive, instead we can simply
abort the transaction and return the error to the caller. In fact most
callers of btrfs_drop_extents(), directly or indirectly, already abort
the transaction if btrfs_drop_extents() returns any error.

Also, we already have error paths at btrfs_drop_extents() that may return
-ENOMEM and in those cases we abort the transaction, like for example
anything that changes the b+tree may return -ENOMEM due to a failure to
allocate a new extent buffer when COWing an existing extent buffer, such
as a call to btrfs_duplicate_item() for example.

So replace the BUG_ON() calls with proper logic to abort the transaction
and return the error.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50294 | wifi: libertas: fix memory leak in lbs_init_adapter()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50294</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

have the expected endpoints. (In this case there was an interrupt
endpoint where the driver expected a bulk endpoint.) The kernel
needs to be able to handle such devices without getting an internal error.

md: Replace snprintf with scnprintf

Current code produces a warning as shown below when total characters
in the constituent block device names plus the slashes exceeds 200.
snprintf() returns the number of characters generated from the given
input, which could cause the expression “200 – len” to wrap around
to a large positive number. Fix this by using scnprintf() instead,
which returns the actual number of characters written into the buffer.

btrfs: fix extent map use-after-free when handling missing device in read_one_chunk

Store the error code before freeing the extent_map. Though it's
reference counted structure, in that function it's the first and last
allocation so this would lead to a potential use-after-free.

The error can happen eg. when chunk is stored on a missing device and
the degraded mount option is missing.

There are two issues here:

1) The "len" variable needs to be checked before the very first write.
   Otherwise if omap2_iommu_dump_ctx() with "bytes" less than 32 it is a
   buffer overflow.
2) The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes that *would* have
   been copied if there were enough space.  But we want to know the
   number of bytes which were *actually* copied so use scnprintf()

s390/cio: fix out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free

The channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available devices whenever
device-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:

  echo free &gt;/proc/cio_ignore

Since an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit
172da89ed0ea ("s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests")
introduced an optimization to exclude online devices from the scan.

The newly added check for online devices incorrectly assumes that
an I/O-subchannel's drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private.
For devices that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such
as the vfio_ccw driver, this results in an out-of-bounds read access
during each scan.

Fix this by changing the scan logic to rely on a driver-independent
online indication. For this we can use struct subchannel-&gt;config.ena,
which is the driver's requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os
can only be started on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent
of the original optimization of not scanning devices where I/O might
be running.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50308 | ASoC: qcom: Add checks for devm_kcalloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50308</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

release the net, accessing devconf-&gt;mc_forwarding directly causes invalid
pointer access.

The process is as follows:

As syzbot reported [1], the root cause is that i_size field is a

As a consequence, it's handled as fast symlink unexpectedly.

Let's fall back to the generic path to deal with such unusual i_size.

nbd: Fix hung when signal interrupts nbd_start_device_ioctl()

syzbot reported hung task [1].  The following program is a simplified
version of the reproducer:

int main(void)
{
	int sv[2], fd;

	if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sv) &lt; 0)
		return 1;
	if ((fd = open("/dev/nbd0", 0)) &lt; 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_SET_SIZE_BLOCKS, 0x81) &lt; 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_SET_SOCK, sv[0]) &lt; 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_DO_IT) &lt; 0)
		return 1;
	return 0;
}

When signal interrupt nbd_start_device_ioctl() waiting the condition
atomic_read(&amp;amp;config-&gt;recv_threads) == 0, the task can hung because it

This happens because sata_pmp_init_links() initialize link-&gt;pmp up to
SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS while em_priv is declared as 8 elements array.

I can't find the maximum Enclosure Management ports specified in AHCI
spec v1.3.1, but "12.2.1 LED message type" states that "Port Multiplier
Information" can utilize 4 bits, which implies it can support up to 16
ports. Hence, use SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS as EM_MAX_SLOTS to resolve the
issue.

btrfs: add handling for RAID1C23/DUP to btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile

Callers of `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` expect it to return exactly
one allocation profile flag, and failing to do so may ultimately
result in a WARN_ON and remount-ro when allocating new blocks, like
the below transaction abort on 6.1.

`btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has two ways of determining the profile,
first it checks if a conversion balance is currently running and
uses the profile we're converting to. If no balance is currently
running, it returns the max-redundancy profile which at least one
block in the selected block group has.

This works by simply checking each known allocation profile bit in
redundancy order. However, `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has not been
updated as new flags have been added - first with the `DUP` profile
and later with the RAID1C34 profiles.

Because of the way it checks, if we have blocks with different
profiles and at least one is known, that profile will be selected.
However, if none are known we may return a flag set with multiple
allocation profiles set.

This is currently only possible when a balance from one of the three
unhandled profiles to another of the unhandled profiles is canceled
after allocating at least one block using the new profile.

In that case, a transaction abort like the below will occur and the
filesystem will need to be mounted with -o skip_balance to get it
mounted rw again (but the balance cannot be resumed without a
similar abort).

media: pci: tw68: Fix null-ptr-deref bug in buf prepare and finish

When the driver calls tw68_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
function call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer
buf-&gt;cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
deref is triggered.

This bug is similar to the following one:
https://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.

We believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.
Similarly, we fix this by checking the return value of tw68_risc_buffer()
and the value of buf-&gt;cpu before buffer free.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53245 | scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53245</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts

Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host
system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC
device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a
partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic
portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed
in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC
don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't
practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.

In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout
function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the
rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the
call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this
regard.

In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation
can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests
issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent
failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,
which again may be better.

So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This
allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested
by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient
timeouts, and it solves their problem.

In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc
since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is
working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53246 | cifs: fix DFS traversal oops without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53246</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix DFS traversal oops without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL

S_AUTOMOUNT and corresponding dentry flags is retained regardless of
CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in
VFS follow_automount() when traversing a DFS referral link:

This happens because during btrfs_cont_expand we'll get a page, set it
as mapped, and if it's not Uptodate we'll read it.  However between the
read and re-locking the page we could have called release_folio() on the
page, but left the page in the file mapping.  release_folio() can clear
the page private, and thus further down we blow up when we go to modify
the subpage bits.

Fix this by putting the set_page_extent_mapped() after the read.  This
is safe because read_folio() will call set_page_extent_mapped() before
it does the read, and then if we clear page private but leave it on the
mapping we're completely safe re-setting set_page_extent_mapped().  With
this patch I can now run generic/476 without panicing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50266 | kprobes: Fix check for probe enabled in kill_kprobe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50266</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

false.

The disarm_kprobe_ftrace() call introduced by commit:

The reason is that the vkms_init() returns without checking the return

The root cause is: in fuzzed image, SIT table is inconsistent with inode
mapping table, result in triggering such warning during SIT table update.

This patch introduces a new flag DATA_GENERIC_ENHANCE_UPDATE, w/ this

ext4: don't allow journal inode to have encrypt flag

Mounting a filesystem whose journal inode has the encrypt flag causes a
NULL dereference in fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() when the 'inlinecrypt'
mount option is used.

The problem is that when jbd2_journal_init_inode() calls bmap(), it
eventually finds its way into ext4_iomap_begin(), which calls
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks().  fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() requires that if
the inode is encrypted, then its encryption key must already be set up.
That's not the case here, since the journal inode is never "opened" like
a normal file would be.  Hence the crash.

A reproducer is:

    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdb
    debugfs -w /dev/vdb -R "set_inode_field &lt;8&gt; flags 0x80808"
    mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o inlinecrypt

To fix this, make ext4 consider journal inodes with the encrypt flag to
be invalid.  (Note, maybe other flags should be rejected on the journal
inode too.  For now, this is just the minimal fix for the above issue.)

I've marked this as fixing the commit that introduced the call to
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks(), since that's what made an actual crash start
being possible.  But this fix could be applied to any version of ext4
that supports the encrypt feature.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:33:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50278 | PNP: fix name memory leak in pnp_alloc_dev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50278</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The root cause of the problem is that the comparison order of
"prate_section" in _rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit() is wrong. The
_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two
strings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the
_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet
this requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.
For example, "pregulation" and "pbandwidth" are compared in order of
length from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the
comparison order of "prate_section" dose not obey such order requirement,
therefore when "prate_section" is "HT", when comparing from tail to head,
it will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As
mentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as
strcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.

Fix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.
Although it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of
"prate_section", this may cause the value of "rate_section" to not be
from 0 to 5. In addition, commit "21e4b0726dc6" not only moved driver
from staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit
function during the driver config phase, so the problem was introduced
by this commit.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:33:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50280 | pnode: terminate at peers of source</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50280</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pnode: terminate at peers of source

The propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating
mounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all
applicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by
@dest_mnt.

Unfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of
@source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become
masters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in
the destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.

Once the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.
Because of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged
users.

While fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to
unclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some
clarifications:

* The terms "master" or "peer" denote a shared mount. A shared mount
  belongs to a peer group.

* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.
  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available
  in @shared_mnt-&gt;mnt_group_id.
  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.
  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt-&gt;mnt_share.

* The terms "slave mount" or "dependent mount" denote a mount that
  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts
  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their
  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on
  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt-&gt;mnt_slave_list.

* The term "master mount" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it
  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term
  "master mount" - or "master" for short - is mostly used when talking
  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master
  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a
  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can
  be identified via @slave_mount-&gt;mnt_master. Different slaves may point
  to different masters in the same peer group.

* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty -&gt;mnt_slave_lists.
  Non-empty -&gt;mnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to
  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the
  -&gt;mnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.

* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive
  propagation from via @slave_mnt-&gt;mnt_master (see above). Together with
  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest
  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id
  @slave_mnt-&gt;mnt_master-&gt;mnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave
  mount receives propagation from.

* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also
  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive
  propagation from another peer group.

  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all
  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via
  -&gt;mnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same
  -&gt;mnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.

* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group
  but is not a peer in another peer group.

* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single
  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point
  to a peer in that peer group via -&gt;mnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts
  such that @slave_mnt-&gt;mnt_master-&gt;mnt_group_id is equal to
  @shared_mnt-&gt;mnt_group_id.

  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a
  single propagation level in a propagation tree.

  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and
  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr

ext4: fix delayed allocation bug in ext4_clu_mapped for bigalloc + inline

When converting files with inline data to extents, delayed allocations
made on a file system created with both the bigalloc and inline options
can result in invalid extent status cache content, incorrect reserved
cluster counts, kernel memory leaks, and potential kernel panics.

With bigalloc, the code that determines whether a block must be
delayed allocated searches the extent tree to see if that block maps
to a previously allocated cluster.  If not, the block is delayed
allocated, and otherwise, it isn't.  However, if the inline option is
also used, and if the file containing the block is marked as able to
store data inline, there isn't a valid extent tree associated with
the file.  The current code in ext4_clu_mapped() calls
ext4_find_extent() to search the non-existent tree for a previously
allocated cluster anyway, which typically finds nothing, as desired.
However, a side effect of the search can be to cache invalid content
from the non-existent tree (garbage) in the extent status tree,
including bogus entries in the pending reservation tree.

To fix this, avoid searching the extent tree when allocating blocks
for bigalloc + inline files that are being converted from inline to
extent mapped.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:33:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50287 | drm/i915/bios: fix a memory leak in generate_lfp_data_ptrs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50287</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/bios: fix a memory leak in generate_lfp_data_ptrs

When (size != 0 || ptrs-&gt;lvds_ entries != 3), the program tries to
free() the ptrs. However, the ptrs is not created by calling kzmalloc(),
but is obtained by pointer offset operation.
This may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.

Fix this by replacing the arguments of kfree() with ptrs_block.

qlcnic: prevent -&gt;dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure

adapter-&gt;dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in
case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens
under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both
of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained
pointer, which is potentially freed at that point.

Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb
pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now
unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around
kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails

Syzkaller detected a memory leak of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().
While processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(), the already allocated
skbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If we
have an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid
and dropped. All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be
dropped and freed. Added a comment describing this issue.

The patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that it
cannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev
fields which are associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len,
rx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after a new remain_skb is
allocated.

netfilter: x_tables: fix percpu counter block leak on error path when creating new netns

Here is the stack where we allocate percpu counter block:

  +-&lt; __alloc_percpu
    +-&lt; xt_percpu_counter_alloc
      +-&lt; find_check_entry # {arp,ip,ip6}_tables.c
        +-&lt; translate_table

And it can be leaked on this code path:

  +-&gt; ip6t_register_table
    +-&gt; translate_table # allocates percpu counter block
    +-&gt; xt_register_table # fails

there is no freeing of the counter block on xt_register_table fail.
Note: xt_percpu_counter_free should be called to free it like we do in
do_replace through cleanup_entry helper (or in __ip6t_unregister_table).

Probability of hitting this error path is low AFAICS (xt_register_table
can only return ENOMEM here, as it is not replacing anything, as we are
creating new netns, and it is hard to imagine that all previous
allocations succeeded and after that one in xt_register_table failed).
But it's worth fixing even the rare leak.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53201 | RDMA/bnxt_re: wraparound mbox producer index</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53201</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: wraparound mbox producer index

Driver is not handling the wraparound of the mbox producer index correctly.
Currently the wraparound happens once u32 max is reached.

Bit 31 of the producer index register is special and should be set
only once for the first command. Because the producer index overflow
setting bit31 after a long time, FW goes to initialization sequence
and this causes FW hang.

Fix is to wraparound the mbox producer index once it reaches u16 max.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53202 | PM: domains: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53202</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Load L1's TSC multiplier based on L1 state, not L2 state

When emulating nested VM-Exit, load L1's TSC multiplier if L1's desired
ratio doesn't match the current ratio, not if the ratio L1 is using for
L2 diverges from the default.  Functionally, the end result is the same
as KVM will run L2 with L1's multiplier if L2's multiplier is the default,
i.e. checking that L1's multiplier is loaded is equivalent to checking if
L2 has a non-default multiplier.

However, the assertion that TSC scaling is exposed to L1 is flawed, as
userspace can trigger the WARN at will by writing the MSR and then
updating guest CPUID to hide the feature (modifying guest CPUID is
allowed anytime before KVM_RUN).  E.g. hacking KVM's state_test
selftest to do

                vcpu_set_msr(vcpu, MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO, 0);
                vcpu_clear_cpuid_feature(vcpu, X86_FEATURE_TSCRATEMSR);

after restoring state in a new VM+vCPU yields an endless supply of:

  ------------[ cut here ]------------

Unlike the nested VMRUN path, hoisting the svm-&gt;tsc_scaling_enabled check
into the if-statement is wrong as KVM needs to ensure L1's multiplier is
loaded in the above scenario.   Alternatively, the WARN_ON() could simply
be deleted, but that would make KVM's behavior even more subtle, e.g. it's
not immediately obvious why it's safe to write MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO when
checking only tsc_ratio_msr.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53209 | wifi: mac80211_hwsim: Fix possible NULL dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53209</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

r5l_flush_stripe_to_raid() will check if the list 'flushing_ios' is
empty, and then submit 'flush_bio', however, r5l_log_flush_endio()
is clearing the list first and then clear the bio, which will cause
null-ptr-deref:

T1: submit flush io

  r5l_flush_stripe_to_raid
   // list is empty
   // add 'io_end_ios' to the list
   bio_init

T2: io1 is done
r5l_log_flush_endio
 list_splice_tail_init
 // clear the list
			T3: submit new flush io
			...
			r5l_flush_stripe_to_raid
			 // list is empty
			 // add 'io_end_ios' to the list
			 bio_init
 bio_uninit
 // clear bio-&gt;bi_blkg
			 submit_bio
			 // null-ptr-deref

Fix this problem by clearing bio before clearing the list in
r5l_log_flush_endio().</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53211 | driver core: location: Free struct acpi_pld_info *pld before return false</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53211</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The bug could occur when assoc_info-&gt;req_len, data from a URB provided

Further investigation shows that the warning is superfluous, the migration
disabled task is just going to be migrated to its current running CPU.
This is because that on load balance if the dst_cpu is not allowed by the
task, we'll re-select a new_dst_cpu as a candidate. If no task can be
balanced to dst_cpu we'll try to balance the task to the new_dst_cpu
instead. In this case when the migration disabled task is not on CPU it
only allows to run on its current CPU, load balance will select its
current CPU as new_dst_cpu and later triggers the warning above.

The new_dst_cpu is chosen from the env-&gt;dst_grpmask. Currently it
contains CPUs in sched_group_span() and if we have overlapped groups it's
possible to run into this case. This patch makes env-&gt;dst_grpmask of
group_balance_mask() which exclude any CPUs from the busiest group and
solve the issue. For balancing in a domain with no overlapped groups
the behaviour keeps same as before.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53216 | arm64: efi: Make efi_rt_lock a raw_spinlock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53216</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted

When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
connection parameters.

However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
made.

Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
oops may follow shortly thereafter.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53219 | media: netup_unidvb: fix use-after-free at del_timer()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53219</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: netup_unidvb: fix use-after-free at del_timer()

When Universal DVB card is detaching, netup_unidvb_dma_fini()
uses del_timer() to stop dma-&gt;timeout timer. But when timer
handler netup_unidvb_dma_timeout() is running, del_timer()
could not stop it. As a result, the use-after-free bug could
happen. The process is shown below:

bpf: Fix memleak due to fentry attach failure

If it fails to attach fentry, the allocated bpf trampoline image will be
left in the system. That can be verified by checking /proc/kallsyms.

This meamleak can be verified by a simple bpf program as follows:

  SEC("fentry/trap_init")
  int fentry_run()
  {
      return 0;
  }

It will fail to attach trap_init because this function is freed after
kernel init, and then we can find the trampoline image is left in the
system by checking /proc/kallsyms.

  $ tail /proc/kallsyms
  ffffffffc0613000 t bpf_trampoline_6442453466_1  [bpf]
  ffffffffc06c3000 t bpf_trampoline_6442453466_1  [bpf]

  $ echo $((6442453466 &amp; 0x7fffffff))

Note that there are two left bpf trampoline images, that is because the
libbpf will fallback to raw tracepoint if -EINVAL is returned.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53222 | jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53222</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting

In jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block
number inside dbFree(). db_l2nbperpage, which is the log2 number of
blocks per page, is passed as an argument to BLKTODMAP which uses it
for shifting.

Syzbot reported a shift out-of-bounds crash because db_l2nbperpage is
too big. This happens because the large value is set without any
validation in dbMount() at line 181.

Thus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.

ext4: Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

ext4_feat_ktype was setting the "release" handler to "kfree", which
doesn't have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper
with the correct prototype.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.

Note that this code is only reached when ext4 is a loadable module and
it is being unloaded:

erofs: Fix detection of atomic context

Current check for atomic context is not sufficient as
z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio can be called under rcu lock
from blk_mq_flush_plug_list(). See the stacktrace [1]

In such case we should hand off the decompression work for async
processing rather than trying to do sync decompression in current
context. Patch fixes the detection by checking for
rcu_read_lock_any_held() and while at it use more appropriate
!in_task() check than in_atomic().

Background: Historically erofs would always schedule a kworker for
decompression which would incur the scheduling cost regardless of
the context. But z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() may not always
be in atomic context and we could actually benefit from doing the
decompression in z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() if we are in
thread context, for example when running with dm-verity.
This optimization was later added in patch [2] which has shown
improvement in performance benchmarks.

mt76: mt7921: fix kernel panic by accessing unallocated eeprom.data

The MT7921 driver no longer uses eeprom.data, but the relevant code has not
been removed completely since
commit 16d98b548365 ("mt76: mt7921: rely on mcu_get_nic_capability").
This could result in potential invalid memory access.

To fix the kernel panic issue in mt7921, it is necessary to avoid accessing
unallocated eeprom.data which can lead to invalid memory access.

Furthermore, it is possible to entirely eliminate the
mt7921_mcu_parse_eeprom function and solely depend on
mt7921_mcu_parse_response to divide the RxD header.

The reason is that put_device is not be called if cdev_device_add fails
and wdd-&gt;id != 0.

watchdog_cdev_register
  wd_data = kzalloc                             [1]
  err = dev_set_name                            [2]
  ..
  err = cdev_device_add
  if (err) {
    if (wdd-&gt;id == 0) {  // wdd-&gt;id != 0
      ..
    }
    return err;  // [1],[2] would be leaked

To fix it, call put_device in all wdd-&gt;id cases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53235 | drm/tests: helpers: Avoid a driver uaf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53235</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tests: helpers: Avoid a driver uaf

when using __drm_kunit_helper_alloc_drm_device() the driver may be
dereferenced by device-managed resources up until the device is
freed, which is typically later than the kunit-managed resource code
frees it. Fix this by simply make the driver device-managed as well.

In short, the sequence leading to the UAF is as follows:

INIT:
Code allocates a struct device as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm driver as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm device as a device-managed resource.

EXIT:
Kunit resource cleanup frees the drm driver
Kunit resource cleanup puts the struct device, which starts a
      device-managed resource cleanup
device-managed cleanup calls drm_dev_put()
drm_dev_put() dereferences the (now freed) drm driver -&gt; Boom.

iommufd: Do not corrupt the pfn list when doing batch carry

If batch-&gt;end is 0 then setting npfns[0] before computing the new value of
pfns will fail to adjust the pfn and result in various page accounting
corruptions. It should be ordered after.

This seems to result in various kinds of page meta-data corruption related

drm/amdgpu: fix amdgpu_irq_put call trace in gmc_v11_0_hw_fini

The gmc.ecc_irq is enabled by firmware per IFWI setting,
and the host driver is not privileged to enable/disable
the interrupt. So, it is meaningless to use the amdgpu_irq_put
function in gmc_v11_0_hw_fini, which also leads to the call
trace.

phy: hisilicon: Fix an out of bounds check in hisi_inno_phy_probe()

The size of array 'priv-&gt;ports[]' is INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM.

In the for loop, 'i' is used as the index for array 'priv-&gt;ports[]'
with a check (i &gt; INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM) which indicates that
INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM is allowed value for 'i' in the same loop.

This &gt; comparison needs to be changed to &gt;=, otherwise it potentially leads
to an out of bounds write on the next iteration through the loop</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53239 | drm/msm/mdp5: Add check for kzalloc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53239</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

As kzalloc may fail and return NULL pointer,
it should be better to check the return value

xsk: check IFF_UP earlier in Tx path

Xsk Tx can be triggered via either sendmsg() or poll() syscalls. These
two paths share a call to common function xsk_xmit() which has two
sanity checks within. A pseudo code example to show the two paths:

__xsk_sendmsg() :                       xsk_poll():
if (unlikely(!xsk_is_bound(xs)))        if (unlikely(!xsk_is_bound(xs)))
    return -ENXIO;                          return mask;
if (unlikely(need_wait))                (...)
    return -EOPNOTSUPP;                 xsk_xmit()
mark napi id
(...)
xsk_xmit()

xsk_xmit():
if (unlikely(!(xs-&gt;dev-&gt;flags &amp; IFF_UP)))
	return -ENETDOWN;
if (unlikely(!xs-&gt;tx))
	return -ENOBUFS;

As it can be observed above, in sendmsg() napi id can be marked on
interface that was not brought up and this causes a NULL ptr
dereference:

nfsd: call op_release, even when op_func returns an error

For ops with "trivial" replies, nfsd4_encode_operation will shortcut
most of the encoding work and skip to just marshalling up the status.
One of the things it skips is calling op_release. This could cause a
memory leak in the layoutget codepath if there is an error at an
inopportune time.

Have the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when
op_func sets an error in op-&gt;status. With this change, we also need
nfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL
on error to avoid a double free.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53242 | thermal/drivers/hisi: Drop second sensor hi3660</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53242</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/drivers/hisi: Drop second sensor hi3660

The commit 74c8e6bffbe1 ("driver core: Add __alloc_size hint to devm
allocators") exposes a panic "BRK handler: Fatal exception" on the
hi3660_thermal_probe funciton.
This is because the function allocates memory for only one
sensors array entry, but tries to fill up a second one.

Fix this by removing the unneeded second access.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:34:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50262 | fs/ntfs3: Validate BOOT record_size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50262</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Validate BOOT record_size

When the NTFS BOOT record_size field &lt; 0, it represents a

and the sbi-&gt;record_bits calculation through blksize_bits() assumes
the size always &gt; 256, which could lead to NPD while mounting a

Instead of putting io_uring's registered files in unix_gc() we want it
to be done by io_uring itself. The trick here is to consider io_uring
registered files for cycle detection but not actually putting them down.
Because io_uring can't register other ring instances, this will remove
all refs to the ring file triggering the -&gt;release path and clean up
with io_ring_ctx_free().

cpufreq: qcom: fix writes in read-only memory region

This commit fixes a kernel oops because of a write in some read-only memory:

	[    9.068287] Unable to handle kernel write to read-only memory at virtual address ffff800009240ad8
	..snip..
	[    9.138790] Internal error: Oops: 9600004f [#1] PREEMPT SMP

	[    9.284869]  qcom_cpufreq_probe+0xc8/0x39c
	..snip..

The following line defines a pointer that point to a char buffer stored
in read-only memory:

	char *pvs_name = "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX";

This pointer is meant to hold a template "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX" where the
XX values get overridden by the qcom_cpufreq_krait_name_version function. Since
the template is actually stored in read-only memory, when the function
executes the following call we get an oops:

	snprintf(*pvs_name, sizeof("speedXX-pvsXX-vXX"), "speed%d-pvs%d-v%d",
		 speed, pvs, pvs_ver);

To fix this issue, we instead store the template name onto the stack by
using the following syntax:

	char pvs_name_buffer[] = "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX";

Because the `pvs_name` needs to be able to be assigned to NULL, the
template buffer is stored in the pvs_name_buffer and not under the
pvs_name variable.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50240 | binder: fix UAF of alloc-&amp;gt;vma in race with munmap()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50240</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix UAF of alloc-&gt;vma in race with munmap()

In commit 720c24192404 ("ANDROID: binder: change down_write to
down_read") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect
alloc-&gt;vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate
until commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma
from the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the
vma with only the read lock held.

This means that accesses to alloc-&gt;vma in binder_update_page_range() now
will race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown
in the following KASAN trace:

  ==================================================================

To prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock
inside binder_update_page_range(). One might expect an increase of mmap
lock contention. However, binder already serializes these calls via top
level alloc-&gt;mutex. Also, there was no performance impact shown when
running the binder benchmark tests.

Note this patch is specific to stable branches 5.4 and 5.10. Since in
newer kernel releases binder no longer caches a pointer to the vma.
Instead, it has been refactored to use vma_lookup() which avoids the
issue described here. This switch was introduced in commit a43cfc87caaf
("android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA").</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50241 | NFSD: fix use-after-free on source server when doing inter-server copy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50241</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix use-after-free on source server when doing inter-server copy

Use-after-free occurred when the laundromat tried to free expired
cpntf_state entry on the s2s_cp_stateids list after inter-server
copy completed. The sc_cp_list that the expired copy state was
inserted on was already freed.

When COPY completes, the Linux client normally sends LOCKU(lock_state x),
FREE_STATEID(lock_state x) and CLOSE(open_state y) to the source server.
The nfs4_put_stid call from nfsd4_free_stateid cleans up the copy state
from the s2s_cp_stateids list before freeing the lock state's stid.

However, sometimes the CLOSE was sent before the FREE_STATEID request.
When this happens, the nfsd4_close_open_stateid call from nfsd4_close
frees all lock states on its st_locks list without cleaning up the copy
state on the sc_cp_list list. When the time the FREE_STATEID arrives the
server returns BAD_STATEID since the lock state was freed. This causes
the use-after-free error to occur when the laundromat tries to free
the expired cpntf_state.

This patch adds a call to nfs4_free_cpntf_statelist in
nfsd4_close_open_stateid to clean up the copy state before calling
free_ol_stateid_reaplist to free the lock state's stid on the reaplist.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50242 | drivers: net: qlcnic: Fix potential memory leak in qlcnic_sriov_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50242</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When it returns an error from sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key(), the

while it's still used as active key in asoc. Then an use-after-free

This patch is to fix it by not replacing the sh_key when it returns
errors from sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() in sctp_auth_set_key().
For sctp_auth_set_active_key(), old active_key_id will be set back

the skb may also be freed in error case.  So, return 0 in that particular

regulator: core: fix use_count leakage when handling boot-on

I found a use_count leakage towards supply regulator of rdev with
boot-on option.

┌───────────────────┐           ┌───────────────────┐
│  regulator_dev A  │           │  regulator_dev B  │
│     (boot-on)     │           │     (boot-on)     │
│    use_count=0    │◀──supply──│    use_count=1    │
│                   │           │                   │
└───────────────────┘           └───────────────────┘

In case of rdev(A) configured with `regulator-boot-on', the use_count
of supplying regulator(B) will increment inside
regulator_enable(rdev-&gt;supply).

Thus, B will acts like always-on, and further balanced
regulator_enable/disable cannot actually disable it anymore.

However, B was also configured with `regulator-boot-on', we wish it
could be disabled afterwards.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50251 | mmc: vub300: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50251</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: vub300: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()

mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value, the memory
that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() will be leaked and it will lead a kernel
crash because of deleting not added device in the remove path.

So fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which will call
mmc_free_host(), besides, the timer added before mmc_add_host() needs be del.

And this patch fixes another missing call mmc_free_host() if usb_control_msg()
fails.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50252 | igb: Do not free q_vector unless new one was allocated</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50252</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reproducer doesn't really reproduce outside of syzkaller
environment, so I'm taking a guess here. It looks like we
do generate correct ETH_HLEN-sized packet, but we redirect
the packet to the tunneling device. Before we do so, we
__skb_pull l2 header and arrive again at skb-&gt;len == 0.
Doesn't seem like we can do anything better than having
an explicit check after __skb_pull?</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50254 | media: ov8865: Fix an error handling path in ov8865_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50254</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix reading strings from synthetic events

The follow commands caused a crash:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
  # echo 's:open char file[]' &gt; dynamic_events
  # echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:file=filename:onchange($file).trace(open,$file)' &gt; events/syscalls/sys_enter_openat/trigger'
  # echo 1 &gt; events/synthetic/open/enable

BOOM!

The problem is that the synthetic event field "char file[]" will read
the value given to it as a string without any memory checks to make sure
the address is valid. The above example will pass in the user space
address and the sythetic event code will happily call strlen() on it
and then strscpy() where either one will cause an oops when accessing
user space addresses.

Use the helper functions from trace_kprobe and trace_eprobe that can
read strings safely (and actually succeed when the address is from user
space and the memory is mapped in).

Now the above can show:

drm/meson: remove drm bridges at aggregate driver unbind time

drm bridges added by meson_encoder_hdmi_init and meson_encoder_cvbs_init
were not manually removed at module unload time, which caused dangling
references to freed memory to remain linked in the global bridge_list.

When loading the driver modules back in, the same functions would again
call drm_bridge_add, and when traversing the global bridge_list, would
end up peeking into freed memory.

Once again KASAN revealed the problem:

xen/gntdev: Prevent leaking grants

Prior to this commit, if a grant mapping operation failed partially,
some of the entries in the map_ops array would be invalid, whereas all
of the entries in the kmap_ops array would be valid. This in turn would
cause the following logic in gntdev_map_grant_pages to become invalid:

  for (i = 0; i &lt; map-&gt;count; i++) {
    if (map-&gt;map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
      map-&gt;unmap_ops[i].handle = map-&gt;map_ops[i].handle;
      if (!use_ptemod)
        alloced++;
    }
    if (use_ptemod) {
      if (map-&gt;kmap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
        if (map-&gt;map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay)
          alloced++;
        map-&gt;kunmap_ops[i].handle = map-&gt;kmap_ops[i].handle;
      }
    }
  }
  ...
  atomic_add(alloced, &amp;amp;map-&gt;live_grants);

Assume that use_ptemod is true (i.e., the domain mapping the granted
pages is a paravirtualized domain). In the code excerpt above, note that
the "alloced" variable is only incremented when both kmap_ops[i].status
and map_ops[i].status are set to GNTST_okay (i.e., both mapping
operations are successful).  However, as also noted above, there are
cases where a grant mapping operation fails partially, breaking the
assumption of the code excerpt above.

The aforementioned causes map-&gt;live_grants to be incorrectly set. In
some cases, all of the map_ops mappings fail, but all of the kmap_ops
mappings succeed, meaning that live_grants may remain zero. This in turn
makes it impossible to unmap the successfully grant-mapped pages pointed
to by kmap_ops, because unmap_grant_pages has the following snippet of
code at its beginning:

  if (atomic_read(&amp;amp;map-&gt;live_grants) == 0)
    return; /* Nothing to do */

In other cases where only some of the map_ops mappings fail but all
kmap_ops mappings succeed, live_grants is made positive, but when the
user requests unmapping the grant-mapped pages, __unmap_grant_pages_done
will then make map-&gt;live_grants negative, because the latter function
does not check if all of the pages that were requested to be unmapped
were actually unmapped, and the same function unconditionally subtracts
"data-&gt;count" (i.e., a value that can be greater than map-&gt;live_grants)
from map-&gt;live_grants. The side effects of a negative live_grants value
have not been studied.

The net effect of all of this is that grant references are leaked in one
of the above conditions. In Qubes OS v4.1 (which uses Xen's grant
mechanism extensively for X11 GUI isolation), this issue manifests
itself with warning messages like the following to be printed out by the
Linux kernel in the VM that had granted pages (that contain X11 GUI
window data) to dom0: "g.e. 0x1234 still pending", especially after the
user rapidly resizes GUI VM windows (causing some grant-mapping
operations to partially or completely fail, due to the fact that the VM
unshares some of the pages as part of the window resizing, making the
pages impossible to grant-map from dom0).

The fix for this issue involves counting all successful map_ops and
kmap_ops mappings separately, and then adding the sum to live_grants.
During unmapping, only the number of successfully unmapped grants is
subtracted from live_grants. The code is also modified to check for
negative live_grants values after the subtraction and warn the user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50258 | wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential stack-out-of-bounds in brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50258</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential stack-out-of-bounds in brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds()

This patch fixes a stack-out-of-bounds read in brcmfmac that occurs
when 'buf' that is not null-terminated is passed as an argument of
strsep() in brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds(). This buffer is filled with a firmware
version string by memcpy() in brcmf_fil_iovar_data_get().
The patch ensures buf is null-terminated.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

drm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent

Drivers' .remove and .shutdown callbacks are executed on different code
paths. The former is called when a device is removed from the bus, while
the latter is called at system shutdown time to quiesce the device.

This means that some overlap exists between the two, because both have to
take care of properly shutting down the hardware. But currently the logic
used in these two callbacks isn't consistent in msm drivers, which could
lead to kernel panic.

For example, on .remove the component is deleted and its .unbind callback
leads to the hardware being shutdown but only if the DRM device has been
marked as registered.

That check doesn't exist in the .shutdown logic and this can lead to the
driver calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() for a DRM device that hasn't
been properly initialized.

A situation like this can happen if drivers for expected sub-devices fail
to probe, since the .bind callback will never be executed. If that is the
case, drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() will attempt to take mutexes that are
only initialized if drm_mode_config_init() is called during a device bind.

This bug was attempted to be fixed in commit 623f279c7781 ("drm/msm: fix
shutdown hook in case GPU components failed to bind"), but unfortunately
it still happens in some cases as the one mentioned above, i.e:

  systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.

drm/sti: Fix return type of sti_{dvo,hda,hdmi}_connector_mode_valid()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/gpu/drm/sti/sti_hda.c:637:16: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'enum drm_mode_status (*)(struct drm_connector *, struct drm_display_mode *)' with an expression of type 'int (struct drm_connector *, struct drm_display_mode *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]

sti_{dvo,hda,hdmi}_connector_mode_valid() to match the prototype's to
resolve the warning and CFI failure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53147 | xfrm: add NULL check in xfrm_update_ae_params</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53147</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal

In a setup where a Thunderbolt hub connects to Ethernet and a display
through USB Type-C, users may experience a hung task timeout when they
remove the cable between the PC and the Thunderbolt hub.
This is because the igb_down function is called multiple times when
the Thunderbolt hub is unplugged. For example, the igb_io_error_detected
triggers the first call, and the igb_remove triggers the second call.
The second call to igb_down will block at napi_synchronize.
Here's the call trace:

In this case, igb_io_error_detected detaches the network interface
and requests a PCIE slot reset, however, the PCIE reset callback is
not being invoked and thus the Ethernet connection breaks down.
As the PCIE error in this case is a non-fatal one, requesting a
slot reset can be avoided.
This patch fixes the task hung issue and preserves Ethernet
connection by ignoring non-fatal PCIE errors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53149 | ext4: avoid deadlock in fs reclaim with page writeback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53149</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid deadlock in fs reclaim with page writeback

Ext4 has a filesystem wide lock protecting ext4_writepages() calls to
avoid races with switching of journalled data flag or inode format. This
lock can however cause a deadlock like:

CPU0                            CPU1

ext4_writepages()
  percpu_down_read(sbi-&gt;s_writepages_rwsem);
                                ext4_change_inode_journal_flag()
                                  percpu_down_write(sbi-&gt;s_writepages_rwsem);
                                    - blocks, all readers block from now on
  ext4_do_writepages()
    ext4_init_io_end()
      kmem_cache_zalloc(io_end_cachep, GFP_KERNEL)
        fs_reclaim frees dentry...
          dentry_unlink_inode()
            iput() - last ref =&gt;
              iput_final() - inode dirty =&gt;
                write_inode_now()...
                  ext4_writepages() tries to acquire sbi-&gt;s_writepages_rwsem
                    and blocks forever

Make sure we cannot recurse into filesystem reclaim from writeback code
to avoid the deadlock.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53150 | scsi: qla2xxx: Pointer may be dereferenced</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes

Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing
writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many
writes can cause soft lockup.

Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for
raid10 with ramdisks:

Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.

Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,
in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of
memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53152 | drm/amdgpu: fix calltrace warning in amddrm_buddy_fini</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53152</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: bq25890: Fix external_power_changed race

bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() dereferences bq-&gt;charger,
which gets sets in bq25890_power_supply_init() like this:

  bq-&gt;charger = devm_power_supply_register(bq-&gt;dev, &amp;amp;bq-&gt;desc, &amp;amp;psy_cfg);

As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
where bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() may get called while
bq-&gt;charger has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

This race hits during boot sometimes on a Lenovo Yoga Book 1 yb1-x90f
when the cht_wcove_pwrsrc (extcon) power_supply is done with detecting
the connected charger-type which happens to exactly hit the small window:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018

Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
the power_supply which will eventually get stored in bq-&gt;charger,
so bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
the passed in psy argument which is always valid.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53167 | tracing: Fix null pointer dereference in tracing_err_log_open()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53167</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If we then use 'lseek' on that opened file, 'seq_lseek' dereferences
'file-&gt;private_data' in 'mutex_lock(&amp;amp;m-&gt;lock)', resulting in a kernel panic.

usb: ucsi_acpi: Increase the command completion timeout

Commit 130a96d698d7 ("usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Increase command

to 60 seconds due to issues related to alternate mode discovery.

After the alternate mode discovery switch to polled mode
the timeout was reduced, but instead of being set back to
5 seconds it was reduced to 1 second.

This is causing problems when using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 yoga gen7
connected over Type-C to a LG 27UL850-W (charging DP over Type-C).

When the monitor is already connected at boot the following error
is logged: "PPM init failed (-110)", /sys/class/typec is empty and
on unplugging the NULL pointer deref fixed earlier in this series
happens.

When the monitor is connected after boot the following error
is logged instead: "GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS failed (-110)".

Setting the timeout back to 5 seconds fixes both cases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53169 | x86/resctrl: Clear staged_config[] before and after it is used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53169</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

0xca0 in this scenario.

Fix it by clearing staged_config[] before and after it is used.

vfio/type1: prevent underflow of locked_vm via exec()

When a vfio container is preserved across exec, the task does not change,
but it gets a new mm with locked_vm=0, and loses the count from existing
dma mappings.  If the user later unmaps a dma mapping, locked_vm underflows
to a large unsigned value, and a subsequent dma map request fails with
ENOMEM in __account_locked_vm.

To avoid underflow, grab and save the mm at the time a dma is mapped.
Use that mm when adjusting locked_vm, rather than re-acquiring the saved
task's mm, which may have changed.  If the saved mm is dead, do nothing.

locked_vm is incremented for existing mappings in a subsequent patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53172 | fsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53172</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds

Commit 56124d6c87fd ("fsverity: support enabling with tree block size &lt;
PAGE_SIZE") changed FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to use __kernel_read() to read
the file's data, instead of direct pagecache accesses.

An unintended consequence of this is that the
'WARN_ON_ONCE(!(file-&gt;f_mode &amp; FMODE_READ))' in __kernel_read() became
reachable by fuzz tests.  This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called
on a fd opened with access mode 3, which means "ioctl access only".

Arguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only fds.  But
ioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that
few people even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY
even specifically says it requires O_RDONLY.)  It's probably not
worthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just to handle
this case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53173 | tty: pcn_uart: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53173</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250: Reinit port-&gt;pm on port specific driver unbind

When we unbind a serial port hardware specific 8250 driver, the generic
serial8250 driver takes over the port. After that we see an oops about 10
seconds later. This can produce the following at least on some TI SoCs:

Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406)
Internal error: : 1406 [#1] SMP ARM

Turns out that we may still have the serial port hardware specific driver
port-&gt;pm in use, and serial8250_pm() tries to call it after the port
specific driver is gone:

serial8250_pm [8250_base] from uart_change_pm+0x54/0x8c [serial_base]
uart_change_pm [serial_base] from uart_hangup+0x154/0x198 [serial_base]

do_exit from do_group_exit+0x40/0x8c
do_group_exit from __wake_up_parent+0x0/0x1c

Let's fix the issue by calling serial8250_set_defaults() in
serial8250_unregister_port(). This will set the port back to using
the serial8250 default functions, and sets the port-&gt;pm to point to
serial8250_pm.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53177 | media: hi846: fix usage of pm_runtime_get_if_in_use()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53177</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: fix zswap writeback race condition

The zswap writeback mechanism can cause a race condition resulting in
memory corruption, where a swapped out page gets swapped in with data that
was written to a different page.

The race unfolds like this:
1. a page with data A and swap offset X is stored in zswap
2. page A is removed off the LRU by zpool driver for writeback in
   zswap-shrink work, data for A is mapped by zpool driver
3. user space program faults and invalidates page entry A, offset X is
   considered free
4. kswapd stores page B at offset X in zswap (zswap could also be
   full, if so, page B would then be IOed to X, then skip step 5.)
5. entry A is replaced by B in tree-&gt;rbroot, this doesn't affect the
   local reference held by zswap-shrink work
6. zswap-shrink work writes back A at X, and frees zswap entry A
7. swapin of slot X brings A in memory instead of B

The fix:
Once the swap page cache has been allocated (case ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NEW),
zswap-shrink work just checks that the local zswap_entry reference is
still the same as the one in the tree.  If it's not the same it means that
it's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is
aborted because the local entry contains stale data.

Reproducer:
I originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work
on the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test
machine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so
whatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do
the trick.

In order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of
available memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1
--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens
of minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging
/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20
and 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set
`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't
realize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the
same data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53179 | netfilter: ipset: add the missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro for ip_set_hash_netportnet.c</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53179</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

[CAUSE]
The root cause of the triggered ASSERT() is we can have a race between
quota tree creation and relocation.

This leads us to create a duplicated quota tree in the
btrfs_read_fs_root() path, and since it's treated as fs tree, it would
have ROOT_SHAREABLE flag, causing us to create a reloc tree for it.

The bug itself is fixed by a dedicated patch for it, but this already
taught us the ASSERT() is not something straightforward for
developers.

[ENHANCEMENT]
Instead of using an ASSERT(), let's handle it gracefully and output
extra info about the mismatch reloc roots to help debug.

Also with the above ASSERT() removed, we can trigger ASSERT(0)s inside
merge_reloc_roots() later.
Also replace those ASSERT(0)s with WARN_ON()s.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53184 | arm64/sme: Set new vector length before reallocating</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53184</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sme: Set new vector length before reallocating

As part of fixing the allocation of the buffer for SVE state when changing
SME vector length we introduced an immediate reallocation of the SVE state,
this is also done when changing the SVE vector length for consistency.
Unfortunately this reallocation is done prior to writing the new vector
length to the task struct, meaning the allocation is done with the old
vector length and can lead to memory corruption due to an undersized buffer
being used.

Move the update of the vector length before the allocation to ensure that
the new vector length is taken into account.

For some reason this isn't triggering any problems when running tests on
the arm64 fixes branch (even after repeated tries) but is triggering
issues very often after merge into mainline.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53185 | wifi: ath9k: don&amp;#x27;t allow to overwrite ENDPOINT0 attributes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53185</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

skbuff: Fix a race between coalescing and releasing SKBs

Commit 1effe8ca4e34 ("skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment
recycling") allowed coalescing to proceed with non page pool page and page
pool page when @from is cloned, i.e.

to-&gt;pp_recycle    --&gt; false
from-&gt;pp_recycle  --&gt; true
skb_cloned(from)  --&gt; true

However, it actually requires skb_cloned(@from) to hold true until
coalescing finishes in this situation. If the other cloned SKB is
released while the merging is in process, from_shinfo-&gt;nr_frags will be
set to 0 toward the end of the function, causing the increment of frag
page _refcount to be unexpectedly skipped resulting in inconsistent
reference counts. Later when SKB(@to) is released, it frees the page
directly even though the page pool page is still in use, leading to
use-after-free or double-free errors. So it should be prohibited.

The double-free error message below prompted us to investigate:

btrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused

If a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused
before we finish its creation, at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),
then when btrfs_mark_bg_unused() is called against the block group, we
assume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to
reclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the
list of unused block groups. This has two consequences:

1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the
   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and
   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find
   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),
   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the
   deletion to fail due to the missing items;

2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we
   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the
   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that
   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block
   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra
   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This
   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when
   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the
   reference count to 0.

This second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which
produced the following assertion failure and stack trace:

net: openvswitch: fix race on port output

assume the following setup on a single machine:
1. An openvswitch instance with one bridge and default flows
2. two network namespaces "server" and "client"
3. two ovs interfaces "server" and "client" on the bridge
4. for each ovs interface a veth pair with a matching name and 32 rx and
   tx queues
5. move the ends of the veth pairs to the respective network namespaces
6. assign ip addresses to each of the veth ends in the namespaces (needs
   to be the same subnet)
7. start some http server on the server network namespace
8. test if a client in the client namespace can reach the http server

when following the actions below the host has a chance of getting a cpu
stuck in a infinite loop:
1. send a large amount of parallel requests to the http server (around
   3000 curls should work)
2. in parallel delete the network namespace (do not delete interfaces or
   stop the server, just kill the namespace)

there is a low chance that this will cause the below kernel cpu stuck
message. If this does not happen just retry.
Below there is also the output of bpftrace for the functions mentioned
in the output.

The series of events happening here is:
1. the network namespace is deleted calling
   `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` somewhere in the process
2. this sets first `NETREG_UNREGISTERING` on both ends of the veth and
   then runs `synchronize_net`
3. it then calls `call_netdevice_notifiers` with `NETDEV_UNREGISTER`
4. this is then handled by `dp_device_event` which calls
   `ovs_netdev_detach_dev` (if a vport is found, which is the case for
   the veth interface attached to ovs)
5. this removes the rx_handlers of the device but does not prevent
   packages to be sent to the device
6. `dp_device_event` then queues the vport deletion to work in
   background as a ovs_lock is needed that we do not hold in the
   unregistration path
7. `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` continues to call
   `netdev_unregister_kobject` which sets `real_num_tx_queues` to 0
8. port deletion continues (but details are not relevant for this issue)
9. at some future point the background task deletes the vport

If after 7. but before 9. a packet is send to the ovs vport (which is
not deleted at this point in time) which forwards it to the
`dev_queue_xmit` flow even though the device is unregistering.
In `skb_tx_hash` (which is called in the `dev_queue_xmit`) path there is
a while loop (if the packet has a rx_queue recorded) that is infinite if
`dev-&gt;real_num_tx_queues` is zero.

To prevent this from happening we update `do_output` to handle devices
without carrier the same as if the device is not found (which would
be the code path after 9. is done).

Additionally we now produce a warning in `skb_tx_hash` if we will hit
the infinite loop.

There is a time gap in [1], during which if the pending rs_timer
becomes not pending. It will miss to hold idev, but the rs_timer
is activated. Thus rs_timer callback function addrconf_rs_timer()
will be executed and put idev later without holding idev. A refcount
underflow issue for idev can be caused by this.

The leaks can be reproduced by annotating gro_cells_init() with

vxlan: Fix nexthop hash size

The nexthop code expects a 31 bit hash, such as what is returned by
fib_multipath_hash() and rt6_multipath_hash(). Passing the 32 bit hash
returned by skb_get_hash() can lead to problems related to the fact that
'int hash' is a negative number when the MSB is set.

In the case of hash threshold nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_hthr()
will disproportionately select the first nexthop group entry. In the case
of resilient nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_res() may do an out of
bounds access in nh_buckets[], for example:
    hash = -912054133
    num_nh_buckets = 2
    bucket_index = 65535

which leads to the following panic:

drm/amdgpu: fix amdgpu_irq_put call trace in gmc_v10_0_hw_fini

The gmc.ecc_irq is enabled by firmware per IFWI setting,
and the host driver is not privileged to enable/disable
the interrupt. So, it is meaningless to use the amdgpu_irq_put

memory leak.

USB: uhci: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()

When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,
otherwise the memory will leak over time.  To make things simpler, just
call debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logic
at once.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:15:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53198 | raw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53198</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

raw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().

Dae R. Jeong reported a NULL deref in raw_get_next() [0].

It seems that the repro was running these sequences in parallel so
that one thread was iterating on a socket that was being freed in
another netns.

  unshare(0x40060200)
  r0 = syz_open_procfs(0x0, &amp;(0x7f0000002080)='net/raw\x00')
  socket$inet_icmp_raw(0x2, 0x3, 0x1)
  pread64(r0, &amp;(0x7f0000000000)=""/10, 0xa, 0x10000000007f)

After commit 0daf07e52709 ("raw: convert raw sockets to RCU"), we
use RCU and hlist_nulls_for_each_entry() to iterate over SOCK_RAW
sockets.  However, we should use spinlock for slow paths to avoid
the NULL deref.

Also, SOCK_RAW does not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, and the slab object
is not reused during iteration in the grace period.  In fact, the
lockless readers do not check the nulls marker with get_nulls_value().
So, SOCK_RAW should use hlist instead of hlist_nulls.

Instead of adding an unnecessary barrier by sk_nulls_for_each_rcu(),
let's convert hlist_nulls to hlist and use sk_for_each_rcu() for
fast paths and sk_for_each() and spinlock for /proc/net/raw.

If we find an unexpected generation for the extent buffer we are cloning
at btrfs_copy_root(), we just WARN_ON() and don't error out and abort the
transaction, meaning we allow to persist metadata with an unexpected
generation. Instead of warning only, abort the transaction and return

usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts

This commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeout
which causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabled
and unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled.
It is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases.
The following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:

1. Connect
   =======
-&gt;dwc3_thread_interrupt
 -&gt;dwc3_ep0_interrupt
  -&gt;configfs_composite_setup
   -&gt;composite_setup
    -&gt;usb_ep_queue
     -&gt;dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
      -&gt;__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
       -&gt;__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data
        -&gt;dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

2. Disconnect
   ==========
-&gt;dwc3_thread_interrupt
 -&gt;dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt
  -&gt;dwc3_ep0_reset_state
   -&gt;dwc3_ep0_end_control_data
    -&gt;dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

In the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that control
transfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and end
transfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence and
processing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout.
This maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EP
commands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better to
remove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to
avoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39802 | lib/crypto: arm/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39802</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/crypto: arm/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts

Restore the SIMD usability check that was removed by commit 773426f4771b
("crypto: arm/poly1305 - Add block-only interface").

This safety check is cheap and is well worth eliminating a footgun.
While the Poly1305 functions should not be called when SIMD registers
are unusable, if they are anyway, they should just do the right thing
instead of corrupting random tasks' registers and/or computing incorrect
MACs.  Fixing this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.

Just use may_use_simd() instead of the original crypto_simd_usable(),
since poly1305_kunit won't rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39803 | scsi: ufs: core: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE() call from ufshcd_uic_cmd_compl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39803</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The UIC completion interrupt may be disabled while an UIC command is

interrupt is triggered and the WARN_ON_ONCE(!cmd) statement is hit.
Hence this patch that removes this kernel warning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:05:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39804 | lib/crypto: arm64/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39804</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
