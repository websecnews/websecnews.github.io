It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function save_users of the file admin/user/index.php. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 03:42:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7589 | OpenSSH pre-authentication async signal safety issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7589</link><description>A signal handler in sshd(8) may call a logging function that is not async-signal-safe.  The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.

This issue is another instance of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in this case is from the integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD.

As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code execution as root.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 03:20:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7660 | SourceCodester File Manager App Add File cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7660</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester File Manager App 1.0 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component Add File Handler. The manipulation of the argument File Title/Uploaded By leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 03:20:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6640 | pf incorrectly matches different ICMPv6 states in the state table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6640</link><description>In ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND), the ID is always 0.  When pf is configured to allow ND and block incoming Echo Requests, a crafted Echo Request packet after a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) can trigger an Echo Reply.  The packet has to come from the same host as the NS and have a zero as identifier to match the state created by the Neighbor Discovery and allow replies to be generated.

ICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall rules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going to create a state in the state table.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6759 | NFS client accepts file names containing path separators</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6759</link><description>When mounting a remote filesystem using NFS, the kernel did not sanitize remotely provided filenames for the path separator character, "/".  This allows readdir(3) and related functions to return filesystem entries with names containing additional path components.

The lack of validation described above gives rise to a confused deputy problem.  For example, a program copying files from an NFS mount could be tricked into copying from outside the intended source directory, and/or to a location outside the intended destination directory.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6760 | ktrace(2) fails to detach when executing a setuid binary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6760</link><description>A logic bug in the code which disables kernel tracing for setuid programs meant that tracing was not disabled when it should have, allowing unprivileged users to trace and inspect the behavior of setuid programs.

The bug may be used by an unprivileged user to read the contents of files to which they would not otherwise have access, such as the local password database.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 02:47:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7659 | projectsend Password Reset Token functions.php generate_random_string random values</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7659</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in projectsend up to r1605.

Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHAB's CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 18:09:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42470 | CometVisu Backend for openHAB has a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42470</link><description>openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu.

Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file. Version 3.10.2 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 17:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31315 | Improper validation in a model specific register (MSR) could allow a malicious program with ring0 access to modify SMM configuration while S...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31315</link><description>Improper validation in a model specific register (MSR) could allow a malicious program with ring0 access to modify SMM configuration while SMI lock is enabled, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 17:21:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32765 | QTS, QuTS hero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32765</link><description>A vulnerability has been reported to affect Network &amp; Virtual Switch.

This vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker, without an account in the application, to import their own database file, leading to the deletion or spoofing of the existing `anythingllm.db` file. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can serve malicious data to users or collect information about them. The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly restrict access to the data-import functionality, allowing unauthorized database manipulation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:42:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7512 | Stored XSS in Board instances</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7512</link><description>Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability inÂ Board instances.
