Prior to 0.0.16, due to a bug in sandboxing logic, sandbox-runtime did not properly enforce a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains. This could allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox. A patch for this was released in v0.0.16.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:21:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55948 | This vulnerability fundamentally arises from yzcheng90 X-SpringBoot 6.0's implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) through dual de...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55948</link><description>This vulnerability fundamentally arises from yzcheng90 X-SpringBoot 6.0's implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) through dual dependency on frontend menu systems and backend permission tables, without enforcing atomic synchronization between these components. The critical flaw manifests when frontend menu updates (such as privilege revocation) fail to propagate to the backend permission table in real-time, creating a dangerous desynchronization. While users lose access to restricted functions through the web interface (as UI elements properly disappear), the stale permission records still validate unauthorized API requests when accessed directly through tools like Postman. Attackers exploiting this inconsistency can perform privileged operations including but not limited to: creating high-permission user accounts, accessing sensitive data beyond their clearance level, and executing admin-level commands.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65959 | Open WebUI vulnerable to Stored DOM XSS via Note &amp;#x27;Download PDF&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65959</link><description>Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to 0.6.37, a Stored XSS vulnerability was discovered in Open-WebUI's Notes PDF download functionality. An attacker can import a Markdown file containing malicious SVG tags into Notes, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and steal session tokens when a victim downloads the note as PDF. This vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user, and unauthenticated external attackers can steal session tokens from users (both admin and regular users) by sharing specially crafted markdown files. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.37.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66574 | TranzAxis 3.2.41.10.26 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66574</link><description>TranzAxis 3.2.41.10.26 allows authenticated users to inject cross-site scripting via the `Open Object in Tree` endpoint, allowing attackers to steal session cookies and potentially escalate privileges.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66575 | VeeVPN 1.6.1 - Unquoted Service Path Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66575</link><description>VeeVPN 1.6.1 contains an unquoted service path vulnerability in the VeePNService that allows remote attackers to execute code during startup or reboot with escalated privileges.

This issue has been patched in versions 3.2.3 and 4.0.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 18:51:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13488 | Nexus Repository 3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13488</link><description>Due to a regression introduced in version 3.83.0, a security header is no longer applied to certain user-uploaded content served from repositories.

This CVE covers the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988. However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. 

First, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to &gt;= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. 

Second, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the "org.apache.tika:tika-parsers" module.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40246 | xfs: fix out of bounds memory read error in symlink repair</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40246</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

 ==================================================================

On further analysis, I realized that the second parameter to min() is
not correct.  xfs_ifork::if_bytes is the size of the xfs_ifork::if_data
buffer.  if_bytes can be smaller than the data fork size because:

(a) the forkoff code tries to keep the data area as large as possible
(b) for symbolic links, if_bytes is the ondisk file size + 1
(c) forkoff is always a multiple of 8.

Case in point: for a single-byte symlink target, forkoff will be
8 but the buffer will only be 2 bytes long.

In other words, the logic here is wrong and we walk off the end of the
incore buffer.  Fix that.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40247 | drm/msm: Fix pgtable prealloc error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40247</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Since msm_vma_job_free() is called directly from the ioctl, this looks
like an error path cleanup issue.  Which I think results from
prealloc_cleanup() called without a preceding successful
prealloc_allocate() call.  So handle that case better.

vsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established

During connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already
established socket leads to several issues:

1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() -&gt;
   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking
   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated
   `vvs-&gt;bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.

2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket
   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap
   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.

3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -&gt; SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a
   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for
   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a
   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.

Do not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected
sockets: they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by
sendmsg().

gpio: cdev: make sure the cdev fd is still active before emitting events

With the final call to fput() on a file descriptor, the release action
may be deferred and scheduled on a work queue. The reference count of
that descriptor is still zero and it must not be used. It's possible
that a GPIO change, we want to notify the user-space about, happens
AFTER the reference count on the file descriptor associated with the
character device went down to zero but BEFORE the .release() callback
was called from the workqueue and so BEFORE we unregistered from the
notifier.

Using the regular get_file() routine in this situation triggers the
following warning:

  struct file::f_count incremented from zero; use-after-free condition present!

So use the get_file_active() variant that will return NULL on file
descriptors that have been or are being released.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40250 | net/mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40250</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure

The mlx5_irq_alloc() function can inadvertently free the entire rmap
and end up in a crash[1] when the other threads tries to access this,
when request_irq() fails due to exhausted IRQ vectors. This commit
modifies the cleanup to remove only the specific IRQ mapping that was
just added.

This prevents removal of other valid mappings and ensures precise
cleanup of the failed IRQ allocation's associated glue object.

Note: This error is observed when both fwctl and rds configs are enabled.

devlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy

The function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to "Unset parent for
all rate objects". However, it was only calling the driver-specific
`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing
the parent's refcount, without actually setting the
`devlink_rate-&gt;parent` pointer to NULL.

This leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause
refcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is
inconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,
where the parent pointer is correctly cleared.

This patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate-&gt;parent`
to NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's
documented behavior for all rate objects.

net: qlogic/qede: fix potential out-of-bounds read in qede_tpa_cont() and qede_tpa_end()

The loops in 'qede_tpa_cont()' and 'qede_tpa_end()', iterate
over 'cqe-&gt;len_list[]' using only a zero-length terminator as
the stopping condition. If the terminator was missing or
malformed, the loop could run past the end of the fixed-size array.

Add an explicit bound check using ARRAY_SIZE() in both loops to prevent
a potential out-of-bounds access.

net: openvswitch: remove never-working support for setting nsh fields

The validation of the set(nsh(...)) action is completely wrong.
It runs through the nsh_key_put_from_nlattr() function that is the
same function that validates NSH keys for the flow match and the
push_nsh() action.  However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different
memory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in
case of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.

There is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that
says that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both
the value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value
we're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to
write into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during
validation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it:

The third issue with this process is that while trying to convert
the non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles
the size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested
attributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling
them in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed
during the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during
the flow dump.

In the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are
either validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone
manages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely
not do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are
mixed up.

Fixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing
most of the validation code.

Given that and the fact that this functionality never worked since
introduction, let's just remove it altogether.  It's better to
re-introduce it later with a proper implementation instead of trying
to fix it in stable releases.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40255 | net: core: prevent NULL deref in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40255</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: core: prevent NULL deref in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()

The ethtool tsconfig Netlink path can trigger a null pointer
dereference. A call chain such as:

  tsconfig_prepare_data() -&gt;
  dev_get_hwtstamp_phylib() -&gt;
  vlan_hwtstamp_get() -&gt;
  generic_hwtstamp_get_lower() -&gt;
  generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()

results in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower() being called with
kernel_cfg-&gt;ifr as NULL.

The generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower() function does not expect
a NULL ifr and dereferences it, leading to a system crash.

Fix this by adding a NULL check for kernel_cfg-&gt;ifr in
generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower(). If ifr is NULL, return -EINVAL.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40256 | xfrm: also call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40256</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: also call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added

In commit b441cf3f8c4b ("xfrm: delete x-&gt;tunnel as we delete x"), I
missed the case where state creation fails between full
initialization (-&gt;init_state has been called) and being inserted on
the lists.

In this situation, -&gt;init_state has been called, so for IPcomp
tunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the
lists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before
that. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we
don't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up
leaking the FB tunnel.

There are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in
both net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,
xfrm_state_migrate). A "proper" rollback of the init_state work would
probably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets
more complicated as multiple states may be involved.

At some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call
xfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states
will have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,
which solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)
aimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the
lists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&amp;amp;xfrm_state_gc_work).</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40257 | mptcp: fix a race in mptcp_pm_del_add_timer()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40257</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix race condition in mptcp_schedule_work()

syzbot reported use-after-free in mptcp_schedule_work() [1]

Issue here is that mptcp_schedule_work() schedules a work,
then gets a refcount on sk-&gt;sk_refcnt if the work was scheduled.
This refcount will be released by mptcp_worker().

[A] if (schedule_work(...)) {
[B]     sock_hold(sk);
        return true;
    }

Problem is that mptcp_worker() can run immediately and complete before [B]

We need instead :

    sock_hold(sk);
    if (schedule_work(...))
        return true;
    sock_put(sk);

[1]
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

scsi: sg: Do not sleep in atomic context

sg_finish_rem_req() calls blk_rq_unmap_user(). The latter function may
sleep. Hence, call sg_finish_rem_req() with interrupts enabled instead
of disabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40260 | sched_ext: Fix scx_enable() crash on helper kthread creation failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40260</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: Fix scx_enable() crash on helper kthread creation failure

A crash was observed when the sched_ext selftests runner was
terminated with Ctrl+\ while test 15 was running:

NIP [c00000000028fa58] scx_enable.constprop.0+0x358/0x12b0

kthread_run_worker() returns an ERR_PTR() on failure rather than NULL,
but the current code in scx_alloc_and_add_sched() only checks for a NULL
helper. Incase of failure on SIGQUIT, the error is not handled in
scx_alloc_and_add_sched() and scx_enable() ends up dereferencing an
error pointer.

Error handling is fixed in scx_alloc_and_add_sched() to propagate
PTR_ERR() into ret, so that scx_enable() jumps to the existing error
path, avoiding random dereference on failure.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40261 | nvme: nvme-fc: Ensure -&amp;gt;ioerr_work is cancelled in nvme_fc_delete_ctrl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40261</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: nvme-fc: Ensure -&gt;ioerr_work is cancelled in nvme_fc_delete_ctrl()

nvme_fc_delete_assocation() waits for pending I/O to complete before
returning, and an error can cause -&gt;ioerr_work to be queued after
cancel_work_sync() had been called.  Move the call to cancel_work_sync() to
be after nvme_fc_delete_association() to ensure -&gt;ioerr_work is not running
when the nvme_fc_ctrl object is freed.  Otherwise the following can occur:

tty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling

The receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other
SCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory
offset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index
into the sci_port_params-&gt;regs array, as mentioned above the
sci_serial_in() function.

For RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call
inside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the
bounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified
by SCI_NR_REGS.

Because of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's
rsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,
happens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when
sci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the
supported register sizes.

The existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because
SCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not
present in the regs array.

Avoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard
register handling.

Use the ops-&gt;read_reg() and ops-&gt;write_reg() functions to properly read
and write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable
to accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.

sci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the
sci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used
for RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.

most: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect

hdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually
unregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface-&gt;dev).
If that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()
immediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.

The old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in
hdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.
Depending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or
double-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also
performed puts).

Fix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),
so they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by
dropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are
redundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().

This addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in
hdm_disconnect().

drm/panthor: Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region

This commit address a kernel panic issue that can happen if Userspace
tries to partially unmap a GPU virtual region (aka drm_gpuva).
The VM_BIND interface allows partial unmapping of a BO.

Panthor driver pre-allocates memory for the new drm_gpuva structures
that would be needed for the map/unmap operation, done using drm_gpuvm
layer. It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap
but a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it
ended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.

Following dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.

mm: prevent poison consumption when splitting THP

When performing memory error injection on a THP (Transparent Huge Page)
mapped to userspace on an x86 server, the kernel panics with the following
trace.  The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead
of panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an
in-userspace #MC.

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134
  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10: {memchr_inv+0x4c/0xf0}

  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check

The root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered
by an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting
process employs a mechanism, implemented in
try_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to
identify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results
in a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()
completes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.  See the kernel panic
call trace on the two #MCs.

  First Machine Check occurs // [1]
    memory_failure()         // [2]

                        Second Machine Check occurs  // [6]
                          Kernel panic

[1] Triggered by accessing a hardware-poisoned THP in userspace, which is
    typically recoverable by terminating the affected process.

[2] Call folio_set_has_hwpoisoned() before try_to_split_thp_page().

[3] Pass the RMP_USE_SHARED_ZEROPAGE remap flag to remap_page().

[4] Try to map the unused THP to zeropage.

[5] Re-access pages in the hw-poisoned THP in the kernel.

[6] Triggered in-kernel, leading to a panic kernel.

In Step[2], memory_failure() sets the poisoned flag on the page in the THP
by TestSetPageHWPoison() before calling try_to_split_thp_page().

As suggested by David Hildenbrand, fix this panic by not accessing to the
poisoned page in the THP during zeropage identification, while continuing
to scan unaffected pages in the THP for possible zeropage mapping.  This
prevents a second in-kernel #MC that would cause kernel panic in Step[4].

vsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()

Syzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between
vsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.

The issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b ("vsock: Fix
transport_* TOCTOU") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in
vsock_assign_transport() around the transport-&gt;release() call, that can
call vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock
held. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and
re-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold
vsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular
dependency is created.

Fix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling
transport-&gt;release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe
because we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the
old transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by
obtaining a module reference first via try_module_get().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40232 | rv: Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40232</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: clear extent cache after moving/defragmenting extents

The extent map cache can become stale when extents are moved or
defragmented, causing subsequent operations to see outdated extent flags. 
This triggers a BUG_ON in ocfs2_refcount_cal_cow_clusters().

The problem occurs when:
1. copy_file_range() creates a reflinked extent with OCFS2_EXT_REFCOUNTED
2. ioctl(FITRIM) triggers ocfs2_move_extents()
3. __ocfs2_move_extents_range() reads and caches the extent (flags=0x2)
4. ocfs2_move_extent()/ocfs2_defrag_extent() calls __ocfs2_move_extent()
   which clears OCFS2_EXT_REFCOUNTED flag on disk (flags=0x0)
5. The extent map cache is not invalidated after the move
6. Later write() operations read stale cached flags (0x2) but disk has
   updated flags (0x0), causing a mismatch
7. BUG_ON(!(rec-&gt;e_flags &amp; OCFS2_EXT_REFCOUNTED)) triggers

Fix by clearing the extent map cache after each extent move/defrag
operation in __ocfs2_move_extents_range().  This ensures subsequent
operations read fresh extent data from disk.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40234 | platform/x86: alienware-wmi-wmax: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sleep handlers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40234</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix it by protecting calling exportfs_encode_fid() from

net/mlx5: Fix IPsec cleanup over MPV device

When we do mlx5e_detach_netdev() we eventually disable blocking events
notifier, among those events are IPsec MPV events from IB to core.

So before disabling those blocking events, make sure to also unregister
the devcom device and mark all this device operations as complete,
in order to prevent the other device from using invalid netdev
during future devcom events which could cause the trace below.

net: phy: micrel: always set shared-&gt;phydev for LAN8814

Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared-&gt;phydev is only set if PTP
clock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting
it.

This is an issue as shared-&gt;phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ
is being handled, especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was
not set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.

So, simply always set shared-&gt;phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40240 | sctp: avoid NULL dereference when chunk data buffer is missing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40240</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

chunk-&gt;skb can only be NULL if chunk-&gt;head_skb is not. Check for frag_list

erofs: fix crafted invalid cases for encoded extents

Robert recently reported two corrupted images that can cause system
crashes, which are related to the new encoded extents introduced
in Linux 6.15:

  - The first one [1] has plen != 0 (e.g. plen == 0x2000000) but
    (plen &amp; Z_EROFS_EXTENT_PLEN_MASK) == 0. It is used to represent
    special extents such as sparse extents (!EROFS_MAP_MAPPED), but
    previously only plen == 0 was handled;

  - The second one [2] has pa 0xffffffffffdcffed and plen 0xb4000,
    then "cur [0xfffffffffffff000] += bvec.bv_len [0x1000]" in
    "} while ((cur += bvec.bv_len) &lt; end);" wraps around, causing an
    out-of-bound access of pcl-&gt;compressed_bvecs[] in
    z_erofs_submit_queue().  EROFS only supports 48-bit physical block
    addresses (up to 1EiB for 4k blocks), so add a sanity check to
    enforce this.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40242 | gfs2: Fix unlikely race in gdlm_put_lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40242</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

=====================================================

The HFS_SB(sb)-&gt;bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():

HFS_SB(sb)-&gt;bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);

Finally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()
doesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains
only zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.
But if the allocated memory contains the "garbage", then
it can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers
the reported issue.

This patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()
with the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.
Because, newly created allocation bitmap should have all
available blocks free. Potentially, initialization bitmap's read
operation could not fill the whole allocated memory and
"garbage" in the not initialized memory will be the reason of

nios2: ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits

On nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM set, the kernel relies on
memblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map, in
particular for max_low_pfn.
Unfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized to
MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading
to situations where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of
max_pfn and, thus, the valid range of available DRAM.

This can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:

[   76.900000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000
[   76.900000] ea = c0080890, ra = c000462c, cause = 14
[   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops
[   76.900000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---

This patch fixes this by pre-calculating memblock.current_limit
based on the upper limits of the available memory ranges via
adjust_lowmem_bounds, a simplified version of the equivalent
implementation within the arm architecture.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57210 | Incorrect access control in the component ApiPayController.java of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via unsp...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57210</link><description>Incorrect access control in the component ApiPayController.java of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via unspecified vectors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57212 | Incorrect access control in the component ApiOrderService.java of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via a cra...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57212</link><description>Incorrect access control in the component ApiOrderService.java of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via a crafted request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57213 | Incorrect access control in the component orderService.queryObject of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57213</link><description>Incorrect access control in the component orderService.queryObject of platform v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via a crafted request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:48:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54158 | Missing authentication for critical function vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop before 1.4.2-13960 allows local user...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54158</link><description>Missing authentication for critical function vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop before 1.4.2-13960 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54159 | Missing authorization vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop before 1.4.2-13960 allows remote attackers to delete arbitr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54159</link><description>Missing authorization vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop before 1.4.2-13960 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via unspecified vectors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54160 | Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop be...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54160</link><description>Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in BeeDrive in Synology BeeDrive for desktop before 1.4.2-13960 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56427 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in ComposioHQ v.0.7.20 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the _download_file_or_...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56427</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in ComposioHQ v.0.7.20 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the _download_file_or_dir function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63681 | open-webui v0.6.33 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control.

The /configure/plugins/plugin/upload/zip/ and /configure/newupdates/offline/bundle/upload/ endpoints allow low-privilege users to upload ZIP files to the server. The plupload_file_upload function handles these file uploads and constructs the destination file path by using either the name parameter or the uploaded filename, neither of which is properly sanitized. The file extension is extracted by splitting the filename, and a format string is used to construct the final file path, leaving the destination path vulnerable to path traversal. An authenticated attacker with network connectivity can write arbitrary files to the server, enabling remote code execution after overwriting an executable file. An example is the pdflatex executable, which is executed through subprocess.Popen in the write_report_pdf function after requests to a /report/latex/(\d+).pdf endpoint.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65346 | alexusmai laravel-file-manager 3.3.1 and below is vulnerable to Directory Traversal.

When they are powered on, an X11 display server is started. The display server listens on all network interfaces and is accessible over port 6000. The X11 access control list, by default, allows connections from 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.2.15. If a device is powered on and later connected to a network with DHCP, the device may not be assigned the 192.168.2.15 IP address, leaving the display server accessible by other devices on the network. The exposed X11 display server can then be used to gain root privileges and the ability to execute code remotely by interacting with matchbox-desktop and spawning a terminal.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the network configuration functionality, stemming from insufficient input validation when processing network configuration parameters through administrative endpoints. The application allows administrators to modify the server's network configuration through the Django application. This configuration is processed by Bash scripts (TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy) that write user-controlled data directly to environment variables without proper sanitization. After updating environment variables, the scripts execute a source command on /etc/environment; if an attacker injects malicious data into environment variables, this command can enable arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability begins with the /admin/network endpoint, which passes user-supplied form data as arguments to subprocess.Popen calls. The user-supplied input is then used to update environment variables in TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy, and finally source $environment is executed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40217 | pidfs: validate extensible ioctls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40217</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/vaddr: do not repeat pte_offset_map_lock() until success

DAMON's virtual address space operation set implementation (vaddr) calls
pte_offset_map_lock() inside the page table walk callback function.  This
is for reading and writing page table accessed bits.  If
pte_offset_map_lock() fails, it retries by returning the page table walk
callback function with ACTION_AGAIN.

pte_offset_map_lock() can continuously fail if the target is a pmd
migration entry, though.  Hence it could cause an infinite page table walk
if the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished. 
This indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were
running in parallel.

Avoid the infinite loop by simply not retrying the page table walk.  DAMON
is promising only a best-effort accuracy, so missing access to such pages
is no problem.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:59:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40219 | PCI/IOV: Add PCI rescan-remove locking when enabling/disabling SR-IOV</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40219</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Since commit 9d16947b7583 ("PCI: Add global pci_lock_rescan_remove()")
such removal operations are serialized against concurrent remove and
rescan using the pci_rescan_remove_lock. No such locking was ever added
in sriov_disable() however. In particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc
("PCI/IOV: Factor out sriov_add_vfs()") factored out the PCI device
removal into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the
pci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.

On s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double
remove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed:

This is because in addition to sriov_disable() removing the VFs, the
platform also generates hot-unplug events for the VFs. This being the
reverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and
handled via pdev-&gt;no_vf_scan. And while the event processing takes
pci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,
the lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.

Other races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of
locking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. Even on s390 the
list corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform
events are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long
as the removal finished synchronously they would not race. Either way the
locking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.

Just like PCI rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()
including for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is
called without the PCI rescan-remove lock being held. Even in the non-error
case, adding new PCI devices and buses should be serialized via the PCI
rescan-remove lock. Add the necessary locking.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:59:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40220 | fuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40220</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers

I observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.
This test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file
descriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.
Unsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for
responses from the fuseblk server:

# cat /proc/372265/task/372313/stack

[&lt;0&gt;] do_syscall_64+0x37/0xf0
[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

But the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for
responses from itself:

# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack
[&lt;0&gt;] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]

[&lt;0&gt;] do_syscall_64+0x43/0xf0
[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in
the server itself.  So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?
The commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:

"By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty
much guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt
context (during I/O completion).

Aha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.
The completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse
server to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the
struct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the
fuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,
which in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.

Sending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads
is a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous
AIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and
now there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.

Fix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave
a comment explaining why.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:59:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40221 | media: pci: mg4b: fix uninitialized iio scan data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40221</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Initialise scc_index in unix_add_edge().

Quang Le reported that the AF_UNIX GC could garbage-collect a
receive queue of an alive in-flight socket, with a nice repro.

The repro consists of three stages.

  1)
    1-a. Create a single cyclic reference with many sockets
    1-b. close() all sockets
    1-c. Trigger GC

  2)
    2-a. Pass sk-A to an embryo sk-B
    2-b. Pass sk-X to sk-X
    2-c. Trigger GC

  3)
    3-a. accept() the embryo sk-B
    3-b. Pass sk-B to sk-C
    3-c. close() the in-flight sk-A
    3-d. Trigger GC

As of 2-c, sk-A and sk-X are linked to unix_unvisited_vertices,
and unix_walk_scc() groups them into two different SCCs:

  unix_sk(sk-A)-&gt;vertex-&gt;scc_index = 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)
  unix_sk(sk-X)-&gt;vertex-&gt;scc_index = 3

Once GC completes, unix_graph_grouped is set to true.
Also, unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is set to true due to sk-X's
cyclic self-reference, which makes close() trigger GC.

At 3-b, unix_add_edge() allocates unix_sk(sk-B)-&gt;vertex and
links it to unix_unvisited_vertices.

unix_update_graph() is called at 3-a. and 3-b., but neither
unix_graph_grouped nor unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is changed
because both sk-B's listener and sk-C are not in-flight.

3-c decrements sk-A's file refcnt to 1.

Since unix_graph_grouped is true at 3-d, unix_walk_scc_fast()
is finally called and iterates 3 sockets sk-A, sk-B, and sk-X:

  sk-A -&gt; sk-B (-&gt; sk-C)
  sk-X -&gt; sk-X

This is totally fine.  All of them are not yet close()d and
should be grouped into different SCCs.

However, unix_vertex_dead() misjudges that sk-A and sk-B are
in the same SCC and sk-A is dead.

  unix_sk(sk-A)-&gt;scc_index == unix_sk(sk-B)-&gt;scc_index &lt;-- Wrong!
  &amp;&amp;
  sk-A's file refcnt == unix_sk(sk-A)-&gt;vertex-&gt;out_degree
                                       ^-- 1 in-flight count for sk-B
  -&gt; sk-A is dead !?

The problem is that unix_add_edge() does not initialise scc_index.

Stage 1) is used for heap spraying, making a newly allocated
vertex have vertex-&gt;scc_index == 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)
set by unix_walk_scc() at 1-c.

Let's track the max SCC index from the previous unix_walk_scc()
call and assign the max + 1 to a new vertex's scc_index.

This way, we can continue to avoid Tarjan's algorithm while
preventing misjudgments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:12:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40215 | xfrm: delete x-&amp;gt;tunnel as we delete x</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: delete x-&gt;tunnel as we delete x

The ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various
lists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback
is destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still
exists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,
triggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining
references, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 ("xfrm: destroy xfrm_state
synchronously on net exit path") is not complete.

We recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of
skbs (commit 9b6412e6979f ("tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we
currently drop dst")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs
with a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns
destruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the
time xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)
xfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding
fallback state.

Instead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,
this patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the
fallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been
deleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is
dropped.

A separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since
we're going to lock x-&gt;tunnel while x is locked.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:12:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11222 | Central Dogma versions before 0.78.0 contain an Open Redirect vulnerability that allows attackers to redirect users to untrusted sites via s...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11222</link><description>Central Dogma versions before 0.78.0 contain an Open Redirect vulnerability that allows attackers to redirect users to untrusted sites via specially crafted URLs, potentially facilitating phishing attacks and credential theft.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 12:28:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41079 | Multiple vulnerabilities in Seafile</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41079</link><description>A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been found in Seafile v12.0.10.

In 1.33.12, 1.34.10, 1.35.6, 1.36.2, and earlier, Envoy crashes when JWT authentication is configured with the remote JWKS fetching, allow_missing_or_failed is enabled, multiple JWT tokens are present in the request headers and the JWKS fetch fails. This is caused by a re-entry bug in the JwksFetcherImpl. When the first token's JWKS fetch fails, onJwksError() callback triggers processing of the second token, which calls fetch() again on the same fetcher object. The original callback's reset() then clears the second fetch's state (receiver_ and request_) which causes a crash when the async HTTP response arrives.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:20:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64763 | Envoy forwards early CONNECT data in TCP proxy mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64763</link><description>Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In 1.33.12, 1.34.10, 1.35.6, 1.36.2, and earlier, when Envoy is configured in TCP proxy mode to handle CONNECT requests, it accepts client data before issuing a 2xx response and forwards that data to the upstream TCP connection. If a forwarding proxy upstream from Envoy then responds with a non-2xx status, this can cause a de-synchronized CONNECT tunnel state. By default Envoy continues to allow early CONNECT data to avoid disrupting existing deployments. The envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data runtime flag can be set to reject CONNECT requests that send data before a 2xx response when intermediaries upstream from Envoy may reject establishment of a CONNECT tunnel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:20:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64443 | DNS Rebinding vulnerability present when running MCP Gateway in sse or streaming mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64443</link><description>MCP Gateway allows easy and secure running and deployment of MCP servers.

The application follows symbolic links placed inside the ~/Library/Logs/Aquarius directory and treats them as regular files.

A local attacker can exploit this behavior by planting symlinks to arbitrary filesystem locations, resulting in unauthorized disclosure or modification of arbitrary files.

Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo-&gt;font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo-&gt;font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo-&gt;family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo-&gt;font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo-&gt;font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 23:12:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55181 | Sending an HTTP request/response body with greater than 2^31 bytes triggers an infinite loop in proxygen::coro::HTTPQuicCoroSession which bl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55181</link><description>Sending an HTTP request/response body with greater than 2^31 bytes triggers an infinite loop in proxygen::coro::HTTPQuicCoroSession which blocks the backing event loop and unconditionally appends data to a std::vector per-loop iteration.

Prior to version 9.1.1947, an uncontrolled search path vulnerability on Windows allows Vim to execute malicious executables placed in the current working directory for the current edited file. On Windows, when using cmd.exe as a shell, Vim resolves external commands by searching the current working directory before system paths. When Vim invokes tools such as findstr for :grep, external commands or filters via :!, or compiler/:make commands, it may inadvertently run a malicious executable present in the same directory as the file being edited.

The Remote Assist uninstaller performs privileged create, write, execute, and delete actions on predictable files inside a user-writable %TEMP% subdirectory without validating that the directory is trusted or resetting its ACLs when it already exists. A local, low-privileged attacker can pre-create the directory with weak permissions and leverage mount-point or symbolic-link redirection to (a) coerce arbitrary file writes to protected locations, leading to denial of service (e.g., by overwriting sensitive system files), or (b) win a race to redirect DeleteFileW() to attacker-chosen targets, enabling arbitrary file or folder deletion and local privilege escalation to SYSTEM. This issue is fixed in JumpCloud Remote Assist 0.317.0 and affects Windows systems where Remote Assist is installed and managed through the Agent lifecycle.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:57:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65896 | SQL injection vulnerability in long2ice assyncmy thru 0.2.10 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via crafted dict keys.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65896</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in long2ice assyncmy thru 0.2.10 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via crafted dict keys.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:57:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66454 | Arcade MCP Default Hardcoded Worker Secret Allows Full Unauthorized Access to All HTTP MCP Worker Endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66454</link><description>Arcade MCP allows you to to create, deploy, and share MCP Servers.

 a flaw in the seed decryption logic resulted in passwords incorrectly 
being derived solely from the initial vector and the AES-GCM 
authentication tag of the key seed.


This issue has been fixed in gokey version 0.2.0. This is a breaking change. The fix has invalidated any passwords/secrets that were derived from the seed file (using the -s option). Even if the input seed file stays the same, version 0.2.0 gokey will generate different secrets.


Impact
This vulnerability impacts generated keys/secrets using a seed file as an entropy input (using the -s option). Keys/secrets generated just from the master password (without the -s
 option) are not impacted. The confidentiality of the seed itself is 
also not impacted (it is not required to regenerate the seed itself). 
Specific impact includes:



  *  keys/secrets generated from a seed file may have lower entropy: it 
was expected that the whole seed would be used to generate keys (240 
bytes of entropy input), where in vulnerable versions only 28 bytes was 
used

  *  a malicious entity could have recovered all passwords, generated 
from a particular seed, having only the seed file in possession without 
the knowledge of the seed master password




Patches
The code logic bug has been fixed in gokey version 0.2.0
 and above. Due to the deterministic nature of gokey, fixed versions 
will produce different passwords/secrets using seed files, as all seed 
entropy will be used now.


System secret rotation guidance
It is advised for users to regenerate passwords/secrets using the patched version of gokey (0.2.0
 and above), and provision/rotate these secrets into respective systems 
in place of the old secret. A specific rotation procedure is 
system-dependent, but most common patterns are described below.


Systems that do not require the old password/secret for rotation
Such systems usually have a "Forgot password" facility or a
 similar facility allowing users to rotate their password/secrets by 
sending a unique "magic" link to the user's email or phone. In such 
cases users are advised to use this facility and input the newly 
generated password secret, when prompted by the system.


Systems that require the old password/secret for rotation
Such systems usually have a modal password rotation window
 usually in the user settings section requiring the user to input the 
old and the new password sometimes with a confirmation. To 
generate/recover the old password in such cases users are advised to:



  *  temporarily download  gokey version 0.1.3 https://github.com/cloudflare/gokey/releases/tag/v0.1.3  for their respective operating system to recover the old password

  *  use gokey version 0.2.0 or above to generate the new password

  *  populate the system provided password rotation form




Systems that allow multiple credentials for the same account to be provisioned
Such systems usually require a secret or a cryptographic 
key as a credential for access, but allow several credentials at the 
same time. One example is SSH: a particular user may have several 
authorized public keys configured on the SSH server for access. For such
 systems users are advised to:



  *  generate a new secret/key/credential using gokey version 0.2.0 or above

  *  provision the new secret/key/credential in addition to the existing credential on the system

  *  verify that the access or required system operation is still possible with the new secret/key/credential

  *  revoke authorization for the existing/old credential from the system

This may lead to unexpected content in packets sent to the server (for example, part of an MQTT topic may leak into the message body in a PUBLISH packet).


The issue arises because the length of the data passed in was converted from an int64/int32 (depending upon CPU) to an int16 without checks for overflows. The int16 length was then written, followed by the data (e.g. topic). This meant that when the data (e.g. topic) was over 65535 bytes then the amount of data written exceeds what the length field indicates. This could lead to a corrupt packet, or mean that the excess data leaks into another field (e.g. topic leaks into message body).</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 08:48:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13516 | SureMail – SMTP and Email Logs Plugin with Amazon SES, Postmark, and Other Providers &amp;lt;= 1.9.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13516</link><description>The SureMail – SMTP and Email Logs Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in versions up to and including 1.9.0.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary file paths into the orders that are removed, when an administrator deletes them. This can lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability requires the Cost Calculator Builder Pro version to be installed along with the free version in order to be exploitable.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 02:50:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13697 | BlockArt Blocks – Gutenberg Blocks, Page Builder Blocks ,WordPress Block Plugin, Sections &amp;amp; Template Library &amp;lt;= 2.2.13 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `timestamp` Attribute</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13697</link><description>The BlockArt Blocks – Gutenberg Blocks, Page Builder Blocks ,WordPress Block Plugin, Sections &amp; Template Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘timestamp’ attribute in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
