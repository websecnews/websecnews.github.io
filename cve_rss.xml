Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.
After retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 21:48:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56138 | Timestamp signature generation lacks certificate revocation check in notion-go</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56138</link><description>notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 21:48:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56323 | OpenFGA Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56323</link><description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `editar_permissoes.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `msg_c` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs in the `msg_c` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads, which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:58:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22134 | heap-buffer-overflow with visual mode in Vim &amp;lt; 9.1.1003</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22134</link><description>When switching to other buffers using the :all command and visual mode still being active, this may cause a heap-buffer overflow, because Vim does not properly end visual mode and therefore may try to access beyond the end of a line in a buffer. In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:51:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22138 | Private categories allow suggested edits to be viewed via the queue in @codidact/qpixel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22138</link><description>@codidact/qpixel is a Q&amp;amp;A-based community knowledge-sharing software.

In affected versions an admin can add the ability to have users fill out an additional field and users can inject javascript code into it that would be activated once a staffer visits the user's profile on staff panel. As a result an attacker can execute javascript code on the staffer's computer. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.

A user with admincp.core.emails or admincp.users.edit permissions can validate users and an attacker can reset their password. When the account is successfully approved by email the reset code is NULL, but when the account is manually validated by a user with admincp.core.emails or admincp.users.edit permissions then the reset_code will no longer be NULL but empty. An attacker can request http://localhost/nameless/index.php?route=/forgot_password/&amp;amp;c= and reset the password. As a result an attacker may compromise another users password and take over their account. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.1.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.

In affected versions Jte HTML templates with `script` tags or script attributes that include a Javascript template string (backticks) are subject to XSS. The `javaScriptBlock` and `javaScriptAttribute` methods in the `Escape` class do not escape backticks, which are used for Javascript template strings. Dollar signs in template strings should also be escaped as well to prevent undesired interpolation. HTML templates rendered by Jte's `OwaspHtmlTemplateOutput` in versions less than or equal to `3.1.15` with `script` tags or script attributes that contain Javascript template strings (backticks) are vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to version 3.1.16 or later to resolve this issue.

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.


CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:55:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52938 | GPU DDK - rgxfw_pm_add_freelist_for_reconstruction OOB write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52938</link><description>Kernel software installed and running inside a Guest VM may post improper commands to the GPU Firmware to subvert reconstruction activities to trigger a write of data outside the Guest's virtualised GPU memory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:54:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52936 | GPU DDK - rgxfw_hwperf_config OOB read &amp;amp;
