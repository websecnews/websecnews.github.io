When the kylin service runs over HTTP (or other plain text protocol), it is possible for network sniffers to hijack the HTTP payload and get access to the content of kylin.properties and potentially the containing credentials.

To avoid this threat, users are recommended toÂ 

  *  Always turn on HTTPS so that network payload is encrypted.

  *  Avoid putting credentials in kylin.properties, or at least not in plain text.
  *  Use network firewalls to protect the serverside such that it is not accessible to external attackers.

  *  Upgrade to version Apache Kylin 4.0.4, which filters out the sensitive content that goes to the Server Config web interface.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 12:25:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5378 | Stored XSS in SmodBIP and MegaBIP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5378</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in  MegaBIP and already unsupported SmodBIP software allows for Stored XSS.This issue affects SmodBIP in all versions and MegaBIP in versions up to 4.36.2 (newer versions were not tested; the vendor has not confirmed fixing the vulnerability).</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 11:17:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46838 | Linux: netback processing of zero-length transmit fragment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46838</link><description>Transmit requests in Xen's virtual network protocol can consist of
multiple parts.  While not really useful, except for the initial part
any of them may be of zero length, i.e. carry no data at all.  Besides a
certain initial portion of the to be transferred data, these parts are
directly translated into what Linux calls SKB fragments.  Such converted
request parts can, when for a particular SKB they are all of length
zero, lead to a de-reference of NULL in core networking code.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 10:28:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23790 | Missing file type check in avatar picture upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23790</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the upload functionality for user avatars allows functionality misuse due to missing check of filetypes.
