avoid the cookie exiting after the volume has been freed and triggering
the above issue. Therefore call fscache_withdraw_volume() before calling
cachefiles_withdraw_objects().

This way, after setting FSCACHE_CACHE_IS_WITHDRAWN, only the following two
cases will occur:
1) fscache_begin_lookup fails in fscache_begin_volume_access().
2) fscache_withdraw_volume() will ensure that fscache_count_object() has

The fscache_volume in cache-&gt;volumes must not have been freed yet, but its
reference count may be 0. So use the new fscache_try_get_volume() helper
function try to get its reference count.

If the reference count of fscache_volume is 0, fscache_put_volume() is
freeing it, so wait for it to be removed from cache-&gt;volumes.

If its reference count is not 0, call cachefiles_withdraw_volume() with
reference count protection to avoid the above issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41059 | hfsplus: fix uninit-value in copy_name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41059</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[Why]
Potential out of bounds access in dml2_calculate_rq_and_dlg_params()
because the value of out_lowest_state_idx used as an index for FCLKChangeSupport
array can be greater than 1.

[How]
Currently dml2 core specifies identical values for all FCLKChangeSupport

bluetooth/l2cap: sync sock recv cb and release

The problem occurs between the system call to close the sock and hci_rx_work,
where the former releases the sock and the latter accesses it without lock protection.

           CPU0                       CPU1
           ----                       ----

	                              l2cap_sock_recv_cb

If hci_rx_work processes the data that needs to be received before the sock is
closed, then everything is normal; Otherwise, the work thread may access the
released sock when receiving data.

Add a chan mutex in the rx callback of the sock to achieve synchronization between
the sock release and recv cb.

Sock is dead, so set chan data to NULL, avoid others use invalid sock pointer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41063 | Bluetooth: hci_core: cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41063</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]-&gt;skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=, skb=, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41067 | btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41067</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly

[BUG]
When running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the
following ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():

	ASSERT(sector_nr &lt; stripe-&gt;nr_sectors);

Before that, we would have tree dump from
btrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for
the range.

[CAUSE]
Inside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new
bbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some
RST range covering the scrub target.

But if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,
while the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.

Then inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find
the sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is
submitted to lower layers).

And since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any
sector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe-&gt;nr_sectors,
triggering the ASSERT().

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call
btrfs_map_block() first.

Since our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update
stripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().

This new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio
completely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,
where if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the
scrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io
counter).

Although the root cause of RST lookup failure still needs to be
addressed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41068 | s390/sclp: Fix sclp_init() cleanup on failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41068</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()

Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().

It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing
fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be
closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and
then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.

Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in
kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent
the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.

With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which
triggers the race, KASAN detects the UAF:

Fix it by delaying the fdput() until `stt` is no longer in use, which
is effectively the entire function. To keep the patch minimal add a call
to fdput() at each of the existing return paths. Future work can convert
the function to goto or __cleanup style cleanup.

With the fix in place the test case no longer triggers the UAF.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41071 | wifi: mac80211: Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41071</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix quota root leak after quota disable failure

If during the quota disable we fail when cleaning the quota tree or when
deleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the 'out' label without
ever dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of the
root since fs_info-&gt;quota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we have
set it to NULL just before those steps).

Fix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the 'out' label.
This is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 by
commit bed92eae26cc ("Btrfs: qgroup implementation and prototypes"), but
back then we missed a kfree on the quota root and free_extent_buffer()
calls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were not

io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()

The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),
which acquires the sqd-&gt;lock without releasing the uring_lock.
Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee ("io_uring: drop ctx-&gt;uring_lock
before acquiring sqd-&gt;lock"), this can lead to a potential deadlock
situation.

To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling
io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.

This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct
order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41081 | ila: block BH in ila_output()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41081</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fabrics: use reserved tag for reg read/write command

In some scenarios, if too many commands are issued by nvme command in
the same time by user tasks, this may exhaust all tags of admin_q. If
a reset (nvme reset or IO timeout) occurs before these commands finish,
reconnect routine may fail to update nvme regs due to insufficient tags,
which will cause kernel hang forever. In order to workaround this issue,
maybe we can let reg_read32()/reg_read64()/reg_write32() use reserved
tags. This maybe safe for nvmf:

1. For the disable ctrl path,  we will not issue connect command
2. For the enable ctrl / fw activate path, since connect and reg_xx()
   are called serially.

So the reserved tags may still be enough while reg_xx() use reserved tags.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41799 | tgstation-server&amp;#x27;s DreamMaker environment files outside the deployment directory can be compiled and ran by insufficiently permissioned users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41799</link><description>tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.8.0, low permission users using the "Set .dme Path" privilege could potentially set malicious .dme files existing on the host machine to be compiled and executed. These .dme files could be uploaded via tgstation-server (requiring a separate, isolated privilege) or some other means. A server configured to execute in BYOND's trusted security level (requiring a third separate, isolated privilege OR being set by another user) could lead to this escalating into remote code execution via BYOND's shell() proc. The ability to execute this kind of attack is a known side effect of having privileged TGS users, but normally requires multiple privileges with known weaknesses. This vector is not intentional as it does not require control over the where deployment code is sourced from and _may_ not require remote write access to an instance's `Configuration` directory.

if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,
the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.

This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct
reference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:39:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41024 | misc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41024</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not

USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Syzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)
caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint
descriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of
the bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly
other routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for
distinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and
endpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug
identified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers
and directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).

To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress
when we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1
specs say these bits are "Reserved, reset to zero".)  This requires us
to make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and
use the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41036 | net: ks8851: Fix deadlock with the SPI chip variant</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41036</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers

Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available
firmware data buffer.

The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm
block header. This means the overall header length is variable, and the
position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string
fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow
the firmware data buffer.

As this ia bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change to
the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to
introduce new bugs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41039 | firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41039</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header

Fix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for the
wmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.

The original code tested that the firmware data buffer contained
enough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs

	wmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer

But wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 and
Halo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is
4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there
are enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with
wmfw_adsp2_sizes.

This patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each
of the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked
separately before they are used.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41040 | net/sched: Fix UAF when resolving a clash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41040</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcount
of the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb-&gt;destructor, so we check
SOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU grace
period.

Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being put
into the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too early
in udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small race
window:

We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b ("net:
set SOCK_RCU_FREE before inserting socket into hashtable").

Let's apply the same fix for UDP.

netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate

nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will
result in a call stack overflow (ctx-&gt;level &gt;= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).

It also follows maps via -&gt;validate callback in nft_lookup, so there
appears no reason to iterate the maps again.

nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.
This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.

This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in
unbounded recursion:

BUG: TASK stack guard page was hit at ....
Oops: stack guard page: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN

[..]

with a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores.

I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from
nft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in
progress, so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.

For nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend
on table-&gt;validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier
(for improved error reporting to userspace).</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41043 | netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: drop bogus WARN_ON</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41043</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free

Currently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying
to cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as
well, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since
this relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock
situation as the previous patch.

It would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,
as the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once
async_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized
before it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to
arm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is
sufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return
HRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.

However, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer
before entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to
timer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback
running concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is
significantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration
happening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it
the struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.

Hence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after
async_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock
issues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the
global workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at
_different_ points of time, so can share space).

Update existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41046 | net: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix double free in detach</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41046</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix XDP program unloading while removing the driver

The commit 6533e558c650 ("i40e: Fix reset path while removing
the driver") introduced a new PF state "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" to block
modifying the XDP program while the driver is being removed.
Unfortunately, such a change is useful only if the ".ndo_bpf()"
callback was called out of the rmmod context because unloading the
existing XDP program is also a part of driver removing procedure.
In other words, from the rmmod context the driver is expected to
unload the XDP program without reporting any errors. Otherwise,
the kernel warning with callstack is printed out to dmesg.

Example failing scenario:
 1. Load the i40e driver.
 2. Load the XDP program.
 3. Unload the i40e driver (using "rmmod" command).

Fix this by checking if the XDP program is being loaded or unloaded.
Then, block only loading a new program while "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" is set.
Also, move testing "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" flag to the beginning of XDP_SETUP

This crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown
subtest in sockmap_basic.

This crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the
sk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the
architecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch
platform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform
for a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause
is that a zero length skb (skb-&gt;len == 0) was put on the queue.

This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),
invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():

	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);

In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no
page is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty
sge is queued into ingress_msg list.

And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by
sg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it
to kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.

To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),
if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking
copy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by
copy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41049 | filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

 // The expected failed copen was executed successfully

Expect copen to fail, and when it does, it closes fd, which sets the
object to close, and then close triggers reopen again. However, due to
msg_id reuse resulting in a successful copen, the anonymous fd is not
closed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopen
to complete may trigger hung task.

To avoid this issue, allocate the msg_id cyclically to avoid reusing the
msg_id for a very short duration of time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41051 | cachefiles: wait for ondemand_object_worker to finish when dropping object</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41051</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: wait for ondemand_object_worker to finish when dropping object

When queuing ondemand_object_worker() to re-open the object,
cachefiles_object is not pinned. The cachefiles_object may be freed when
the pending read request is completed intentionally and the related
erofs is umounted. If ondemand_object_worker() runs after the object is
freed, it will incur use-after-free problem as shown below.

process A  processs B  process C  process D

cachefiles_ondemand_send_req()
// send a read req X
// wait for its completion

           // close ondemand fd
           cachefiles_ondemand_fd_release()
           // set object as CLOSE

                       cachefiles_ondemand_daemon_read()
                       // set object as REOPENING

                                cachefiles_flush_reqs
                                complete(&amp;amp;req-&gt;done)

// read req X is completed
// umount the erofs fs
cachefiles_put_object()
// object will be freed
cachefiles_ondemand_deinit_obj_info()
kmem_cache_free(object)
                       // both info and object are freed
                       ondemand_object_worker()

When dropping an object, it is no longer necessary to reopen the object,
so use cancel_work_sync() to cancel or wait for ondemand_object_worker()
to finish.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41052 | vfio/pci: Init the count variable in collecting hot-reset devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41052</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In Admidio before version 4.3.9, there is an SQL Injection in the `/adm_program/modules/ecards/ecard_send.php` source file of the Admidio Application. The SQL Injection results in a compromise of the application's database. The value of `ecard_recipients `POST parameter is being directly concatenated with the SQL query in the source code causing the SQL Injection. The SQL Injection can be exploited by a member user, using blind condition-based, time-based, and Out of band interaction SQL Injection payloads.

s390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()

There is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on
s390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in
do_exception().

However, since commit af19487f00f3 ("mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more
general"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with
PTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON
otherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().

Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar
to x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault
flags, for easier debugging.

Note that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot
support swap entries on other levels than PTE level.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 13:43:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41022 | drm/amdgpu: Fix signedness bug in sdma_v4_0_process_trap_irq()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41022</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block

This adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry
to make sure don't stray beyond valid memory region. Before patching, the
loop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the
range. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we
can change dup-&gt;length to dup-&gt;length-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the
next traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may
encounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.

In the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold
an unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and
xfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make
sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a
single-byte name before accessing xfs_dir2_data_entry.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41014 | xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data

There is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members
of xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.

We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by
following these steps:
    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records
    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate
       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and
       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter
       xlog_recover_process_data
    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2
    4) Make the end of the xlog_op_header entries only 1 byte away from
       xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_size
    5) xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_num_logops++
    6) Modify xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_crc

Fix:
Add a check to make sure there is sufficient space to access fixed members
of xlog_op_header.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41015 | ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_check_dir_entry()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41015</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tap: add missing verification for short frame

The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length
in the tap_get_user_xdp() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be
sent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the
tap_get_user_xdp()--&gt;skb_set_network_header() may assume the size is more
than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause out-of-bound
access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer with incorrect
or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.

In the alternative path, tap_get_user() already prohibits short frame which
has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted.

This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like
how tap_get_user() does.
