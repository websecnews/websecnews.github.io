Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 19:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-1192 | Use-after-free in smb2_is_status_io_timeout()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1192</link><description>A use-after-free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS in the Linux Kernel.

Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 15:25:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46245 | Kimai (Authenticated) SSTI to RCE by Uploading a Malicious Twig File</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46245</link><description>Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application.

The Cody AI VSCode extension versions 0.10.0 through 0.14.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution under certain conditions. An attacker in control of a malicious repository could modify the Cody configuration file `.vscode/cody.json` and overwrite Cody commands. If a user with the extension installed opens this malicious repository and runs a Cody command such as /explain or /doc, this could allow arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is rated as critical severity, but with low exploitability. It requires the user to have a malicious repository loaded and execute the overwritten command in VS Code. The issue is exploitable regardless of the user blocking code execution on a repository through VS Code Workspace Trust. The issue was found during a regular 3rd party penetration test. The maintainers of Cody do not have evidence of open source repositories having malicious `.vscode/cody.json` files to exploit this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.1 of the Cody VSCode extension. In case users can't promptly upgrade, they should not open any untrusted repositories with the Cody extension loaded.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 15:25:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46237 | FOG path traversal via unauthenticated endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46237</link><description>FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system.

Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 15:25:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46240 | CodeIgniter4 vulnerable to information disclosure when detailed error report is displayed in production environment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46240</link><description>CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework.

Starting in version 0.6.1 and prior to version 0.7.0, if a KernelSU installed device is infected with a malware whose app signing block specially constructed, it can take over root privileges on the device. The vulnerable verification logic actually obtains the signature of the last block with an id of `0x7109871a`, while the verification logic during Android installation is to obtain the first one. In addition to the actual signature upgrade that has been fixed (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V3), there is also the problem of actual signature downgrading (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V1). Find a condition in the signature verification logic that will cause the signature not to be found error, and KernelSU does not implement the same conditions, so KSU thinks there is a V2 signature, but the APK signature verification actually uses the V1 signature. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.0. As workarounds, keep the KernelSU manager installed and avoid installing unknown apps.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5861 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in microweber/microweber</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5861</link><description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 2.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5862 | Missing Authorization in hamza417/inure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5862</link><description>Missing Authorization in GitHub repository hamza417/inure prior to Build95.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5863 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected in thorsten/phpmyfaq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5863</link><description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.2.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5864 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in thorsten/phpmyfaq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5864</link><description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.2.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5865 | Insufficient Session Expiration in thorsten/phpmyfaq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5865</link><description>Insufficient Session Expiration in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.2.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5866 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without &amp;#x27;Secure&amp;#x27; Attribute in thorsten/phpmyfaq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5866</link><description>Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.2.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5867 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in thorsten/phpmyfaq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5867</link><description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.2.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 02:02:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46138 | JumpServer default admin user email leak password reset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46138</link><description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications.

The cryptographic key handling library, nkeys, recently gained support for encryption, not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function, where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only, not signing.  
FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go, if using the nkeys library, update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 23:52:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45672 | Frigate unsafe deserialization in `load_config_with_no_duplicates` of `frigate/util/builtin.py`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45672</link><description>Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability was identified in the endpoints used to save configurations for Frigate. This can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. This can be performed through the UI at `/config` or through a direct call to `/api/config/save`. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. Input is initially accepted through `http.py`. The user-provided input is then parsed and loaded by `load_config_with_no_duplicates`. However, `load_config_with_no_duplicates` does not sanitize this input by merit of using `yaml.loader.Loader` which can instantiate custom constructors. A provided payload will be executed directly at `frigate/util/builtin.py:110`. This issue may lead to pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46502 | An issue in OpenCRX v.5.2.2 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46502</link><description>An issue in OpenCRX v.5.2.2 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 22:48:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45670 | Frigate cross-site request forgery in `config_save` and `config_set` request handlers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45670</link><description>Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via "drive-by" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration.

Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/&lt;camera_name&gt;` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads.
