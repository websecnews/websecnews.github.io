The admin panel is subject to potential Cross-site scripting (XSS) attach in case an admin assigns a valuator to a proposal, or does any other action that generates an admin activity log where one of the resources has an XSS crafted. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.27.7, 0.28.2, and newer. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may redirect the pages /admin and /admin/logs to other admin pages to prevent this access (i.e. `/admin/organization/edit`).</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 18:45:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39910 | Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the decidim admin panel with QuillJS WYSWYG editor</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39910</link><description>decidim is a Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open government for cities and organizations. The WYSWYG editor QuillJS is subject to potential XSS attach in case the attacker manages to modify the HTML before being uploaded to the server. The attacker is able to change e.g. to &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt; if they know how to craft these requests themselves. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.27.7. All users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should review the user accounts that have access to the admin panel (i.e. general Administrators, and participatory space's Administrators) and remove access to them if they don't need it. Disable the "Enable rich text editor for participants" setting in the admin dashboard</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 18:45:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45799 | Javascript Injection in Vending Info/Buyers Info Module in FluxCP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45799</link><description>FluxCP is a web-based Control Panel for rAthena servers written in PHP. A javascript injection is possible via venders/buyers list pages and shop names, that are currently not sanitized. This allows executing arbitrary javascript code on the user's browser just by visiting the shop pages. As a result all logged in to fluxcp users can have their session info stolen. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 18:45:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45801 | Tampering by prototype polution in DOMPurify</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45801</link><description>DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 18:28:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45854 | A Business Logic vulnerability in Shopkit 1.0 allows an attacker to add products with negative quantities to the shopping cart via the qtd p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45854</link><description>A Business Logic vulnerability in Shopkit 1.0 allows an attacker to add products with negative quantities to the shopping cart via the qtd parameter in the add-to-cart function.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 17:58:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8661 | Stored XSS in the &amp;quot;Next&amp;amp;Previous Nav&amp;quot; block</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8661</link><description>Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 to 9.3.4 and below 8.5.18 are vulnerable to Stored XSS in the "Next&amp;amp;Previous Nav" block. A rogue administrator could add a malicious payload  by executing it in the browsers of targeted users. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector  CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users. Thanks, Chu Quoc Khanh for reporting.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 17:48:26

When developers disable authentication on the Seata-Server and do not use the Seata client SDK dependencies, they may construct uncontrolled serialized malicious requests by directly sending bytecode based on the Seata private protocol.

This issue affects Apache Seata: 2.0.0, from 1.0.0 through 1.8.0.
