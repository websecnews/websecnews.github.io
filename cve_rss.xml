net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during -&gt;change()

Previously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the -&gt;change() operation, only
the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb
list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check
sch-&gt;limit against sch-&gt;q.qlen.

This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures
both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming
excess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)
are updated to use this helper in their -&gt;change() routines.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39498 | WordPress Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium) plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.1 - Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39498</link><description>Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data vulnerability in Spotlight Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium) allows Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data.This issue affects Spotlight - Social Media Feeds (Premium): from n/a through 1.7.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 14:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46804 | Screen 5.0.0 and older versions allow file existence tests when installed setuid-root</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46804</link><description>A minor information leak when running Screen with setuid-root privileges allosw unprivileged users to deduce information about a path that would otherwise not be available.
