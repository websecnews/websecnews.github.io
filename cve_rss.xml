      upto and including version 1.5.12 in Java applications allows
      attacker to execute arbitrary code by compromising an existing
      logback configuration file or by injecting an environment variable
      before program execution.





Malicious logback configuration files can allow the attacker to execute 
arbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator extension.



A successful attack requires the user to have write access to a 
configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious 
environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both 
cases, the attack requires existing privilege.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 15:17:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12786 | X1a0He Adobe Downloader XPC Service com.x1a0he.macOS.Adobe-Downloader.helper shouldAcceptNewConnection privileges management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12786</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in X1a0He Adobe Downloader up to 1.3.1 on macOS.

guests, when the (virtual) VGA is in "standard" mode.  Locking involved
there has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the
return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a
problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of
which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't
relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already
being held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a
deadlock.

This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but
was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light
of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking
discipline work.

In staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered
to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the
locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note
that even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired
for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:29:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45819 | libxl leaks data to PVH guests via ACPI tables</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45819</link><description>PVH guests have their ACPI tables constructed by the toolstack.  The
construction involves building the tables in local memory, which are
then copied into guest memory.  While actually used parts of the local

left with its prior contents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:29:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37962 | WordPress Fusion Page Builder plugin &amp;lt;= 1.6.1 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37962</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Agency Dominion Fusion allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Fusion: from n/a through 1.6.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:28:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12331 | File Manager Pro â Filester &amp;lt;= 1.8.6 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Filebird Plugin Installation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12331</link><description>The File Manager Pro â Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_install_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the NumberOfBytesÂ argument to ExAllocatePoolWithTag, and the Length argument for RtlCopyMemory, both independently dereference their value from the user supplied input buffer inside the EpdlpSetUsbActionÂ function, known as a double-fetch. If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemoryÂ call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. A malicious attacker will need admin privileges to exploit the issue.
This issue affects Endpoint DLP version below R119.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:57:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4617 | Gaining remote control over Govee devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4617</link><description>Incorrect authorization vulnerability in HTTP POST method in Govee Home application on Android and iOS allows remote attacker to control devices owned by other users via changing "device", "sku" and "type" fields' values.Â

In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`).
Thus, a session which's lifetime is already `&gt; time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`, `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 23:57:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-29827 | IBM InfoSphere Information Server clickjacking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29827</link><description>IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 could allow a remote attacker to hijack the clicking action of the victim.

In affected versions a bug in Astroâs CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true`, Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However, a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security. A semicolon-delimited parameter is allowed after the type in `Content-Type`. Web browsers will treat a `Content-Type` such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; abc` as a `simple request` and will not perform preflight validation. In this case, CSRF is not blocked as expected. Additionally, the `Content-Type` header is not required for a request. This issue has been addressed in version 4.16.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 20:51:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56145 | RCE when PHP `register_argc_argv` config setting is enabled in craftcms/cms</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56145</link><description>Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.

In affected versions FileServerService (media proxy) in github.com/misskey-dev/misskey 2024.10.1 or earlier did not detect proxy loops, which allows remote actors to execute a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service via a maliciously crafted note. FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler did not check incoming requests are not coming from another proxy server. An attacker can execute an amplified denial-of-service by sending a nested proxy request to the server and end the request with a malicious redirect back to another nested proxy request.
Leading to unbounded recursion until the original request is timed out. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may configure the reverse proxy to block requests to the proxy with an empty User-Agent header or one containing Misskey/. An attacker can not effectively modify the User-Agent header without making another request to the server.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 19:30:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52579 | Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in various APIs in Misskey</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52579</link><description>Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform.

Issue Summary:
Apache Kafka's implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802 [1].
Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message.
However, Kafka's SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation.

Impact:
This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly
discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3].
Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue.

How to Detect If You Are Impacted:
If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted.
To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted.

Fix Details:
The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802.

Affected Versions:
Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below.

Fixed Versions:
3.9.0
3.8.1
3.7.2

Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue.

Recommendations for Mitigation:
Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by:
- Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication:
Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception.
- Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms:
Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:41:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34990 | A relative path traversal in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.0 through 8.6.5 and 8.5.0 through 8.5.4 allows attacker to execute unauthorized c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34990</link><description>A relative path traversal in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.0 through 8.6.5 and 8.5.0 through 8.5.4 allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specially crafted web requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48889 | An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiManager version...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48889</link><description>An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiManager version 7.6.0, version 7.4.4 and below, version 7.2.7 and below, version 7.0.12 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiManager Cloud version 7.4.4 and below, version 7.2.7 to 7.2.1, version 7.0.12 to 7.0.1 may allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute unauthorized code via FGFM crafted requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50570 | A Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability [CWE-312] in FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 through 7.4.1, 7.2.0 through 7.2.6, 7.0.0 t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50570</link><description>A Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability [CWE-312] in FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 through 7.4.1, 7.2.0 through 7.2.6, 7.0.0 through 7.0.13 and FortiClientLinux 7.4.0 through 7.4.2, 7.2.0 through 7.2.7, 7.0.0 through 7.0.13 may permit a local authenticated user to retrieve VPN password via memory dump, due to JavaScript's garbage collector</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49677 | WordPress Bootstrap Buttons plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49677</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in David Cramer Bootstrap Buttons allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Bootstrap Buttons: from n/a through 1.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51646 | WordPress Saoshyant Element plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2 -  Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51646</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saoshyant Saoshyant Element allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Saoshyant Element: from n/a through 1.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52485 | WordPress WP Menu Image plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52485</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Yudiz Solutions Ltd.

RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 04:47:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11254 | AMP for WP â Accelerated Mobile Pages &amp;lt;= 1.1.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11254</link><description>The AMP for WP â Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the disqus_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input validation.

The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name "cluster-manager" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named "cluster-manager", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 23:14:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51175 | An issue in H3C switch h3c-S1526 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the S1526.cfg component.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51175</link><description>An issue in H3C switch h3c-S1526 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the S1526.cfg component.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:53:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52792 | Arbitrary config values override in lam</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52792</link><description>LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a php webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In affected versions LAM does not properly sanitize configuration values, that are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`. This allows setting arbitrary config values and thus effectively bypassing `mitigation` of CVE-2024-23333/GHSA-fm9w-7m7v-wxqv. Configuration values for the main config or server profiles are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`.
The values are written to `config.cfg` or `serverprofile.conf` in the format of `settingsName: settingsValue` line-by-line.
An attacker can smuggle arbitrary config values in a config file, by inserting a newline into certain config fields, followed by the value. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:53:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29646 | Buffer Overflow vulnerability in radarorg radare2 v.5.8.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the name, type, or group fields.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29646</link><description>Buffer Overflow vulnerability in radarorg radare2 v.5.8.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the name, type, or group fields.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31668 | rizin before v0.6.3 is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements via meta_set function in librz/analysis/meta.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31668</link><description>rizin before v0.6.3 is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements via meta_set function in librz/analysis/meta.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56142 | Path Traversal in pghoard</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56142</link><description>pghoard is a PostgreSQL backup daemon and restore tooling that stores backup data in cloud object stores.
