This could allow an attacker to read potentially sensitive data or possibly cause a denial-of-service by writing malformed data to certain gRPC endpoints. This flaw has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3, and customers should consider upgrading to 1.3.3 as soon as possible.
The flaw is due to a misconfiguration in the Istio Gateway, which manages authentication and authorization for the affected endpoints. The security policy relies on an explicit definition of required permissions in the Istio Gateway configuration, and the affected endpoints were not defined in the configuration.

Specifi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66438</link><description>A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in the Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0 Print Format rendering mechanism. Specifically, the API frappe.www.printview.get_html_and_style() triggers the rendering of the html field inside a Print Format document using frappe.render_template(template, doc) via the get_rendered_template() call chain. Although ERPNext wraps Jinja2 in a SandboxedEnvironment, it exposes sensitive functions such as frappe.db.sql through get_safe_globals(). An authenticated attacker with permission to create or modify a Print Format can inject arbitrary Jinja expressions into the html field. Once the malicious Print Format is saved, the attacker can call get_html_and_style() with a target document (e.g., Supplier or Sales Invoice) to trigger the render process. This leads to information disclosure from the database, such as database version, schema details, or sensitive values, depending on the injected payload. Exploitation flow: Create a Print Format with SSTI payload in the html field; call the get_html_and_style() API; triggers frappe.render_template(template, doc) inside get_rendered_template(); leaks database information via frappe.db.sql or other exposed globals.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66436 | An SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability exists in the get_terms_and_conditions method of Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0.

This function renders address templates using frappe.render_template() with a context derived from the address_dict parameter, which can be either a dictionary or a string referencing an Address document. Although ERPNext uses a custom Jinja2 SandboxedEnvironment, dangerous functions like frappe.db.sql remain accessible via get_safe_globals(). An authenticated attacker with permission to create or modify an Address Template can inject arbitrary Jinja expressions into the template field. By creating an Address document with a matching country, and then calling the get_address_display API with address_dict="address_name", the system will render the malicious template using attacker-controlled data. This leads to server-side code execution or database information disclosure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:42:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66439 | An issue was discovered in Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0.

This is due to improper sanitization of the `filterText` parameter in the `ajaxUpdatePaginationLinks` AJAX action. The sanitization logic can be bypassed by using the sequence `*$/` which becomes `*/` after the `$` character is removed, allowing attackers to escape SQL comment contexts. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database via a time-based blind SQL injection technique.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:58:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14581 | HAPPY – Helpdesk Support Ticket System &amp;lt;= 1.0.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Ticket Reply</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14581</link><description>The HAPPY – Helpdesk Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the 'submit_form_reply' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9.

due to the absence of proper CSRF validation. This issue allows an 
unauthenticated attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into 
visiting a maliciously crafted link, potentially enabling unauthorized 
modification of PLC settings or the upload of malicious programs which 
could lead to significant disruption or damage to connected systems.</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 02:07:29 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
