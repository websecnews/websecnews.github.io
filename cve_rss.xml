It allows people to temporarily switch to another user account. The module provides a "Masquerade as admin" permission to restrict people (who can masquerade) from switching to an account with administrative privileges. This permission is not always honored and may allow non-administrative users to masquerade as an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the "Masquerade as user" permission.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 22:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27823 | An issue was discovered in the Mail Disguise module before 1.x-1.0.5 for Backdrop CMS.

A path traversal issue exists at /v1/internal/upload-to-local-directory which is enabled when the Local env variable is set to true, such as when Cognita is setup using Docker. Because the docker environment sets up the backend uvicorn server with auto reload enabled, when an attacker overwrites the /app/backend/__init__.py file, the file will automatically be reloaded and executed. This allows an attacker to get remote code execution in the context of the Docker container.

While the MIDI jacks are configured correctly, and the MIDIStreaming
endpoint descriptors are filled with the correct information,
bNumEmbMIDIJack and bLength are set incorrectly in these descriptors.

This does not matter when the numbers of in and out ports are equal, but
when they differ the host will receive broken descriptors with
uninitialized stack memory leaking into the descriptor for whichever
value is smaller.

The precise meaning of "in" and "out" in the port counts is not clearly
defined and can be confusing.  But elsewhere the driver consistently
uses this to match the USB meaning of IN and OUT viewed from the host,
so that "in" ports send data to the host and "out" ports receive data
from it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 09:29:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21836 | io_uring/kbuf: reallocate buf lists on upgrade</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21836</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/uring_cmd: unconditionally copy SQEs at prep time

This isn't generally necessary, but conditions have been observed where
SQE data is accessed from the original SQE after prep has been done and
outside of the initial issue. Opcode prep handlers must ensure that any
SQE related data is stable beyond the prep phase, but uring_cmd is a bit
special in how it handles the SQE which makes it susceptible to reading
stale data. If the application has reused the SQE before the original
completes, then that can lead to data corruption.

Down the line we can relax this again once uring_cmd has been sanitized
a bit, and avoid unnecessarily copying the SQE.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 09:29:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21838 | usb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after device removal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21838</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop

Move the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value
out of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware
with a stale vcpu-&gt;arch.dr6.

When the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,
KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on
VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs
at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint
only generates one VM-Exit.

For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also
identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)
and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading
DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.

But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for
KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas
VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the
guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done
_inside_ the core run loop.

Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common
x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in
hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is
a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu-&gt;arch.dr6 and
clobber the guest's actual value.

The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX
preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6
being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is
orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the
VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection
and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the
window where hardware DR6 is "dirty" extends all the way from L1 writing
DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

thermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI header

The intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY
attribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a
segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 ("thermal: netlink: Add the
commands and the events for the thresholds").

The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value
was changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.

Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and
use the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit
itself is questionable.

The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr,
which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks
and unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event
users.

Solve the issue by moving the newly introduced
THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the
enum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic
netlink attributes remain unaffected.

Macro support is disabled by default in Collabora Online, but can be enabled by an administrator. Collabora Online typically hosts each document instance within a jail and is allowed to download content from locations controlled by the net.lok_allow configuration option, which by default include the private IP ranges to enable access to the local network. If enabled, macros were allowed run executable binaries. By combining an ability to host executables, typically in the local network, in an allowed accessible location, with a macro enabled Collabora Online, it was then possible to install arbitrary binaries within the jail and execute them. These executables are restricted to the same jail file system and user as the document instance but can be used to bypass the additional limits on what network hosts are accessible and provide more flexibility as a platform for further attempts. This is issue is fixed in 24.04.12.4, 23.05.19, 22.05.25 and later macros.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 18:49:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25191 | Group-Office has a Stored XSS Vulnerability via user&amp;#x27;s name field</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25191</link><description>Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool.

commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let's use that
directly.

Lack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable
value, NULL, and dereferencing it.

Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control

tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()

syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),
for one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fix
this warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,
for practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the
"too small to fail" memory-allocation rule applies.

One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such
request will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately
returning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.
There is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:41:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58086 | drm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58086</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Avoid putting some root ports into D3 on TUXEDO Sirius Gen1

commit 9d26d3a8f1b0 ("PCI: Put PCIe ports into D3 during suspend") sets the
policy that all PCIe ports are allowed to use D3.  When the system is
suspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be
used for wakeup via a PME this sets up the policy for these ports to go
into D3hot.

This policy generally makes sense from an OSPM perspective but it leads to
problems with wakeup from suspend on the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a
specific old BIOS. This manifests as a system hang.

On the affected Device + BIOS combination, add a quirk for the root port of
the problematic controller to ensure that these root ports are not put into
D3hot at suspend.

This patch is based on

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230708214457.1229-2-mario.limonciello@amd.com

but with the added condition both in the documentation and in the code to
apply only to the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a specific old BIOS and only
the affected root ports.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:41:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21832 | block: don&amp;#x27;t revert iter for -EIOCBQUEUED</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21832</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached
process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a "kernel implementation detail" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be
supported in i386.

We used the wrong device for the device managed functions. We used the

If we unbind the driver from the usb interface, the cleanup functions
are never called. In our case, the IRQ is never disabled.

If an IRQ is triggered, it will try to access memory sections that are
already free, causing an OOPS.

We cannot use the function devm_request_threaded_irq here. The devm_*
clean functions may be called after the main structure is released by
uvc_delete.

with gpio units and the user has to unbind the device, a disconnect will

KVM: Explicitly verify target vCPU is online in kvm_get_vcpu()

Explicitly verify the target vCPU is fully online _prior_ to clamping the
index in kvm_get_vcpu().  If the index is "bad", the nospec clamping will
generate '0', i.e. KVM will return vCPU0 instead of NULL.

In practice, the bug is unlikely to cause problems, as it will only come
into play if userspace or the guest is buggy or misbehaving, e.g. KVM may
send interrupts to vCPU0 instead of dropping them on the floor.

However, returning vCPU0 when it shouldn't exist per online_vcpus is
problematic now that KVM uses an xarray for the vCPUs array, as KVM needs
to insert into the xarray before publishing the vCPU to userspace (see
commit c5b077549136 ("KVM: Convert the kvm-&gt;vcpus array to a xarray")),
i.e. before vCPU creation is guaranteed to succeed.

As a result, incorrectly providing access to vCPU0 will trigger a
use-after-free if vCPU0 is dereferenced and kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()
bails out of vCPU creation due to an error and frees vCPU0.  Commit
afb2acb2e3a3 ("KVM: Fix vcpu_array[0] races") papered over that issue, but
in doing so introduced an unsolvable teardown conundrum.  Preventing
accesses to vCPU0 before it's fully online will allow reverting commit
afb2acb2e3a3, without re-introducing the vcpu_array[0] UAF race.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21829 | RDMA/rxe: Fix the warning &amp;quot;__rxe_cleanup+0x12c/0x170 [rdma_rxe]&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

the bucket lock is unlocked. However, it will make the concurrent
overwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when
the map is full.

Therefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling
of bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:
1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value
2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to
   cancel it again
Considering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try
to acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is
running, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has
downside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is
delayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable
(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in
locked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if
necessary.

It is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the
problem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the
softirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced
in v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra
depends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.

netfilter: nf_tables: reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key length

The field length description provides the length of each separated key
field in the concatenation, each field gets rounded up to 32-bits to
calculate the pipapo rule width from pipapo_init(). The set key length
provides the total size of the key aligned to 32-bits.

Register-based arithmetics still allows for combining mismatching set
key length and field length description, eg. set key length 10 and field
description [ 5, 4 ] leading to pipapo width of 12.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21827 | Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for usb_driver_claim_interface()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21827</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for usb_driver_claim_interface()

The documentation for usb_driver_claim_interface() says that "the
device lock" is needed when the function is called from places other
than probe(). This appears to be the lock for the USB interface
device. The Mediatek btusb code gets called via this path:

  Workqueue: hci0 hci_power_on [bluetooth]
  Call trace:
   usb_driver_claim_interface
   btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf
   btusb_mtk_setup
   hci_dev_open_sync
   hci_power_on
   process_scheduled_works
   worker_thread
   kthread

With the above call trace the device lock hasn't been claimed. Claim
it.

Without this fix, we'd sometimes see the error "Failed to claim iso
interface". Sometimes we'd even see worse errors, like a NULL pointer
dereference (where `intf-&gt;dev.driver` was NULL) with a trace like:

  Call trace:
   usb_suspend_both
   usb_runtime_suspend
   __rpm_callback
   rpm_suspend
   pm_runtime_work
   process_scheduled_works

Both errors appear to be fixed with the proper locking.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21828 | wifi: mac80211: don&amp;#x27;t flush non-uploaded STAs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21828</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: convert workqueues to unbound

When a workqueue is created with `WQ_UNBOUND`, its work items are
served by special worker-pools, whose host workers are not bound to
any specific CPU. In the default configuration (i.e. when
`queue_delayed_work` and friends do not specify which CPU to run the
work item on), `WQ_UNBOUND` allows the work item to be executed on any
CPU in the same node of the CPU it was enqueued on. While this
solution potentially sacrifices locality, it avoids contention with
other processes that might dominate the CPU time of the processor the
work item was scheduled on.

This is not just a theoretical problem: in a particular scenario
misconfigured process was hogging most of the time from CPU0, leaving
less than 0.5% of its CPU time to the kworker. The IDPF workqueues
that were using the kworker on CPU0 suffered large completion delays
as a result, causing performance degradation, timeouts and eventual
system crash.


* I have also run a manual test to gauge the performance
  improvement. The test consists of an antagonist process
  (`./stress --cpu 2`) consuming as much of CPU 0 as possible. This
  process is run under `taskset 01` to bind it to CPU0, and its
  priority is changed with `chrt -pQ 9900 10000 ${pid}` and
  `renice -n -20 ${pid}` after start.

  Then, the IDPF driver is forced to prefer CPU0 by editing all calls
  to `queue_delayed_work`, `mod_delayed_work`, etc... to use CPU 0.

  Finally, `ktraces` for the workqueue events are collected.

  Without the current patch, the antagonist process can force
  arbitrary delays between `workqueue_queue_work` and
  `workqueue_execute_start`, that in my tests were as high as
  `30ms`. With the current patch applied, the workqueue can be
  migrated to another unloaded CPU in the same node, and, keeping
  everything else equal, the maximum delay I could see was `6us`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58058 | ubifs: skip dumping tnc tree when zroot is null</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58058</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject struct_ops registration that uses module ptr and the module btf_id is missing

There is a UAF report in the bpf_struct_ops when CONFIG_MODULES=n.
In particular, the report is on tcp_congestion_ops that has
a "struct module *owner" member.

For struct_ops that has a "struct module *owner" member,
it can be extended either by the regular kernel module or
by the bpf_struct_ops. bpf_try_module_get() will be used
to do the refcounting and different refcount is done
based on the owner pointer. When CONFIG_MODULES=n,
the btf_id of the "struct module" is missing:

WARN: resolve_btfids: unresolved symbol module

Thus, the bpf_try_module_get() cannot do the correct refcounting.

Not all subsystem's struct_ops requires the "struct module *owner" member.
e.g. the recent sched_ext_ops.

This patch is to disable bpf_struct_ops registration if
the struct_ops has the "struct module *" member and the
"struct module" btf_id is missing. The btf_type_is_fwd() helper
is moved to the btf.h header file for this test.

This has happened since the beginning of bpf_struct_ops which has gone
through many changes. The Fixes tag is set to a recent commit that this
patch can apply cleanly. Considering CONFIG_MODULES=n is not
common and the age of the issue, targeting for bpf-next also.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58061 | wifi: mac80211: prohibit deactivating all links</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58061</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: pcf85063: fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read

The nvmem interface supports variable buffer sizes, while the regmap
interface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses a
buffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of bounds
as it expects the buffer to point at an unsigned int.

Fix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58070 | bpf: bpf_local_storage: Always use bpf_mem_alloc in PREEMPT_RT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58070</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

There is no need to adjust the gfp_flags passing to the
bpf_mem_cache_alloc_flags() which only honors the GFP_KERNEL.
The verifier has ensured GFP_KERNEL is passed only in sleepable context.

It has been an old issue since the first introduction of the
bpf_local_storage ~5 years ago, so this patch targets the bpf-next.

bpf_mem_alloc is needed to solve it, so the Fixes tag is set
to the commit when bpf_mem_alloc was first used in the bpf_local_storage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58071 | team: prevent adding a device which is already a team device lower</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58071</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

team: prevent adding a device which is already a team device lower

Prevent adding a device which is already a team device lower,
e.g. adding veth0 if vlan1 was already added and veth0 is a lower of
vlan1.

This is not useful in practice and can lead to recursive locking:

$ ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
$ ip link set veth0 up
$ ip link set veth1 up
$ ip link add link veth0 name veth0.1 type vlan protocol 802.1Q id 1
$ ip link add team0 type team
$ ip link set veth0.1 down
$ ip link set veth0.1 master team0
team0: Port device veth0.1 added
$ ip link set veth0 down
$ ip link set veth0 master team0

wifi: rtlwifi: remove unused check_buddy_priv

Commit 2461c7d60f9f ("rtlwifi: Update header file") introduced a global
list of private data structures.

Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 ("rtlwifi Modify existing bits to match
vendor version 2013.02.07") started adding the private data to that list at
probe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from
a similar device.

However, that function was never used.

Besides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And when
the probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. This
would cause a second probe to access freed memory.

Remove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent the
potential race condition on the list and its corruption during a second
probe when probe fails.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:20:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58073 | drm/msm/dpu: check dpu_plane_atomic_print_state() for valid sspp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58073</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:51:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25632 | Tenda AC15 v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to Command Injection via the handler function in /goform/telnet.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25632</link><description>Tenda AC15 v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to Command Injection via the handler function in /goform/telnet.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:34:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25634 | A vulnerability has been found in Tenda AC15 15.03.05.19 in the function GetParentControlInfo of the file /goform/GetParentControlInfo.
