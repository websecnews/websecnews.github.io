This is due to improper error handling in the RSA decryption process combined with a lack of path sanitization when writing uploaded files. When the plugin fails to decrypt a session key using openssl_private_decrypt(), it does not terminate execution and instead passes the boolean false value to the phpseclib library's AES cipher initialization. The library treats this false value as a string of null bytes, allowing an attacker to encrypt a malicious payload using a predictable null-byte key. Additionally, the plugin accepts filenames from the decrypted payload without sanitization, enabling directory traversal to escape the protected backup directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to publicly accessible directories and achieve Remote Code Execution via the wpvivid_action=send_to_site parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 06:17:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1893 | Orbisius Random Name Generator &amp;lt;= 1.0.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via &amp;#x27;btn_label&amp;#x27; Shortcode Attribute</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1893</link><description>The Orbisius Random Name Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'btn_label' parameter in the 'orbisius_random_name_generator' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

The application accepts user-supplied URLs and performs server-side HTTP or HTTPS requests without sufficient validation or destination restrictions. The implementation does not enforce allowlists, block internal or private IP address ranges, or apply request timeouts or response size limits. An attacker can abuse this behavior to induce the server to issue outbound requests to arbitrary hosts, including internal network resources, potentially enabling internal network scanning and denial of service through resource exhaustion.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:53:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26013 | LangChain affected by SSRF via image_url token counting in ChatOpenAI.get_num_tokens_from_messages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26013</link><description>LangChain is a framework for building agents and LLM-powered applications. Prior to 1.2.11, the ChatOpenAI.get_num_tokens_from_messages() method fetches arbitrary image_url values without validation when computing token counts for vision-enabled models. This allows attackers to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by providing malicious image URLs in user input. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.11.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:53:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26007 | cryptography Subgroup Attack Due to Missing Subgroup Validation for SECT Curves</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26007</link><description>cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Prior to 46.0.5, the public_key_from_numbers (or EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()), EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key(), load_der_public_key() and load_pem_public_key() functions do not verify that the point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup of the curve. This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point P from a small-order subgroup. This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as S = [victim_private_key]P via ECDH, this leaks information about victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order). For curves with cofactor &gt; 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key. When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup. Only SECT curves are impacted by this. This vulnerability is fixed in 46.0.5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:01:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26006 | Redos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) at Code Extraction Block in significant-gravitas/autogpt</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26006</link><description>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The autogpt before 0.6.32 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service due to the use of regex at Code Extraction Block. The two Regex are used containing the corresponding dangerous patterns \s+[\s\S]*? and \s+(.*?). They share a common characteristic — the combination of two adjacent quantifiers that can match the same space character (\s). As a result, an attacker can supply a long sequence of space characters to trigger excessive regex backtracking, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.32.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:01:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12699 | ZOLL ePCR IOS Mobile Application Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12699</link><description>The ZOLL ePCR IOS application reflects unsanitized user input into a WebView. Attacker-controlled strings placed into PCR fields (run number, incident, call sign, notes) are interpreted as HTML/JS when the app prints or renders that content.

From 0.5 to 0.5.17, local attacker can exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in munged (the MUNGE authentication daemon) to leak cryptographic key material from process memory. With the leaked key material, the attacker could forge arbitrary MUNGE credentials to impersonate any user (including root) to services that rely on MUNGE for authentication. The vulnerability allows a buffer overflow by sending a crafted message with an oversized address length field, corrupting munged's internal state and enabling extraction of the MAC subkey used for credential verification. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.5.18.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:49:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25609 | profile command may permit unauthorized configuration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25609</link><description>Incorrect validation of the profile command may result in the determination that a request altering the 'filter' is read-only.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:49:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25613 | An unsafe cast in the MongoDB query planner can result in a segmentation fault.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25613</link><description>An authorized user may disable the MongoDB server by issuing a query against a collection that contains an invalid compound wildcard index.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:49:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26009 | Catalyst Affected by Remote Code Execution as Root via Containerized Install Script Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26009</link><description>Catalyst is a platform built for enterprise game server hosts, game communities, and billing panel integrations.

The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54192 | An issue inTcpreplay v4.5.1 allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file to the tcpedit_dlt_getplugin function at...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54192</link><description>An issue inTcpreplay v4.5.1 allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file to the tcpedit_dlt_getplugin function at src/tcpedit/plugins/dlt_utils.c.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52436 | An Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability [CWE-79] vulnerability in Fortinet For...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-52436</link><description>An Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability [CWE-79] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiSandbox 5.0.0 through 5.0.1, FortiSandbox 4.4.0 through 4.4.7, FortiSandbox 4.2 all versions, FortiSandbox 4.0 all versions may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands via crafted requests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55018 | An inconsistent interpretation of http requests ('http request smuggling') vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55018</link><description>An inconsistent interpretation of http requests ('http request smuggling') vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7.4.9, FortiOS 7.2 all versions, FortiOS 7.0 all versions, FortiOS 6.4.3 through 6.4.16 may allow  an unauthenticated attacker to smuggle an unlogged http request through the firewall policies via a specially crafted header</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62439 | An Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel vulnerability [CWE-940] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.4,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62439</link><description>An Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel vulnerability [CWE-940] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.4, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7.4.9, FortiOS 7.2 all versions, FortiOS 7.0 all versions may allow an authenticated user with knowledge of FSSO policy configurations to gain unauthorized access to protected network resources via crafted requests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62676 | An Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') vulnerability [CWE-59] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62676</link><description>An Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') vulnerability [CWE-59] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 through 7.4.4, FortiClientWindows 7.2.0 through 7.2.12, FortiClientWindows 7.0 all versions may allow a local low-privilege attacker to perform an arbitrary file write with elevated permissions via crafted named pipe messages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64157 | A use of externally-controlled format string vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.4, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7.4.9, FortiOS 7.2...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64157</link><description>A use of externally-controlled format string vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.4, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7.4.9, FortiOS 7.2.0 through 7.2.11, FortiOS 7.0 all versions allows an authenticated admin to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted configuration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:49:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68686 | An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability [CWE-200] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.1,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68686</link><description>An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability [CWE-200] vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.6.0 through 7.6.1, FortiOS 7.4.0 through 7.4.6, FortiOS 7.2 all versions, FortiOS 7.0 all versions, FortiOS 6.4 all versions may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the patch developed for the symbolic link persistency mechanism observed in some post-exploit cases, via crafted HTTP requests.

This issue affects Apache Shiro: from 1.*, 2.* before 2.0.7.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later, which fixes the issue.

Prior to Shiro 2.0.7, code paths for non-existent vs. existing users are different enough,
that a brute-force attack may be able to tell, by timing the requests only, determine if
the request failed because of a non-existent user vs. wrong password.

The most likely attack vector is a local attack only.
Shiro security model  https://shiro.apache.org/security-model.html#username_enumeration  discusses this as well.

Typically, brute force attack can be mitigated at the infrastructure level.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23906 | Apache Druid: Authentication Bypass via LDAP Anonymous Bind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23906</link><description>Affected Products and Versions
  *  Apache Druid
  *  Affected Versions: 0.17.0 through 35.x (all versions prior to 36.0.0)
  *  Prerequisites:  *  druid-basic-security extension enabled
  *  LDAP authenticator configured
  *  Underlying LDAP server permits anonymous bind                                                                                                                                                   






Vulnerability Description

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Apache Druid when using the druid-basic-security extension with LDAP authentication. If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous
binds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.

The vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. 

Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can:
  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster
  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources
  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data
  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges

Prior to v4.5.4, DocumentSettings._determineIsTrusted treats the configuration value cSpell.trustedWorkspace as the authoritative trust flag. The value defaults to true (package.json) and is read from workspace configuration each time settings are fetched. The code coerces any truthy value to true and forwards it to ConfigLoader.setIsTrusted , which in turn allows JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files ( .cspell.config.js/.mjs/.ts , etc.) to be located and executed. Because no VS Code workspace-trust state is consulted, an untrusted workspace can keep the flag true and place a malicious .cspell.config.js ; opening the workspace causes the extension host to execute attacker-controlled Node.js code with the user’s privileges.

From 6.0.0 to 8.3.0, the Super-linter GitHub Action is vulnerable to command injection via crafted filenames. When this action is used in downstream GitHub Actions workflows, an attacker can submit a pull request that introduces a file whose name contains shell command substitution syntax, such as $(...). In affected Super-linter versions, runtime scripts may execute the embedded command during file discovery processing, enabling arbitrary command execution in the workflow runner context. This can be used to disclose the job’s GITHUB_TOKEN depending on how the workflow configures permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.3.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:01:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25765 | Faraday affected by SSRF via protocol-relative URL host override in build_exclusive_url</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25765</link><description>Faraday is an HTTP client library abstraction layer that provides a common interface over many adapters. Prior to 2.14.1, Faraday's build_exclusive_url method (in lib/faraday/connection.rb) uses Ruby's URI#merge to combine the connection's base URL with a user-supplied path. Per RFC 3986, protocol-relative URLs (e.g. //evil.com/path) are treated as network-path references that override the base URL's host/authority component. This means that if any application passes user-controlled input to Faraday's get(), post(), build_url(), or other request methods, an attacker can supply a protocol-relative URL like //attacker.com/endpoint to redirect the request to an arbitrary host, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.14.1.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:01:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25791 | Sliver has a DNS C2 OTP Bypass Allows Unauthenticated Session Flooding and Denial of Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25791</link><description>Sliver is a command and control framework that uses a custom Wireguard netstack. Prior to 1.7.0, the DNS C2 listener accepts unauthenticated TOTP bootstrap messages and allocates server-side DNS sessions without validating OTP values, even when EnforceOTP is enabled. Because sessions are stored without a cleanup/expiry path in this flow, an unauthenticated remote actor can repeatedly create sessions and drive memory exhaustion.

The LangSmith SDK's distributed tracing feature is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery via malicious HTTP headers. An attacker can inject arbitrary api_url values through the baggage header, causing the SDK to exfiltrate sensitive trace data to attacker-controlled endpoints. When using distributed tracing, the SDK parses incoming HTTP headers via RunTree.from_headers() in Python or RunTree.fromHeaders() in Typescript. The baggage header can contain replica configurations including api_url and api_key fields. Prior to the fix, these attacker-controlled values were accepted without validation. When a traced operation completes, the SDK's post() and patch() methods send run data to all configured replica URLs, including any injected by an attacker. This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.6.3 of the Python SDK and  0.4.6 of the JavaScript SDK.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:01:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25639 | Axios affected by Denial of Service via __proto__ Key in mergeConfig</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25639</link><description>Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

Before 2.52.11, on Go versions prior to 1.24, the underlying crypto/rand implementation can return an error if secure randomness cannot be obtained. Because no error is returned by the Fiber v2 UUID functions, application code may unknowingly rely on predictable, repeated, or low-entropy identifiers in security-critical pathways. This is especially impactful because many Fiber v2 middleware components (session middleware, CSRF, rate limiting, request-ID generation, etc.) default to using utils.UUIDv4().

This issue affects Apache Shiro: before 2.0.7.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7, which fixes the issue.

The issue only effects static files. If static files are served from a case-insensitive filesystem,
such as default macOS setup, static files may be accessed by varying the case of the filename in the request.
If only lower-case (common default) filters are present in Shiro, they may be bypassed this way.

Shiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate this issue
shiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true
application.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true

Shiro 3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2226 | DouPHP ZIP File file.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2226</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in DouPHP up to 1.9.
