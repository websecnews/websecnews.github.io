The integration of Google Gimini 1.0 Pro with `HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE` for `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH` and `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT` in `safety_settings` disables content protection. This allows malicious commands to be executed, such as reading sensitive file contents like `/etc/passwd`.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:41:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7446 | itsourcecode Ticket Reservation System list_tickets.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7446</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in itsourcecode Ticket Reservation System 1.0.

This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 20:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7319 | Openstack-heat: incomplete fix for cve-2023-1625</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7319</link><description>An incomplete fix for CVE-2023-1625 was found in openstack-heat.
