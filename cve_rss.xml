The exploit can be triggered when any user accesses the public API endpoint of the malicious SVG images, or if the malicious images are embedded in an `iframe` element, during a widget creation, deployed to any page of the platform (e.g., dashboards), and accessed during normal operations. The vulnerability resides in the `ImageController`, which fails to restrict the execution of JavaScript code when an image is loaded by the user's browser. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:15:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12421 | Account Takeover via Code Exchange Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12421</link><description>Mattermost versions 11.0.x &lt;= 11.0.2, 10.12.x &lt;= 10.12.1, 10.11.x &lt;= 10.11.4, 10.5.x &lt;= 10.5.12 fail to to verify that the token used during the code exchange originates from the same authentication flow, which allows an authenticated user to perform account takeover via a specially crafted email address used when switching authentication methods and sending a request to the /users/login/sso/code-exchange endpoint.

For example, when {name} is used in an email template, it will be replaced with the buyer's name for the final email. If the name of the attendee contained HTML or Markdown formatting, this was rendered as HTML in the resulting email. This way, a user could inject links or other formatted text through a maliciously formatted name. Since pretix applies a strict allow list approach to allowed HTML tags, this could not be abused for XSS or similarly dangerous attack chains. However, it can be used to manipulate emails in a way that makes user-provided content appear in a trustworthy and credible way, which can be abused for phishing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:10:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10476 | WP Fastest Cache &amp;lt;= 1.4.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) DB Cleanup Actions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10476</link><description>The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_db_fix_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0.

Prior to version 2.52.0, developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the User-Agent header starting with the string "Mozilla" as a defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the User-Agent header to be modified. Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement (malvertising).

Prior to versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1, there is a XSRF token leakage via protocol-relative URLs in angular HTTP clients. The vulnerability is a Credential Leak by App Logic that leads to the unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token to an attacker-controlled domain. Angular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol (http:// or https://) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (//), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the X-XSRF-TOKEN header. This issue has been patched in versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1. A workaround for this issue involves avoiding using protocol-relative URLs (URLs starting with //) in HttpClient requests. All backend communication URLs should be hardcoded as relative paths (starting with a single /) or fully qualified, trusted absolute URLs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:21:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65202 | TRENDnet TEW-657BRM 1.00.1 has an authenticated remote OS command injection vulnerability in the setup.cgi binary, exploitable via the HTTP ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65202</link><description>TRENDnet TEW-657BRM 1.00.1 has an authenticated remote OS command injection vulnerability in the setup.cgi binary, exploitable via the HTTP parameters "command", "todo", and "next_file," which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12571 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12571</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 17.10 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that could have allowed an unauthenticated user to cause a Denial of Service condition by sending specifically crafted requests containing malicious JSON payloads.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12653 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12653</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 18.3 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that under specific conditions could have allowed an unauthenticated user to join arbitrary organizations by changing headers on some requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13611 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13611</link><description>GitLab has remediated an issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 13.2 before 18.4.5, 18.5 before 18.5.3, and 18.6 before 18.6.1 that could have allowed an authenticated user with access to certain logs to obtain sensitive tokens under specific conditions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50433 | An issue was discovered in imonnit.com (2025-04-24) allowing malicious actors to gain escalated privileges via crafted password reset to tak...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50433</link><description>An issue was discovered in imonnit.com (2025-04-24) allowing malicious actors to gain escalated privileges via crafted password reset to take over arbitrary user accounts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65670 | An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in classroomio 0.1.13 allows students to access sensitive admin/teacher endpoints by manipulating...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65670</link><description>An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in classroomio 0.1.13 allows students to access sensitive admin/teacher endpoints by manipulating course IDs in URLs, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive course, admin, and student data.

In this case, the secret is generated using `ThreadLocalRandom`,
 which is not a crypto-graphically secure random number generator. This 
may allow an attacker to predict or brute force the secret used to sign 
authentication cookies, potentially enabling token forgery or 
authentication bypass. Additionally, each process generates its own 
fallback secret, resulting in inconsistent secrets across nodes. This 
causes authentication failures in distributed or multi-broker 
deployments, effectively leading to a incorrectly configured clusters. Users are 
advised to configure a strong `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret`



This issue affects Apache Druid: through 34.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 35.0.0, which fixes the issue making it mandatory to set `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` when using the Kerberos authenticator.

The vulnerability is only exploitable by trusted/authorized users/applications that are allowed to call directly the Thrift APIs. In most real-world deployments, HMS is accessible to only a handful of applications (e.g., Hiveserver2) thus the vulnerability is not exploitable. Moreover, the vulnerable code cannot be reached when metastore.try.direct.sql property is set to false.

This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.1.0 before 4.2.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.2.0, which fixes the issue. Users who cannot upgrade directly are encouraged to set metastore.try.direct.sql property to false if the HMS Thrift APIs are exposed to general public.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 08:59:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13735 | Out-of-bounds Read in nr flc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13735</link><description>Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in ASR1903、ASR3901 in ASR Lapwing_Linux on Linux (nr_fw modules).

The `status_sql.php` endpoint constructs SQL UPDATE queries by directly concatenating user-controlled `sw1` and `sw2` parameters without using parameterized queries or `pg_escape_string()`. While PostgreSQL's `pg_exec` limitations prevent stacked queries, attackers can inject subqueries for data exfiltration and leverage verbose error messages for reconnaissance.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:08:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66261 | Unauthenticated OS Command Injection (restore_settings.php)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66261</link><description>Unauthenticated OS Command Injection (restore_settings.php) in DB Electronica Telecomunicazioni S.p.A.

The `restore_mozzi_memories.sh` script extracts user-controlled tar archives with `-C /` flag, depositing contents to the filesystem root without path validation. When combined with the unauthenticated file upload vulnerabilities (CVE-01, CVE-06, CVE-07), attackers can craft malicious .tgz archives containing path-traversed filenames (e.g., `etc/shadow`, `var/www/index.php`) to overwrite critical system files in writable directories, achieving full system compromise.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:08:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66263 | Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via Null Byte Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66263</link><description>Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via Null Byte Injection in DB Electronica Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. Mozart FM Transmitter versions 30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 3500, 6000, 7000 allows an attacker to perform Null byte injection in download_setting.php allows reading arbitrary files.
The `/var/tdf/download_setting.php` endpoint constructs file paths by concatenating user-controlled `$_GET['filename']` with a forced `.tgz` extension. Running on PHP 5.3.2 (pre-5.3.4), the application is vulnerable to null byte injection (%00), allowing attackers to bypass the extension restriction and traverse paths. By requesting `filename=../../../../etc/passwd%00`, the underlying C functions treat the null byte as a string terminator, ignoring the appended `.tgz` and enabling unauthenticated arbitrary file disclosure of any file readable by the web server user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:08:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66264 | Unquoted Service path in UPSilon2000V6.0 SYSTEM privilege service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66264</link><description>The CMService.exe service runs with SYSTEM privileges and contains an unquoted service path.
