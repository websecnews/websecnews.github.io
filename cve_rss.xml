ALSA: pcm: oss: Limit the period size to 16MB

Set the practical limit to the period size (the fragment shift in OSS)
instead of a full 31bit; a too large value could lead to the exhaust
of memory as we allocate temporary buffers of the period size, too.

As of this patch, we set to 16MB limit, which should cover all use
cases.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47510 | btrfs: fix re-dirty process of tree-log nodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47510</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  [3310.968214] BTRFS: error (device sda) in cleanup_transaction:1946: errno=-11 unknown

The abort occurs because of a write hole while writing out freeing tree
nodes of a tree-log tree. For zoned btrfs, we re-dirty a freed tree
node to ensure btrfs can write the region and does not leave a hole on
write on a zoned device. The current code fails to re-dirty a node
when the tree-log tree's depth is greater or equal to 2. That leads to
a transaction abort with -EAGAIN.

Fix the issue by properly re-dirtying a node on walking up the tree.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47511 | ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix negative period/buffer sizes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47511</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix negative period/buffer sizes

The period size calculation in OSS layer may receive a negative value
as an error, but the code there assumes only the positive values and
handle them with size_t.  Due to that, a too big value may be passed
to the lower layers.

This patch changes the code to handle with ssize_t and adds the proper
error checks appropriately.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47512 | net/sched: fq_pie: prevent dismantle issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47512</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fq_pie: prevent dismantle issue

For some reason, fq_pie_destroy() did not copy
working code from pie_destroy() and other qdiscs,
thus causing elusive bug.

Before calling del_timer_sync(&amp;amp;q-&gt;adapt_timer),
we need to ensure timer will not rearm itself.

seg6: fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block

When an IPv4 packet is received, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving
interface index into the IPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4,
net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):

    IPCB(skb)-&gt;iif = skb-&gt;skb_iif;

If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH
header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation.
In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control
block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):

    memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));

The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 ("ipv6: sr: clear
IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation") a long time ago (2019-01-29).

Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share
the same memory area (skb-&gt;cb), the receiving interface index info is lost
(IP6CB(skb)-&gt;iif is set to zero).

As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if
commit 0857d6f8c759 ("ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig
netdev") is applied.

To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)-&gt;iif with the index of the
receiving interface once again.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47516 | nfp: Fix memory leak in nfp_cpp_area_cache_add()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47516</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: do not perform operations on net devices being unregistered

There is a short period between a net device starts to be unregistered
and when it is actually gone. In that time frame ethtool operations
could still be performed, which might end up in unwanted or undefined
behaviours[1].

Do not allow ethtool operations after a net device starts its
unregistration. This patch targets the netlink part as the ioctl one
isn't affected: the reference to the net device is taken and the
operation is executed within an rtnl lock section and the net device
won't be found after unregister.

[1] For example adding Tx queues after unregister ends up in NULL
    pointer exceptions and UaFs, such as:

serial: core: fix transmit-buffer reset and memleak

Commit 761ed4a94582 ("tty: serial_core: convert uart_close to use
tty_port_close") converted serial core to use tty_port_close() but
failed to notice that the transmit buffer still needs to be freed on
final close.

Not freeing the transmit buffer means that the buffer is no longer
cleared on next open so that any ioctl() waiting for the buffer to drain
might wait indefinitely (e.g. on termios changes) or that stale data can
end up being transmitted in case tx is restarted.

Furthermore, the buffer of any port that has been opened would leak on
driver unbind.

Note that the port lock is held when clearing the buffer pointer due to
the ldisc race worked around by commit a5ba1d95e46e ("uart: fix race
between uart_put_char() and uart_shutdown()").

Also note that the tty-port shutdown() callback is not called for
console ports so it is not strictly necessary to free the buffer page
after releasing the lock (cf. d72402145ace ("tty/serial: do not free
trasnmit buffer page under port lock")).</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47528 | usb: cdnsp: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cdnsp_endpoint_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47528</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix this bug by adding a check of pep-&gt;ring.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.

Builds with CONFIG_USB_CDNSP_GADGET=y show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47529 | iwlwifi: Fix memory leaks in error handling path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47529</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP

In commit 510410bfc034 ("drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object
function") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's
good, but we missed a little bit.

Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through the
drm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj-&gt;funcs-&gt;mmap()` was NULL. That meant
that we ran:

  vma-&gt;vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
  vma-&gt;vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma-&gt;vm_flags));
  vma-&gt;vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma-&gt;vm_page_prot);

...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that
`obj-&gt;funcs-&gt;mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default
code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP
was important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that
use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this
(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a
5.15 kernel):

Let's add the two flags back in.

While we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means
that we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save
an instruction.

NOTE: it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the
problem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane
thing to do so I'm doing that too.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47532 | drm/msm/devfreq: Fix OPP refcnt leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47532</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

However, the refcounting was off and we thus ended up leaking the
drm_crtc_commit structure every commit. Add a drm_crtc_commit_put to
prevent the leakage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47535 | drm/msm/a6xx: Allocate enough space for GMU registers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47535</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: Allocate enough space for GMU registers

In commit 142639a52a01 ("drm/msm/a6xx: fix crashstate capture for
A650") we changed a6xx_get_gmu_registers() to read 3 sets of
registers. Unfortunately, we didn't change the memory allocation for
the array. That leads to a KASAN warning (this was on the chromeos-5.4
kernel, which has the problematic commit backported to it):

smc_lgr_cleanup_early() meant to delete the link

This may cause memory corruption since we didn't
remove the real link group from the list and later
memseted the link group structure.

tcp: fix page frag corruption on page fault

Steffen reported a TCP stream corruption for HTTP requests
served by the apache web-server using a cifs mount-point
and memory mapping the relevant file.

The root cause is quite similar to the one addressed by
commit 20eb4f29b602 ("net: fix sk_page_frag() recursion from
memory reclaim"). Here the nested access to the task page frag
is caused by a page fault on the (mmapped) user-space memory
buffer coming from the cifs file.

The page fault handler performs an smb transaction on a different
socket, inside the same process context. Since sk-&gt;sk_allaction
for such socket does not prevent the usage for the task_frag,
the nested allocation modify "under the hood" the page frag
in use by the outer sendmsg call, corrupting the stream.

The overall relevant stack trace looks like the following:

lacking the __GFP_FS flag. Do not define an additional mm-helper
for that, as this is strictly tied to the sk page frag usage.

 - use a stricted sk_page_frag() check instead of reordering the

ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress

The kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables
firewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing
rules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, every
incoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.

After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked
down the issue to ca7a03c41753 ("ipv6: do not free rt if
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule").

The problem with that change is that the generic `args-&gt;flags` always have
`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag
`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not
decreasing the refcount when needed.

How to reproduce:
 - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:
     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
   This can be done with:
     sudo nft create table inet test
     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'
     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
 - Run:
     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0
 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase
   with every incoming ipv6 packet.

This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol
specific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`
argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.

blk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()

For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't call
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying to
cancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().

However, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The log
shows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),
which is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi disk
is closed and the scsi_device is removed.

Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()
and disk_release():

1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any sync
dispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough to
quiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.

2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, and
passthrough request is always explicitly allocated &amp; freed by
its caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity
for passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just cancel
dispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.

sched/scs: Reset task stack state in bringup_cpu()

To hot unplug a CPU, the idle task on that CPU calls a few layers of C
code before finally leaving the kernel. When KASAN is in use, poisoned
shadow is left around for each of the active stack frames, and when
shadow call stacks are in use. When shadow call stacks (SCS) are in use
the task's saved SCS SP is left pointing at an arbitrary point within
the task's shadow call stack.

When a CPU is offlined than onlined back into the kernel, this stale
state can adversely affect execution. Stale KASAN shadow can alias new
stackframes and result in bogus KASAN warnings. A stale SCS SP is
effectively a memory leak, and prevents a portion of the shadow call
stack being used. Across a number of hotplug cycles the idle task's
entire shadow call stack can become unusable.

We previously fixed the KASAN issue in commit:

  e1b77c92981a5222 ("sched/kasan: remove stale KASAN poison after hotplug")

... by removing any stale KASAN stack poison immediately prior to
onlining a CPU.

Subsequently in commit:

  f1a0a376ca0c4ef1 ("sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled")

... the refactoring left the KASAN and SCS cleanup in one-time idle
thread initialization code rather than something invoked prior to each
CPU being onlined, breaking both as above.

We fixed SCS (but not KASAN) in commit:

  63acd42c0d4942f7 ("sched/scs: Reset the shadow stack when idle_task_exit")

... but as this runs in the context of the idle task being offlined it's
potentially fragile.

To fix these consistently and more robustly, reset the SCS SP and KASAN
shadow of a CPU's idle task immediately before we online that CPU in
bringup_cpu(). This ensures the idle task always has a consistent state
when it is running, and removes the need to so so when exiting an idle
task.

Whenever any thread is created, dup_task_struct() will give the task a
stack which is free of KASAN shadow, and initialize the task's SCS SP,
so there's no need to specially initialize either for idle thread within
init_idle(), as this was only necessary to handle hotplug cycles.

I've tested this on arm64 with:

* gcc 11.1.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK
* clang 12.0.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK, SHADOW_CALL_STACK

... offlining and onlining CPUS with:

| while true; do
|   for C in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online; do
|     echo 0 &gt; $C;
|     echo 1 &gt; $C;

ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and
.set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is
buggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver
provides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer
dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.

Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
- have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
 .set_coalesce(), or
- have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't
  cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()

net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface

The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to
stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a
kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions:
* reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L)
* reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G)
* installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)

Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping
an interface.

Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing
any of the actions above:

mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware

When processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,
the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local
ports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a
netdev.

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling
netif_carrier_{on,off}().

Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU
port. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47561 | i2c: virtio: disable timeout handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47561</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: virtio: disable timeout handling

If a timeout is hit, it can result is incorrect data on the I2C bus
and/or memory corruptions in the guest since the device can still be
operating on the buffers it was given while the guest has freed them.

Here is, for example, the start of a slub_debug splat which was
triggered on the next transfer after one transfer was forced to timeout
by setting a breakpoint in the backend (rust-vmm/vhost-device):

There is no simple fix for this (the driver would have to always create
bounce buffers and hold on to them until the device eventually returns
the buffers), so just disable the timeout support for now.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47562 | ice: fix vsi-&amp;gt;txq_map sizing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47562</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix vsi-&gt;txq_map sizing

The approach of having XDP queue per CPU regardless of user's setting
exposed a hidden bug that could occur in case when Rx queue count differ
from Tx queue count. Currently vsi-&gt;txq_map's size is equal to the
doubled vsi-&gt;alloc_txq, which is not correct due to the fact that XDP
rings were previously based on the Rx queue count. Below splat can be
seen when ethtool -L is used and XDP rings are configured:

ice: avoid bpf_prog refcount underflow

Ice driver has the routines for managing XDP resources that are shared
between ndo_bpf op and VSI rebuild flow. The latter takes place for
example when user changes queue count on an interface via ethtool's
set_channels().

There is an issue around the bpf_prog refcounting when VSI is being
rebuilt - since ice_prepare_xdp_rings() is called with vsi-&gt;xdp_prog as
an argument that is used later on by ice_vsi_assign_bpf_prog(), same
bpf_prog pointers are swapped with each other. Then it is also
interpreted as an 'old_prog' which in turn causes us to call
bpf_prog_put on it that will decrement its refcount.

Below splat can be interpreted in a way that due to zero refcount of a
bpf_prog it is wiped out from the system while kernel still tries to
refer to it:

Some x86-64 CPUs have a CPU feature called "Supervisor Mode Access
Prevention (SMAP)", which is used to detect wrong access from the kernel
to user buffers like this: SMAP triggers a permissions violation on
wrong access.  In the x86-64 variant of clear_user(), SMAP is properly
handled via clac()+stac().

To fix, properly use clear_user() when we're dealing with a user buffer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47567 | powerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47567</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Since the commit c118c7303ad5 ("powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack - Do not

results in a hard lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still
addressed with its virtual address allthough data MMU is not active

net: nexthop: fix null pointer dereference when IPv6 is not enabled

When we try to add an IPv6 nexthop and IPv6 is not enabled
(!CONFIG_IPV6) we'll hit a NULL pointer dereference[1] in the error path
of nh_create_ipv6() due to calling ipv6_stub-&gt;fib6_nh_release. The bug
has been present since the beginning of IPv6 nexthop gateway support.
Commit 1aefd3de7bc6 ("ipv6: Add fib6_nh_init and release to stubs") tells
us that only fib6_nh_init has a dummy stub because fib6_nh_release should
not be called if fib6_nh_init returns an error, but the commit below added
a call to ipv6_stub-&gt;fib6_nh_release in its error path. To fix it return
the dummy stub's -EAFNOSUPPORT error directly without calling
ipv6_stub-&gt;fib6_nh_release in nh_create_ipv6()'s error path.

iio: mma8452: Fix trigger reference couting

The mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct iio_dev. The
IIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop
the reference count by 1.

Without the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count
can reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a
use-after-free occurs.

Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the
IIO device.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47501 | i40e: Fix NULL pointer dereference in i40e_dbg_dump_desc</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47501</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This patch ensures that the channel is actually free before adding to
the dai channel list and also ensures that the channel is on the list

io_uring: ensure task_work gets run as part of cancelations

If we successfully cancel a work item but that work item needs to be
processed through task_work, then we can be sleeping uninterruptibly
in io_uring_cancel_generic() and never process it. Hence we don't
make forward progress and we end up with an uninterruptible sleep
warning.

While in there, correct a comment that should be IFF, not IIF.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47505 | aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47505</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling

signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a
waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.

Unfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of
non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't
handle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or
binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.

Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.

A patch by Ramji Jiyani 
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)
tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request
inline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.
First, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio
context while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal
locking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications
are missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.

The second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then
properly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a
deadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that
freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47506 | nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47506</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race

A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
removed from del_recall_lru.

Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
usually in the laundromat thread.

I suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
writes" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0
and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure
where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47507 | nfsd: Fix nsfd startup race (again)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47507</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Fix nsfd startup race (again)

Commit bd5ae9288d64 ("nfsd: register pernet ops last, unregister first")
has re-opened rpc_pipefs_event() race against nfsd_net_id registration
(register_pernet_subsys()) which has been fixed by commit bb7ffbf29e76
("nfsd: fix nsfd startup race triggering BUG_ON").

Restore the order of register_pernet_subsys() vs register_cld_notifier().
Add WARN_ON() to prevent a future regression.

In case brtfs_qgroup_reserve_data() or btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata()
fail the allocated extent_changeset will not be freed.

So in btrfs_check_data_free_space() and btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space()
free the allocated extent_changeset to get rid of the allocated memory.

The issue currently only happens in the direct IO write path, but only
after 65b3c08606e5 ("btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure when attempting direct IO
write into NOCOW range"), and also at defrag_one_locked_target(). Every
other place is always calling extent_changeset_free() even if its call
to btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space() or btrfs_check_data_free_space() has
failed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 15:19:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33470 | An issue in the SMTP Email Settings of AVTECH Room Alert 4E v4.4.0 allows attackers to gain access to credentials in plaintext via a passbac...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33470</link><description>An issue in the SMTP Email Settings of AVTECH Room Alert 4E v4.4.0 allows attackers to gain access to credentials in plaintext via a passback attack.

OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1803 | EmbedPress – Embed PDF, Google Docs, Vimeo, Wistia, Embed YouTube Videos, Audios, Maps &amp;amp; Embed Any Documents in Gutenberg &amp;amp; Elementor &amp;lt;= 3.9.12 - Insufficient Authorization Checks to Block Usual</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1803</link><description>The EmbedPress – Embed PDF, Google Docs, Vimeo, Wistia, Embed YouTube Videos, Audios, Maps &amp; Embed Any Documents in Gutenberg &amp; Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to insufficient authorization validation on the PDF embed block in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.12.

On Windows, fetching refs that clash with legacy device names reads from the devices, and checking out paths that clash with such names writes arbitrary data to the devices. This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances. If Windows is not used, or untrusted repositories are not cloned or otherwise used, then there is no impact. A minor degradation in availability may also be possible, such as with a very large file named `CON`, though the user could interrupt the application.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 12:44:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34060 | Arbitrary File Write in IRIS EVTX Pipeline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34060</link><description>IrisEVTXModule is an interface module for Evtx2Splunk and Iris in order to ingest Microsoft EVTX log files.

Several inputs were not persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, but only in local browser storage to save settings of "environments" of the UI and e.g. the last performed "search queries", resulting in a "Reflected XSS" vulnerability.




However, several other inputs were persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, leading to a "Stored XSS" vulnerability. Those mean that authenticated and authorized users at Eclipse Ditto can persist Things in Ditto which can - when being displayed by other users also being authorized to see those Things in the Eclipse Ditto UI - cause scripts to be executed in the browser of other users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 10:18:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2861 | ProfilePress &amp;lt;= 4.15.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via ProfilePress User Panel Widget</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2861</link><description>The ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ProfilePress User Panel widget in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap_connect()

Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.
