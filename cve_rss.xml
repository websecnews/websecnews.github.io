The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.

The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.

On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.

One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.

Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an [`InvalidInput`][4] error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.

The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22423 | yt-dlp `--exec` command injection when using `%q` in yt-dlp on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22423</link><description>yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However, this escaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade, avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `"`, `|` or `&amp;`; and/or instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27242 | Zoom Desktop Client for Linux - Cross Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27242</link><description>Cross site scripting in Zoom Desktop Client for Linux before version 5.17.10 may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31454 | PsiTransfer file integrity violation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31454</link><description>PsiTransfer is an open source, self-hosted file sharing solution. Prior to version 2.2.0, the absence of restrictions on the endpoint, which is designed for uploading files, allows an attacker who received the id of a file distribution to change the files that are in this distribution. The vulnerability allows an attacker to influence those users who come to the file distribution after them and slip the victim files with a malicious or phishing signature. Version 2.2.0 contains a patch for this issue.

CVE-2024-31454 allows users to violate the integrity of a file that is uploaded by another user. In this case, additional files are not loaded into the file bucket. Violation of integrity at the level of individual files. While the vulnerability with the number CVE-2024-31453 allows users to violate the integrity of a file bucket without violating the integrity of files uploaded by other users. Thus, vulnerabilities are reproduced differently, require different security recommendations and affect different objects of the application’s business logic.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31506 | Sourcecodester Online Graduate Tracer System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the "id" parameter in admin/admin_cs.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31506</link><description>Sourcecodester Online Graduate Tracer System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the "id" parameter in admin/admin_cs.php.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31507 | Sourcecodester Online Graduate Tracer System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the "request" parameter in admin/fetch_gendercs.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31507</link><description>Sourcecodester Online Graduate Tracer System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the "request" parameter in admin/fetch_gendercs.php.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24694 | Zoom Desktop Client for Windows - Improper Privilege Management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24694</link><description>Improper privilege management in the installer for Zoom Desktop Client for Windows before version 5.17.10 may allow an authenticated user to conduct an escalation of privilege via local access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:24:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27247 | Zoom Desktop Client for macOS - Improper Privilege Management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27247</link><description>Improper privilege management in the installer for Zoom Desktop Client for macOS before version 5.17.10 may allow a privileged user to conduct an escalation of privilege via local access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:24:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31453 | PsiTransfer vulnerable to violation of the integrity of file distribution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31453</link><description>PsiTransfer is an open source, self-hosted file sharing solution.

generation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29905</link><description>DIRAC is an interware, meaning a software framework for distributed computing. Prior to version 8.0.41, during the proxy generation process (e.g., when using `dirac-proxy-init`), it is possible for unauthorized users on the same machine to gain read access to the proxy. This allows the user to then perform any action that is possible with the original proxy. This vulnerability only exists for a short period of time (sub-millsecond) during the generation process. Version 8.0.41 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, setting the `X509_USER_PROXY` environment variable to a path that is inside a directory that is only readable to the current user avoids the potential risk. After the file has been written, it can be safely copied to the standard location (`/tmp/x509up_uNNNN`).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:58:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31455 | Minder GetRepositoryByName data leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31455</link><description>Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:58:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30262 | Contao&amp;#x27;s remember-me tokens will not be cleared after a password change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30262</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system.

memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 13:57:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2011-10006 | GamerZ WP-PostRatings wp-postratings.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-10006</link><description>A vulnerability was found in GamerZ WP-PostRatings up to 1.64.
