This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter 'product_tmp_two' for computing a security hash against price tampering while using 'wspsc_product' to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item.</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:17:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0618 | A malicious third party could invoke a persistent denial of service vulnerability in FireEye EDR agent by sending a specially-crafted tamper...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0618</link><description>A malicious third party could invoke a persistent denial of service vulnerability in FireEye EDR agent by sending a specially-crafted tamper protection event to the HX service to trigger an exception.

Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:44:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29743 | D-Link DIR-816 A2V1.1.0B05 was found to contain a command injection in /goform/delRouting.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29743</link><description>D-Link DIR-816 A2V1.1.0B05 was found to contain a command injection in /goform/delRouting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:27:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26159 | Laravel Starter 11.11.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the tags feature.

Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:50:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32956 | ManageWiki has SQL injection vulnerability in NamespaceMigrationJob</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32956</link><description>ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis.
