These management operations should be restricted to users with the tenant admin role or superuser role. An authenticated user with produce permission can create subscriptions and update subscription properties on partitioned topics, even though this should be limited to users with consume permissions. This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. 

3.0 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.
3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.2.2.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 19:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30531 | WordPress Nelio Content plugin &amp;lt;= 3.2.0 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30531</link><description>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Nelio Software Nelio Content.This issue affects Nelio Content: from n/a through 3.2.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 18:47:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24888 | WordPress Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 3.2.25 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24888</link><description>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Kadence WP Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks.This issue affects Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks: from n/a through 3.2.25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 18:26:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30532 | WordPress Builderall Builder for WordPress plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0.1 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30532</link><description>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Builderall Team Builderall Builder for WordPress.This issue affects Builderall Builder for WordPress: from n/a through 2.0.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 18:26:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30335 | Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm Annotation Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30335</link><description>Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm Annotation Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability.

libceph: just wait for more data to be available on the socket

A short read may occur while reading the message footer from the
socket.  Later, when the socket is ready for another read, the
messenger invokes all read_partial_*() handlers, including
read_partial_sparse_msg_data().  The expectation is that
read_partial_sparse_msg_data() would bail, allowing the messenger to
invoke read_partial() for the footer and pick up where it left off.

However read_partial_sparse_msg_data() violates that and ends up
calling into the state machine in the OSD client.  The sparse-read
state machine assumes that it's a new op and interprets some piece of
the footer as the sparse-read header and returns bogus extents/data
length, etc.

To determine whether read_partial_sparse_msg_data() should bail, let's
reuse cursor-&gt;total_resid.  Because once it reaches to zero that means
all the extents and data have been successfully received in last read,
else it could break out when partially reading any of the extents and
data.  And then osd_sparse_read() could continue where it left off.

x86/lib: Revert to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user() fixups

During memory error injection test on kernels &gt;= v6.4, the kernel panics
like below. However, this issue couldn't be reproduced on kernels &lt;= v6.3.

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 296: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1: bd80000000100134
  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:&lt;ffffffff821b9776&gt; {__get_user_nocheck_4+0x6/0x20}

  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check

The MCA code can recover from an in-kernel #MC if the fixup type is
EX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel is attempting to
access userspace memory. However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULT
the only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.

ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses
(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.

Therefore, commit

  b19b74bc99b1 ("x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() and put_user()")

replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()
fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.

Commit

  6014bc27561f ("x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM")

added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() in
ex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses due
to LAM.

With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()
exception fixups in order to be able to handle in-kernel MCEs correctly
again.

af_unix: Call kfree_skb() for dead unix_(sk)-&gt;oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a warning [0] in __unix_gc() with a repro, which
creates a socketpair and sends one socket's fd to itself using the
peer.

  socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, [3, 4]) = 0
  sendmsg(4, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base="\360", iov_len=1}],
          msg_iovlen=1, msg_control=[{cmsg_len=20, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
                                      cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, cmsg_data=[3]}],
          msg_controllen=24, msg_flags=0}, MSG_OOB|MSG_PROBE|MSG_DONTWAIT|MSG_ZEROCOPY) = 1

This forms a self-cyclic reference that GC should finally untangle
but does not due to lack of MSG_OOB handling, resulting in memory
leak.

Recently, commit 11498715f266 ("af_unix: Remove io_uring code for
GC.") removed io_uring's dead code in GC and revealed the problem.

The code was executed at the final stage of GC and unconditionally
moved all GC candidates from gc_candidates to gc_inflight_list.
That papered over the reported problem by always making the following
WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&amp;gc_candidates)) false.

The problem has been there since commit 2aab4b969002 ("af_unix: fix
struct pid leaks in OOB support") added full scm support for MSG_OOB
while fixing another bug.

To fix this problem, we must call kfree_skb() for unix_sk(sk)-&gt;oob_skb
if the socket still exists in gc_candidates after purging collected skb.

Then, we need to set NULL to oob_skb before calling kfree_skb() because
it calls last fput() and triggers unix_release_sock(), where we call
duplicate kfree_skb(u-&gt;oob_skb) if not NULL.

Note that the leaked socket remained being linked to a global list, so
kmemleak also could not detect it.  We need to check /proc/net/protocol
to notice the unfreed socket.

x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section

The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of
the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from
32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)

This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the
loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,
to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
appearing in the middle of the image.

Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI
loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference
implementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the
basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be
described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner
without leaving any gaps.

So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight
padding overhead (&lt; 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling
CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days)</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 07:16:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26679 | inet: read sk-&amp;gt;sk_family once in inet_recv_error()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26679</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal

As mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly found
that some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response,
so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happening
we never connect to such an AP.

Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring
the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element
being stuck in the probe response.

Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a
channel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In
this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's
actually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect
in the middle of that.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 07:16:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26683 | wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp

We recently added some validation that we don't try to
connect to an AP that is currently in a channel switch
process, since that might want the channel to be quiet
or we might not be able to connect in time to hear the
switching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b
("wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's in
a CSA process").

However, we promptly got a report that this caused new
connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that
we now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an
extended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.
The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware
3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.

As a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealing
with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 07:16:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26684 | net: stmmac: xgmac: fix handling of DPP safety error for DMA channels</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26684</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: time-travel: fix time corruption

In 'basic' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), we
still get timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrary
points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes
time forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get
the interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,
but before actually finishing that, the interrupt will set
the time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,
and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do the
forwarding.

Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating the
adjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts
disabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:53:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52634 | drm/amd/display: Fix disable_otg_wa logic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52634</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix disable_otg_wa logic

[Why]
When switching to another HDMI mode, we are unnecesarilly
disabling/enabling FIFO causing both HPO and DIG registers to be set at
the same time when only HPO is supposed to be set.

This can lead to a system hang the next time we change refresh rates as
there are cases when we don't disable OTG/FIFO but FIFO is enabled when
it isn't supposed to be.

[How]
Removing the enable/disable FIFO entirely.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:53:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52635 | PM / devfreq: Synchronize devfreq_monitor_[start/stop]</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52635</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM / devfreq: Synchronize devfreq_monitor_[start/stop]

There is a chance if a frequent switch of the governor
done in a loop result in timer list corruption where
timer cancel being done from two place one from
cancel_delayed_work_sync() and followed by expire_timers()
can be seen from the traces[1].

while true
do
        echo "simple_ondemand" &gt; /sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor
        echo "performance" &gt; /sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor
done

It looks to be issue with devfreq driver where
device_monitor_[start/stop] need to synchronized so that
delayed work should get corrupted while it is either
being queued or running or being cancelled.

Let's use polling flag and devfreq lock to synchronize the
queueing the timer instance twice and work data being
corrupted.

In blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), __add_wait_queue() may be re-ordered
with the following blk_mq_get_driver_tag() in case of getting driver
tag failure.

Then in __sbitmap_queue_wake_up(), waitqueue_active() may not observe
the added waiter in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() and wake up nothing, meantime
blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() can't get driver tag successfully.

This issue can be reproduced by running the following test in loop, and
fio hang can be observed in &lt; 30min when running it on my test VM
in laptop.

	modprobe -r scsi_debug
	modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dev_size_mb=4096 max_queue=1 host_max_queue=1 submit_queues=4
	dev=`ls -d /sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/adapter*/host*/target*/*/block/* | head -1 | xargs basename`
	fio --filename=/dev/"$dev" --direct=1 --rw=randrw --bs=4k --iodepth=1 \
       		--runtime=100 --numjobs=40 --time_based --name=test \
        	--ioengine=libaio

Fix the issue by adding one explicit barrier in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), which
is just fine in case of running out of tag.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:53:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26672 | drm/amdgpu: Fix variable &amp;#x27;mca_funcs&amp;#x27; dereferenced before NULL check in &amp;#x27;amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry()&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26672</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

arm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD

Currently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't
quite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit
memory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.

The ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to
handle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,
which are described in:

* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en
* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en

In both cases the workaround is described as:

| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the
| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected
| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:
|
| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including
|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.
|
| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.

The important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed "after all
explicit memory accesses".

Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by
an LDR, as we have:

| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
| 	eret
| alternative_else_nop_endif
|
| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]

This patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB
immediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.

The ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives
cannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for
ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch
to skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:

| alternative_insn "b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]
| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@:
|
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
|
| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| 	eret

The new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is
not in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the
erratum:

| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the
| issue from occurring.

... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround
is only necessary "If pagetable isolation is disabled".</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:46:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52630 | blk-iocost: Fix an UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52630</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iocost: Fix an UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning

When iocg_kick_delay() is called from a CPU different than the one which set
the delay, @now may be in the past of @iocg-&gt;delay_at leading to the
following warning:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1359:23
  shift exponent 18446744073709 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')

The underflow itself doesn't really affect the behavior in any meaningful
way; however, the past timestamp may exaggerate the delay amount calculated
later in the code, which shouldn't be a material problem given the nature of
the delay mechanism.

If @now is in the past, this CPU is racing another CPU which recently set up
the delay and there's nothing this CPU can contribute w.r.t. the delay.
Let's bail early from iocg_kick_delay() in such cases.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52631 | fs/ntfs3: Fix an NULL dereference bug</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52631</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix an NULL dereference bug

The issue here is when this is called from ntfs_load_attr_list().  The
"size" comes from le32_to_cpu(attr-&gt;res.data_size) so it can't overflow
on a 64bit systems but on 32bit systems the "+ 1023" can overflow and
the result is zero.  This means that the kmalloc will succeed by
returning the ZERO_SIZE_PTR and then the memcpy() will crash with an

xhci: handle isoc Babble and Buffer Overrun events properly

xHCI 4.9 explicitly forbids assuming that the xHC has released its
ownership of a multi-TRB TD when it reports an error on one of the
early TRBs. Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD,
allowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.

The xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC
flag being set by us, regardless of prior errors. This event cannot
be recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier, resulting in
"Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD" error message.

Fix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc Transaction Errors.
This also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.

Fix transfer length reporting on Babble errors. They may be caused by
device malfunction, no guarantee that the buffer has been filled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26660 | drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN301</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26660</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN301

'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers
structures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding
to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 &lt;= 5 below, is indicating that
there is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is
out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior

Here, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If
eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the
stream_enc_regs array.

Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn301_stream_encoder_create

The cause of this issue is that when tipc_nl_bearer_add() is called with
the TIPC_NLA_BEARER_UDP_OPTS attribute, tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() is called
even if the bearer is not UDP.

tipc_udp_is_known_peer() called by tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() assumes that
the media_ptr field of the tipc_bearer has an udp_bearer type object, so
the function goes crazy for non-UDP bearers.

This patch fixes the issue by checking the bearer type before calling
tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() in tipc_nl_bearer_add().</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:31:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26664 | hwmon: (coretemp) Fix out-of-bounds memory access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26664</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free bug

The bug can be triggered by sending a single amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with an invalid address and size.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung &lt;joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr&gt;.
For example the following code:

static void Syzkaller1(int fd)
{
	struct drm_amdgpu_gem_userptr arg;
	int ret;

	arg.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;
	arg.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/
	arg.flags = 0x7;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, &amp;arg);
}

Due to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in
amdgpu_hmm_register-&gt;mmu_interval_notifier_insert-&gt;__mmu_interval_notifier_insert-&gt;
check_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call
amdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.

    }

The ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS without previously submitted job could be assumed that
the error should be returned, but the following commit 1decbf6bb0b4dc56c9da6c5e57b994ebfc2be3aa
modified the logic and allowed to have sched_rq equal to NULL.

As a result when there is no job the ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS returns success.
The change fixes null-ptr-deref in init entity and the stack below demonstrates
the error condition:

usb: misc: ljca: Fix double free in error handling path

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function ljca_auxdev_release
calls kfree(auxdev-&gt;dev.platform_data) to free the parameter data
of the function ljca_new_client_device. The callers of
ljca_new_client_device shouldn't call kfree() again
in the error handling path to free the platform data.

Fix this by cleaning up the redundant kfree() in all callers and
adding kfree() the passed in platform_data on errors which happen
before auxiliary_device_init() succeeds .</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 08:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26654 | ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26654</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard-&gt;timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard-&gt;timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
 ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                 |    mod_timer()
  flush_work()                   |
  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
  kfree(dreamcastcard-&gt;channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker
  ...                            |    dreamcastcard-&gt;channel-&gt; //USE

In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 08:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2016-15038 | NUUO NVRmini 2 deletefile.php path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-15038</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in NUUO NVRmini 2 up to 3.0.8.

The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the "ignores" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 02:20:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28895 | 'Yahoo!
