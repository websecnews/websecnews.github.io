The net device has been unregistered, since the rcu grace period,
unregistration must be run before ieee802154_if_remove.

To avoid this issue, add a check for local-&gt;interfaces before deleting

vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]

Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()
when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached
links), but we shouldn't.

Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have
more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0
(no space, no data available) but with a warning.

This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state
and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21667 | iomap: avoid avoid truncating 64-bit offset to 32 bits</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21667</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,
we must discard any packets received because they are not expected
and would cause issues when we access vsk-&gt;transport.

A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,
where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second
connect() failed, we can find `vsk-&gt;transport` at NULL, leading to a
NULL pointer dereference.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21670 | vsock/bpf: return early if transport is not assigned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21670</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot reported a lock held when returning to userspace[1].  This is
because if argc is less than 0 and the function returns directly, the held

Fix this by store the error in ret and jump to done to clean up instead of
returning directly.

net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

The fec_enet_update_cbd function calls page_pool_dev_alloc_pages but did
not handle the case when it returned NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory
pressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some
frequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an
imx6q.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve
the problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver
ignores the memory allocation error and can crash.

This commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21677 | pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket&amp;#x27;s netns dismantle.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21677</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns dismantle.

pfcp_newlink() links the device to a list in dev_net(dev) instead
of net, where a udp tunnel socket is created.

Even when net is removed, the device stays alive on dev_net(dev).
Then, removing net triggers the splat below. [0]

In this example, pfcp0 is created in ns2, but the udp socket is
created in ns1.

  ip netns add ns1
  ip netns add ns2
  ip -n ns1 link add netns ns2 name pfcp0 type pfcp
  ip netns del ns1

Let's link the device to the socket's netns instead.

Now, pfcp_net_exit() needs another netdev iteration to remove
all pfcp devices in the netns.

pfcp_dev_list is not used under RCU, so the list API is converted
to the non-RCU variant.

pfcp_net_exit() can be converted to .exit_batch_rtnl() in net-next.

openvswitch: fix lockup on tx to unregistering netdev with carrier

Commit in a fixes tag attempted to fix the issue in the following
sequence of calls:

    do_output
    -&gt; ovs_vport_send
       -&gt; dev_queue_xmit
          -&gt; __dev_queue_xmit
             -&gt; netdev_core_pick_tx
                -&gt; skb_tx_hash

When device is unregistering, the 'dev-&gt;real_num_tx_queues' goes to
zero and the 'while (unlikely(hash &gt;= qcount))' loop inside the
'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.

But unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to
fix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering
state while reporting carrier status OK.

One example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON
on start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.
And it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.
Therefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit
the infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There
might be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is
important for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a
packet sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the
issue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.

Fix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running
state is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers
unregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets
to devices that are not running anyway.

While only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier
check is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined
throughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions
like __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit
a packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21682 | eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-deref</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21682</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-deref

Recalculate features when XDP is detached.

Before:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: off [requested on]

After:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: on

The fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is just
a minor annoyance. The real issue is that the features will randomly
come back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invoke
netdev_update_features(). The driver doesn't handle reconfiguring
two things at a time very robustly.

Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 ("bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()") we only reconfigure the RSS hash table
if the "effective" number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO is
enabled "effective" number of rings is 2x what user sees.
So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement "pending"
after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO rings
doing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out,
and the:

  if (old_rx_rings != bp-&gt;hw_resc.resv_rx_rings &amp;&amp;

condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.
The RSS map won't get updated, and we'll crash with:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000168
  RIP: 0010:__bnxt_hwrm_vnic_set_rss+0x13a/0x1a0

    bnxt_open_nic+0x2b/0x60
    ethtool_set_channels+0x18c/0x1d0

As we try to access a freed ring.

The issue is present since XDP support was added, really, but
prior to commit 98ba1d931f61 ("bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()") it wasn't causing major issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21683 | bpf: Fix bpf_sk_select_reuseport() memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix bpf_sk_select_reuseport() memory leak

As pointed out in the original comment, lookup in sockmap can return a TCP
ESTABLISHED socket. Such TCP socket may have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF
set before it was ESTABLISHED. In other words, a non-NULL sk_reuseport_cb
does not imply a non-refcounted socket.

Drop sk's reference in both error paths.

Lookup tables, whose length is not divisible by 26 = floor(num_routed_wires / 3) always include the 0 -&gt; 0 input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can always prove that f(0) = 0 for any lookup table f (unless its length happens to be divisible by 26). The cause of problem is that the LookupTableGate-s are padded with zeros. A workaround from the user side is to extend the table (by repeating some entries) so that its length becomes divisible by 26.

By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover, the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:16:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24784 | kubewarden-controller has an Information leak via AdmissionPolicyGroup Resource</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24784</link><description>kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. The policy group feature, added to by the 1.17.0 release. By being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own. Kubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “context aware“. Context aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount. The AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies. This could allow an attacker to obtain information about resources that are out of their reach, by leveraging a higher access to the cluster granted to the ServiceAccount token used to run the policy. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges that have been granted to the ServiceAccount used to run the Policy Server and assumes that users are using the recommended best practices of keeping the Policy Server's ServiceAccount least privileged. By default, the Kubewarden helm chart grants access to the following resources (cluster wide) only: Namespace, Pod, Deployment and Ingress. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.21.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 15:50:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22219 | VMware Aria Operations for Logs stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2025-22219)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22219</link><description>VMware Aria Operations for Logs contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. A malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to inject a malicious script that  (can perform stored cross-site scripting) may lead to arbitrary operations as admin user.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 15:36:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22220 | VMware Aria Operations for Logs broken access control vulnerability (CVE-2025-22220)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22220</link><description>VMware Aria Operations for Logs contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious actor with non-administrative privileges and network access to Aria Operations for Logs API may be able to perform certain operations in the context of an admin user.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 15:36:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22221 | VMware Aria Operations for Logs stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2025-22221)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22221</link><description>VMware Aria Operation for Logs contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. A malicious actor with admin privileges to VMware Aria Operations for Logs may be able to inject a malicious script that could be executed in a victim's browser when performing a delete action in the Agent Configuration.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 15:36:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22222 | VMware Aria Operations information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-22222)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22222</link><description>VMware Aria Operations contains an information disclosure vulnerability. A malicious user with non-administrative privileges may exploit this vulnerability to retrieve credentials for an outbound plugin if a valid service credential ID is known.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 15:36:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23216 | Argo CD does not scrub secret values from patch errors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23216</link><description>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

A NFS server that exports a cd9660, tarfs, or ext2fs file system can be made to panic by mounting and accessing the export with an NFS client.  Further exploitation (e.g., bypassing file permission checking or remote kernel code execution) is potentially possible, though this has not been demonstrated.  In particular, release kernels are compiled with stack protection enabled, and some instances of the overflow are caught by this mechanism, causing a panic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 04:57:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0374 | Unprivileged access to system files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0374</link><description>When etcupdate encounters conflicts while merging files, it saves a version containing conflict markers in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.
