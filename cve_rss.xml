LoongArch: KVM: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context

Like commit 2c0d278f3293f ("KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard
interrupt context") and commit 9090825fa9974 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Let the
timer expire in hardirq context on RT"), On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels
unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft interrupt expiry mode by default.
Then the timers are canceled from an preempt-notifier which is invoked
with disabled preemption which is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT.

The timer callback is short so in could be invoked in hard-IRQ context.
So let the timer expire on hard-IRQ context even on -RT.

This fix a "scheduling while atomic" bug for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels:

afs: Fix lock recursion

afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it
is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the -&gt;notify_lock, but it tries to
take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but
if the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must
be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through
rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the
-&gt;notify_lock again.

This case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops
looks something like:

virtio_pci: Fix admin vq cleanup by using correct info pointer

vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs() clean up admin vq

We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the

wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that
action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the

smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while
reconnecting to a server.  [0]

The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers
in non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but
it was always while the pod was dying.

The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.

CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that
the socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is
always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.

The repro steps are roughly:

  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns
  2. drop packets from the netns
  3. destroy the netns
  4. unmount CIFS

We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see
the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.

When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime
without holding refcnt due to async timers.

Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit
9744d2bf1976 ("smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().").

Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to
clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a
freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().

Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because
the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same
address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.
When no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\.`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:29:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53432 | While parsing certain malformed PLY files, PCL version 1.14.1 crashes due to an uncaught std::out_of_range exception in PCLPointCloud2::at. ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53432</link><description>While parsing certain malformed PLY files, PCL version 1.14.1 crashes due to an uncaught std::out_of_range exception in PCLPointCloud2::at.

Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52309 | SFTPGo allows administrators to restrict command execution from the EventManager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52309</link><description>SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45194 | In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45194</link><description>In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. An attacker with administrative access to the Zimbra Administration Panel can inject malicious JavaScript code while configuring an email account. This injected code is stored on the server and executed in the context of the victim's browser when interacting with specific elements in the web interface. (The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly sanitizing input parameters to prevent the injection of malicious code.)</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:09:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52799 | Argo Workflows Chart: Excessive Privileges in Workflow Role</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52799</link><description>Argo Workflows Chart is used to set up argo and its needed dependencies through one command. Prior to 0.44.0, the workflow-role has excessive privileges, the worst being create pods/exec, which will allow kubectl exec into any Pod in the same namespace, i.e. arbitrary code execution within those Pods. If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their whole namespace can be compromised. This affects versions of the argo-workflows Chart that use appVersion: 3.4 and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor in those versions. This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.44.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:09:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45513 | An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) through 10.1.

First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion.

Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7. No known workarounds for the vulnerability are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:37:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45663 | IBM Db2 denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45663</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) 11.1 and 11.5 is vulnerable to a denial of service as the server may crash under certain conditions with a specially crafted query.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52755 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.26A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the host_ip parameter in the ipsec_road_asp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52755</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.26A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the host_ip parameter in the ipsec_road_asp function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:57:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51151 | D-Link DI-8200 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to remote command execution in the msp_info_htm function via the flag parameter and cmd parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51151</link><description>D-Link DI-8200 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to remote command execution in the msp_info_htm function via the flag parameter and cmd parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:50:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9875 | Okta Privileged Access server agent (SFTD) versions 1.82.0 to 1.84.0 are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability when the sudo comm...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9875</link><description>Okta Privileged Access server agent (SFTD) versions 1.82.0 to 1.84.0 are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability when the sudo command bundles feature is enabled.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:31:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52581 | Litestar allows unbounded resource consumption (DoS vulnerability)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52581</link><description>Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 2.13.0, the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large files wrapped in a `multipart/form-data` request and cause excessive memory consumption on the server. The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design. The public method signature as well as its implementation both expect the entire request body to be available as a single byte string. It is not possible to accept large file uploads in a safe way using this parser. This may be a regression, as a variation of this issue was already reported in CVE-2023-25578. Limiting the part number is not sufficient to prevent out-of-memory errors on the server. A patch is available in version 2.13.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:54:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52765 | H3C GR-1800AX MiniGRW1B0V100R007 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via the aspForm parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52765</link><description>H3C GR-1800AX MiniGRW1B0V100R007 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via the aspForm parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48531 | A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the Rental Availability module of eSoft Planner 3.24.08271-USA allows attackers to e...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48531</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the Rental Availability module of eSoft Planner 3.24.08271-USA allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser via injecting a crafted payload.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:40:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48533 | A discrepancy between responses for valid and invalid e-mail accounts in the Forgot your Login?

Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there.

When parsing hci reports, the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report, uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report, etc. In doing this, it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not, however, validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible, though unlikely, that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied, it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:30:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48986 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. Certain events cause a callback, the logic for which allocates a buffer (the length of which is determined by looking up the event type in a table). The subsequent write operation, however, copies the amount of data specified in the packet header, which may lead to a buffer overflow.

Zimbra Webmail (Modern UI) is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to improper sanitization of user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into specific fields of an e-mail message. When the victim adds the attacker to their contacts, the malicious code is stored and executed when viewing the contact list. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary mail sending, mailbox exfiltration, profile picture alteration, and other malicious actions. Proper sanitization and escaping of input fields are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48983 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet header. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier plus the header length. WsfMsgAlloc then increments this again by sizeof(wsfMsg_t). This may cause an integer overflow that results in the buffer being significantly too small to contain the entire packet. This may cause a buffer overflow of up to 65 KB . This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48985 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large, no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state, where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48981 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet header by looking up the identifying first byte and matching it against a table of possible lengths. The initial parsing function, hciTrSerialRxIncoming does not drop packets with invalid identifiers but also does not set a safe default for the length of unknown packets' headers, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to a not-yet-allocated buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which state of packet parsing is currently occurring. Because the buffer is allocated when the last byte of the header has been copied, the combination of having a bad header length variable that will never match the counter variable and being able to overwrite the state variable with the resulting buffer overflow can be used to advance the function to the next step while skipping the buffer allocation and resulting pointer write. The next 16 bytes from the packet body are then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52754 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the fn parameter in the tgfile_htm function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52754</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the fn parameter in the tgfile_htm function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:48:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52757 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the notify parameter in the arp_sys_asp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52757</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the notify parameter in the arp_sys_asp function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:48:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33439 | An issue in Kasda LinkSmart Router KW5515 v1.7 and before allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands via cgi p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33439</link><description>An issue in Kasda LinkSmart Router KW5515 v1.7 and before allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands via cgi parameters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:53:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45511 | An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) through 10.1.

Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52597 | 2FAuth vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via SVG upload and direct access render</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52597</link><description>2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Versions prior to 5.4.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting due to improper headers in direct access to uploaded SVGs. The application allows uploading images in several places. One of the accepted types of image is SVG, which allows JS scripting. Therefore, by uploading a malicious SVG which contains JS code, an attacker which is able to drive a victim to the uploaded image could compromise that victim's session and access to their tokens. Version 5.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10913 | Clone &amp;lt;= 2.4.6 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection via &amp;#x27;recursive_unserialized_replace&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10913</link><description>The Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'recursive_unserialized_replace' function.

Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;`, `&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;` and `&lt;noscript&gt;`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;`, `&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;` and `&lt;noscript&gt;`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 21:40:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2018-9420 | In BnCameraService::onTransact of CameraService.cpp, there is a possible information disclosure due to uninitialized data.

mm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking

Recent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:
under load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,
"Bad page state"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually
don't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent
changes being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,
improved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.

Before fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),
which does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),
which is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm
internals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to
check usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,
which can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing
callers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).

Just omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all
of whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()
will tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no
longer has any callers (and will be deleted separately).

Swapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio-&gt;memcg_data 0
without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;
which is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg
(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,
when freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially
corrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0
here, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before
resetting memcg_data.

That goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 ("mm: thp: make deferred split
shrinker memcg aware"): which included a check on swapcache before adding
to deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to
swapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim
(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue
could have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 ("mm: split
underused THPs") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes
swapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.

Keep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is
no longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely
to be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the
queue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.

Memcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing
folio-&gt;memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the
deferred list, sometimes corrupting "from" memcg's list, like swapout. 
Refcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be
used in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:
mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting
of course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving
charge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:
nobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.

The 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list
to another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);
but that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 ("mm: thp: don't need care
deferred split queue in memcg charge move path"), which argued that the
existence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred
list.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.

Backport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take
care that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There
is not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53080 | drm/panthor: Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53080</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: Break an object reference loop

When remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,
outstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, due
to an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (or
set of objects) referencing the object below it:

    PVR GEM Object
    GPU scheduler "finished" fence
    GPU scheduler âscheduledâ fence
    PVR driver âdoneâ fence
    PVR Context
    PVR VM Context
    PVR VM Mappings
    PVR GEM Object

The reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is a
soft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappings
is done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts are
involved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.

To break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstanding
VM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with the
VM context.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53085 | tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53085</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first

Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy
according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while
the operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of
this behaviour.

Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip-&gt;flags both
in tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED
check inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:49:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10224 | Qualys discovered that if unsanitized input was used with the library Modules::ScanDeps, before version 1.36 a local attacker could possibly...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10224</link><description>Qualys discovered that if unsanitized input was used with the library Modules::ScanDeps, before version 1.36 a local attacker could possibly execute arbitrary shell commands by open()ing a "pesky pipe" (such as passing "commands|" as a filename) or by passing arbitrary strings to eval().</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:42:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11003 | Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, passes unsanitized data to a library (Modules::ScanDeps) which expects safe input.

riscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodes

When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node
at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a
specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for
the node that was acquired.

Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we
can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and
we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.
This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.

Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring
the device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:42:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53076 | iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53076</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is also needed for High Availability function of the Versa Director. The default configuration has a common password across all instances of Versa Director. By default, Versa Director configures Postgres to listen on all network interfaces. This combination allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and administer the database or read local filesystem contents to escalate privileges on the system. 

Exploitation Status:
Versa Networks is not aware of this exploitation in any production systems. A proof of concept exists in the lab environment.

Workarounds or Mitigation:
Starting with the latest 22.1.4 version of Versa Director, the software will automatically restrict access to the Postgres and HA ports to only the local and peer Versa Directors. For older releases, Versa recommends performing manual hardening of HA ports. Please refer to the following link for the steps https://docs.versa-networks.com/Solutions/System_Hardening/Perform_Manual_Hardening_for_Versa_Director#Secure_HA_Ports  

This vulnerability is not exploitable on Versa Directors if published Firewall guidelines are implemented. We have validated that no Versa-hosted head ends have been affected by this vulnerability. All Versa-hosted head ends are patched and hardened. 

Please contact Versa Technical Support or Versa account team for any further assistance.

resource,kexec: walk_system_ram_res_rev must retain resource flags

walk_system_ram_res_rev() erroneously discards resource flags when passing
the information to the callback.

This causes systems with IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED memory to have
these resources selected during kexec to store kexec buffers if that
memory happens to be at placed above normal system ram.

This leads to undefined behavior after reboot.  If the kexec buffer is
never touched, nothing happens.  If the kexec buffer is touched, it could
lead to a crash (like below) or undefined behavior.

Tested on a system with CXL memory expanders with driver managed memory,
TPM enabled, and CONFIG_IMA_KEXEC=y.  Adding printk's showed the flags
were being discarded and as a result the check for
IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED passes.

Add a lockdep expression to hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() in
ip_tunnel_find() in order to validate that the mutex is held and to
silence the suspicious RCU usage warning [1].

There are code paths from which the function is called without holding

Fix by using l3mdev_master_upper_ifindex_by_index() which will acquire
the RCU read lock before calling

net/sched: sch_api: fix xa_insert() error path in tcf_block_get_ext()

This command:

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: block dev insert failed: -EBUSY.

fails because user space requests the same block index to be set for
both ingress and egress.

[ side note, I don't think it even failed prior to commit 913b47d3424e
  ("net/sched: Introduce tc block netdev tracking infra"), because this
  is a command from an old set of notes of mine which used to work, but
  alas, I did not scientifically bisect this ]

The problem is not that it fails, but rather, that the second time
around, it fails differently (and irrecoverably):

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

[ another note: the extack is added by me for illustration purposes.
  the context of the problem is that clsact_init() obtains the same
  &amp;amp;q-&gt;ingress_block pointer as &amp;amp;q-&gt;egress_block, and since we call
  tcf_block_get_ext() on both of them, "dev" will be added to the
  block-&gt;ports xarray twice, thus failing the operation: once through
  the ingress block pointer, and once again through the egress block
  pointer. the problem itself is that when xa_insert() fails, we have
  emitted a FLOW_BLOCK_BIND command through ndo_setup_tc(), but the
  offload never sees a corresponding FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND. ]

Even correcting the bad user input, we still cannot recover:

$ tc qdisc replace dev swp3 ingress_block 1 egress_block 2 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

Basically the only way to recover is to reboot the system, or unbind and
rebind the net device driver.

To fix the bug, we need to fill the correct error teardown path which
was missed during code movement, and call tcf_block_offload_unbind()
when xa_insert() fails.

[ last note, fundamentally I blame the label naming convention in
  tcf_block_get_ext() for the bug. The labels should be named after what
  they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is
  obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean
  something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site
  is also easier ]</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53045 | ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53045</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create

The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by
attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This
attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with
list_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for
allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of
added elements after the array is filled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53046 | arm64: dts: imx8ulp: correct the flexspi compatible string</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53046</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM

The E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intel
provides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final
product design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static
values defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design.
Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe
of the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:

The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected
and defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.

Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL
subsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.

Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on "per HW
design" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically
acquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for
next-tree only.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53049 | slub/kunit: fix a WARNING due to unwrapped __kmalloc_cache_noprof</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in
turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.

Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't
something that can be triggered by a regular user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53053 | scsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53053</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue can be reproduced by the following pressuse test:
1. A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.
2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.
3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.
The scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.

The reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are
acquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.
It can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:
1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a
   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active
   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are
   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put
   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in
   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.
2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put
   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled
   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has
   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier
   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.
3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.
4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into
   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.
   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will
   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.
   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.
5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are
   cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as
   a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be
   executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being
   blocked, forming a deadlock.

system_wq(step1)		WatchDog(step2)			cpu offline(step3)	cgroup_destroy_wq(step4)
...
2000+ cgroups deleted asyn
256 actives + n inactives

..blocking...

To fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicated
workqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem. System wqs are
for misc things which shouldn't create a large number of concurrent work
items. If something is going to generate &gt;

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction

If more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all
APs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scan
construction will loop forever since the loop variable
has type u8, which can never reach the number found when
that's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable.
Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.

Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in
the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR
entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan
results, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's
more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11,
we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in
the bounds of a u32.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53056 | drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53056</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT

In qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed
to be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid
to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:
Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active
class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.

In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress
qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent
TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a
hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into
qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).

In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree
levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the
iteration must stop.

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q-&gt;tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

Although this case may be unrealistic for the current code, it is
still better to protect against possible bugs.

Bail out also when status is AE_NOT_FOUND.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53064 | idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53064</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path

In an event where the platform running the device control plane
is rebooted, reset is detected on the driver. It releases
all the resources and waits for the reset to complete. Once the
reset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At this
time if the device control plane is not yet started, then
the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to
establish the mailbox again.

In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox
workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message.
This results in accessing the released control queue leading to
null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation
and mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they got
initialized.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53065 | mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53065</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create

Commit b035f5a6d852 ("mm: slab: reduce the kmalloc() minimum alignment
if DMA bouncing possible") reduced ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN to 8 on arm64.
However, with KASAN_HW_TAGS enabled, arch_slab_minalign() becomes 16.
This causes kmalloc_caches[*][8] to be aliased to kmalloc_caches[*][16],
resulting in kmem_buckets_create() attempting to create a kmem_cache for
size 16 twice. This duplication triggers warnings on boot:

drm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flags

The current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:

1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,
   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear
   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping
   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.
   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:
   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and
   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the
   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing
   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*
   flushes happen.

2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are
   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).
   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has
   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but
   fairly cursed.
   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs
   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()
   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into
   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault
   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so
   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when
   it hits a BUG() check.

Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID
doesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for
the FLUSH_ID don't make sense).

Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing
list; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.

Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't
have a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it
before applying it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53072 | platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available

Loading the amd_pmc module as:

    amd_pmc enable_stb=1

...can result in the following messages in the kernel ring buffer:

    amd_pmc AMDI0009:00: SMU cmd failed. err: 0xff
    ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000000000000 - 0x0000000000ffffff
    WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 2151 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:217 __ioremap_caller+0x2cd/0x340

Further debugging reveals that this occurs when the requests for
S2D_PHYS_ADDR_LOW and S2D_PHYS_ADDR_HIGH return a value of 0,
indicating that the STB is inaccessible. To prevent the ioremap
warning and provide clarity to the user, handle the invalid address
and display an error message.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48070 | Weaver Ecology v9* was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48070</link><description>Weaver Ecology v9* was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48071 | An issue in the component /importmould/deletefolder of Weaver Ecology v9.* allows authenticated attackers to execute a directory traversal a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48071</link><description>An issue in the component /importmould/deletefolder of Weaver Ecology v9.* allows authenticated attackers to execute a directory traversal and arbitrarily delete files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:51:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43338 | WordPress Crowdsignal Polls &amp;amp; Ratings plugin &amp;lt;= 3.1.2 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43338</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Automattic, Inc.

Prior to version 5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets` fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible. This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52789 | Tenda W30E v2.0 V16.01.0.8 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability in /etc_ro/shadow, which allows attackers to log in ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52789</link><description>Tenda W30E v2.0 V16.01.0.8 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability in /etc_ro/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52788 | Tenda W9 v1.0.0.7(4456) was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability in /etc_ro/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52788</link><description>Tenda W9 v1.0.0.7(4456) was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability in /etc_ro/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50803 | The mediapool feature of the Redaxo Core CMS application v 5.17.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting(XSS) which allows a remote attacker ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50803</link><description>The mediapool feature of the Redaxo Core CMS application v 5.17.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting(XSS) which allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:14:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52582 | cachi2 allows traceback prints locals</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52582</link><description>Cachi2 is a command-line interface tool that pre-fetches a project's dependencies to aid in making the project's build process network-isolated.

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for customizing behavior, and includes ConfigProvider plugins in order to manipulate these configurations. Apache Kafka also provides FileConfigProvider, DirectoryConfigProvider, and EnvVarConfigProvider implementations which include the ability to read from disk or environment variables.
In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use these ConfigProviders to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables.

In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products.
This issue affects Apache Kafka Clients: from 2.3.0 through 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.0.


Users with affected applications are recommended to upgrade kafka-clients to version &gt;=3.8.0, and set the JVM system property "org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none".
Users of Kafka Connect with one of the listed ConfigProvider implementations specified in their worker config are also recommended to add appropriate "allowlist.pattern" and "allowed.paths" to restrict their operation to appropriate bounds.


For users of Kafka Clients or Kafka Connect in environments that trust users with disk and environment variable access, it is not recommended to set the system property.
For users of the Kafka Broker, Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0, Kafka Streams, and Kafka command-line tools, it is not recommended to set the system property.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 08:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10268 | MP3 Audio Player â Music Player, Podcast Player &amp;amp; Radio by Sonaar &amp;lt;= 5.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sonaar_audioplayer Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10268</link><description>The MP3 Audio Player â Music Player, Podcast Player &amp; Radio by Sonaar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's sonaar_audioplayer shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
