A user with permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission) can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/&lt;uuid&gt;/`) and/or the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/&lt;uuid&gt;/members/`) to list the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group. In versions of Nautobot between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive, and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device` permissions or lack thereof. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.23 and 2.2.5. Users are advised to upgrade. This vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users however a full fix will require upgrading.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 22:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-30314 | An issue discovered in 360 V6G, 360 T5G, 360 T6M, and 360 P1 routers allows attackers to hijack TCP sessions which could lead to a denial of...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30314</link><description>An issue discovered in 360 V6G, 360 T5G, 360 T6M, and 360 P1 routers allows attackers to hijack TCP sessions which could lead to a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 21:47:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-30312 | An issue discovered in routers running Openwrt 18.06, 19.07, 21.02, 22.03 and beyond allows attackers to hijack TCP sessions which could lea...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30312</link><description>An issue discovered in routers running Openwrt 18.06, 19.07, 21.02, 22.03 and beyond allows attackers to hijack TCP sessions which could lead to a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 21:38:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23580 | HCL DRYiCE Optibot Reset Station is impacted by insecure encryption of One-Time Passwords (OTPs)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23580</link><description>HCL DRYiCE Optibot Reset Station is impacted byÂ insecure encryption of One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

information such as  `Last-Modified (of the latest version)`, `Etag (of the latest version)`, `x-amz-version-id (of the latest version)`, `Expires (metadata value of the latest version)`, `Cache-Control (metadata value of the latest version)`. This conditional check was being honored before validating if the anonymous access is indeed allowed on the metadata of an object. This issue has been addressed in commit `e0fe7cc3917`. Users must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix.

Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `"0.0.0.0"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `"::"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:29:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35238 | Denial of service of Minder Server from maliciously crafted GitHub attestations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35238</link><description>Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.

The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:

1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.
2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.
3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35236 | Audiobookshelf Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability via crafted ebooks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35236</link><description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35237 | MIT IdentiBot User-Kerberos Mapping Publicly Available</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35237</link><description>MIT IdentiBot is an open-source Discord bot written in Node.js that verifies individuals' affiliations with MIT, grants them roles in a Discord server, and stores information about them in a database backend. A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a "public" Discord applicationâi.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e). There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch. To prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, all vulnerable instances of IdentiBot should be taken offline until they have been updated.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 17:17:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35231 | rack-contrib vulnerable to Denial of Service due to the unconstrained value of the incoming &amp;quot;profiler_runs&amp;quot; parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35231</link><description>rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web server interface.
