Matthew has analyzed the report and identified that in drain_page_zone()
we are in a section protected by spin_lock(&amp;amp;pcp-&gt;lock) and then get an
interrupt that attempts spin_trylock() on the same lock.  The code is
designed to work this way without disabling IRQs and occasionally fail the
trylock with a fallback.  However, the SMP=n spinlock implementation
assumes spin_trylock() will always succeed, and thus it's normally a
no-op.  Here the enabled lock debugging catches the problem, but otherwise
it could cause a corruption of the pcp structure.

The problem has been introduced by commit 574907741599 ("mm/page_alloc:
leave IRQs enabled for per-cpu page allocations").  The pcp locking scheme
recognizes the need for disabling IRQs to prevent nesting spin_trylock()
sections on SMP=n, but the need to prevent the nesting in spin_lock() has
not been recognized.  Fix it by introducing local wrappers that change the
spin_lock() to spin_lock_iqsave() with SMP=n and use them in all places
that do spin_lock(&amp;amp;pcp-&gt;lock).

dmaengine: qcom: gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()

Fix a memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config() where the original memory
pointed to by gchan-&gt;config could be lost if krealloc() fails.

The issue occurs when:
1. gchan-&gt;config points to previously allocated memory
2. krealloc() fails and returns NULL
3. The function directly assigns NULL to gchan-&gt;config, losing the
   reference to the original memory
4. The original memory becomes unreachable and cannot be freed

Fix this by using a temporary variable to hold the krealloc() result
and only updating gchan-&gt;config when the allocation succeeds.

Found via static analysis and code review.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23027 | LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23027</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

In gs_can_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the
parent-&gt;rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), the URB is processed and resubmitted. In
gs_can_close() the URBs are freed by calling
usb_kill_anchored_urbs(parent-&gt;rx_submitted).

However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
released in gs_can_close().

Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to the parent-&gt;rx_submitted anchor.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23032 | null_blk: fix kmemleak by releasing references to fault configfs items</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23032</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

null_blk: fix kmemleak by releasing references to fault configfs items

When CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NULL_BLK_FAULT_INJECTION is enabled, the null-blk
driver sets up fault injection support by creating the timeout_inject,
requeue_inject, and init_hctx_fault_inject configfs items as children
of the top-level nullbX configfs group.

However, when the nullbX device is removed, the references taken to
these fault-config configfs items are not released. As a result,
kmemleak reports a memory leak, for example:

drm/amdgpu/userq: Fix fence reference leak on queue teardown v2

The user mode queue keeps a pointer to the most recent fence in
userq-&gt;last_fence. This pointer holds an extra dma_fence reference.

When the queue is destroyed, we free the fence driver and its xarray,
but we forgot to drop the last_fence reference.

Because of the missing dma_fence_put(), the last fence object can stay
alive when the driver unloads. This leaves an allocated object in the
amdgpu_userq_fence slab cache and triggers

This is visible during driver unload as:

  BUG amdgpu_userq_fence: Objects remaining on __kmem_cache_shutdown()
  kmem_cache_destroy amdgpu_userq_fence: Slab cache still has objects
  Call Trace:
    kmem_cache_destroy
    amdgpu_userq_fence_slab_fini
    amdgpu_exit
    __do_sys_delete_module

Fix this by putting userq-&gt;last_fence and clearing the pointer during
amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_free().

This makes sure the fence reference is released and the slab cache is
empty when the module exits.

v2: Update to only release userq-&gt;last_fence with dma_fence_put()

btrfs: release path before iget_failed() in btrfs_read_locked_inode()

In btrfs_read_locked_inode() if we fail to lookup the inode, we jump to
the 'out' label with a path that has a read locked leaf and then we call
iget_failed(). This can result in a ABBA deadlock, since iget_failed()
triggers inode eviction and that causes the release of the delayed inode,
which must lock the delayed inode's mutex, and a task updating a delayed
inode starts by taking the node's mutex and then modifying the inode's
subvolume btree.

Syzbot reported the following lockdep splat for this:

can: etas_es58x: allow partial RX URB allocation to succeed

When es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() fails to allocate the requested number of
URBs but succeeds in allocating some, it returns an error code.
This causes es58x_open() to return early, skipping the cleanup label
'free_urbs', which leads to the anchored URBs being leaked.

As pointed out by maintainer Vincent Mailhol, the driver is designed
to handle partial URB allocation gracefully. Therefore, partial
allocation should not be treated as a fatal error.

Modify es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() to return 0 if at least one URB has been
allocated, restoring the intended behavior and preventing the leak
in es58x_open().</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23038 | pnfs/flexfiles: Fix memory leak in nfs4_ff_alloc_deviceid_node()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23038</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: always detect conflicting inodes when logging inode refs

After rename exchanging (either with the rename exchange operation or
regular renames in multiple non-atomic steps) two inodes and at least
one of them is a directory, we can end up with a log tree that contains
only of the inodes and after a power failure that can result in an attempt
to delete the other inode when it should not because it was not deleted
before the power failure. In some case that delete attempt fails when
the target inode is a directory that contains a subvolume inside it, since
the log replay code is not prepared to deal with directory entries that
point to root items (only inode items).

1) We have directories "dir1" (inode A) and "dir2" (inode B) under the
   same parent directory;

2) We have a file (inode C) under directory "dir1" (inode A);

3) We have a subvolume inside directory "dir2" (inode B);

4) All these inodes were persisted in a past transaction and we are
   currently at transaction N;

5) We rename the file (inode C), so at btrfs_log_new_name() we update
   inode C's last_unlink_trans to N;

6) We get a rename exchange for "dir1" (inode A) and "dir2" (inode B),
   so after the exchange "dir1" is inode B and "dir2" is inode A.
   During the rename exchange we call btrfs_log_new_name() for inodes
   A and B, but because they are directories, we don't update their
   last_unlink_trans to N;

7) An fsync against the file (inode C) is done, and because its inode
   has a last_unlink_trans with a value of N we log its parent directory
   (inode A) (through btrfs_log_all_parents(), called from
   btrfs_log_inode_parent()).

8) So we end up with inode B not logged, which now has the old name
   of inode A. At copy_inode_items_to_log(), when logging inode A, we
   did not check if we had any conflicting inode to log because inode
   A has a generation lower than the current transaction (created in
   a past transaction);

9) After a power failure, when replaying the log tree, since we find that
   inode A has a new name that conflicts with the name of inode B in the
   fs tree, we attempt to delete inode B... this is wrong since that
   directory was never deleted before the power failure, and because there
   is a subvolume inside that directory, attempting to delete it will fail
   since replay_dir_deletes() and btrfs_unlink_inode() are not prepared
   to deal with dir items that point to roots instead of inodes.

   When that happens the mount fails and we get a stack trace like the
   following:

btrfs: fix NULL dereference on root when tracing inode eviction

When evicting an inode the first thing we do is to setup tracing for it,
which implies fetching the root's id. But in btrfs_evict_inode() the
root might be NULL, as implied in the next check that we do in
btrfs_evict_inode().

Hence, we either should set the -&gt;root_objectid to 0 in case the root is
NULL, or we move tracing setup after checking that the root is not
NULL. Setting the rootid to 0 at least gives us the possibility to trace
this call even in the case when the root is NULL, so that's the solution
taken here.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23015 | gpio: mpsse: fix reference leak in gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23015</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet: frags: drop fraglist conntrack references

Jakub added a warning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() to make debugging
leaked skbs/conntrack references more obvious.

syzbot reports this as triggering, and I can also reproduce this via
ip_defrag.sh selftest:

 conntrack cleanup blocked for 60s
 WARNING: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:2512
 [..]

conntrack clenups gets stuck because there are skbs with still hold nf_conn
references via their frag_list.

   net.core.skb_defer_max=0 makes the hang disappear.

Eric Dumazet points out that skb_release_head_state() doesn't follow the
fraglist.

ip_defrag.sh can only reproduce this problem since
commit 6471658dc66c ("udp: use skb_attempt_defer_free()"), but AFAICS this
problem could happen with TCP as well if pmtu discovery is off.

The relevant problem path for udp is:
1. netns emits fragmented packets
2. nf_defrag_v6_hook reassembles them (in output hook)
3. reassembled skb is tracked (skb owns nf_conn reference)
4. ip6_output refragments
5. refragmented packets also own nf_conn reference (ip6_fragment
   calls ip6_copy_metadata())
6. on input path, nf_defrag_v6_hook skips defragmentation: the
   fragments already have skb-&gt;nf_conn attached
7. skbs are reassembled via ipv6_frag_rcv()
8. skb_consume_udp -&gt; skb_attempt_defer_free() -&gt; skb ends up
   in pcpu freelist, but still has nf_conn reference.

Possible solutions:
 1 let defrag engine drop nf_conn entry, OR
 2 export kick_defer_list_purge() and call it from the conntrack
   netns exit callback, OR
 3 add skb_has_frag_list() check to skb_attempt_defer_free()

2 &amp; 3 also solve ip_defrag.sh hang but share same drawback:

Such reassembled skbs, queued to socket, can prevent conntrack module
removal until userspace has consumed the packet. While both tcp and udp
stack do call nf_reset_ct() before placing skb on socket queue, that
function doesn't iterate frag_list skbs.

Therefore drop nf_conn entries when they are placed in defrag queue.
Keep the nf_conn entry of the first (offset 0) skb so that reassembled
skb retains nf_conn entry for sake of TX path.

Note that fixes tag is incorrect; it points to the commit introducing the
'ip_defrag.sh reproducible problem': no need to backport this patch to
every stable kernel.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23017 | idpf: fix error handling in the init_task on load</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23017</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

successful driver load, the tasks can still run, as that will allow the
netdevs to attempt recovery through another reset. Stop the PTP callbacks
either way as those will be restarted by the call to idpf_vc_core_init()
during a successful reset.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23018 | btrfs: release path before initializing extent tree in btrfs_read_locked_inode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23018</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: release path before initializing extent tree in btrfs_read_locked_inode()

In btrfs_read_locked_inode() we are calling btrfs_init_file_extent_tree()
while holding a path with a read locked leaf from a subvolume tree, and
btrfs_init_file_extent_tree() may do a GFP_KERNEL allocation, which can
trigger reclaim.

This can create a circular lock dependency which lockdep warns about with
the following splat:

net: marvell: prestera: fix NULL dereference on devlink_alloc() failure

devlink_alloc() may return NULL on allocation failure, but
prestera_devlink_alloc() unconditionally calls devlink_priv() on
the returned pointer.

This leads to a NULL pointer dereference if devlink allocation fails.
Add a check for a NULL devlink pointer and return NULL early to avoid
the crash.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:49:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23020 | net: 3com: 3c59x: fix possible null dereference in vortex_probe1()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23020</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HotCRP versions from October 2025 through January 2026 delivered documents of all types with inline Content-Disposition, causing them to be rendered in the user’s browser rather than downloaded. (The intended behavior was for only `text/plain`, `application/pdf`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/png` to be delivered inline, though adding `save=0` to the document URL could request inline delivery for any document.) This made users who clicked a document link vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. An uploaded HTML or SVG document would run in the viewer’s browser with access to their HotCRP credentials, and Javascript in that document could eventually make arbitrary calls to HotCRP’s API. Malicious documents could be uploaded to submission fields with “file upload” or “attachment” type, or as attachments to comments. PDF upload fields were not vulnerable. A search of documents uploaded to hotcrp.com found no evidence of exploitation. The vulnerability was introduced in commit aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508 (11 October 2025), present in development versions and v3.2, and fixed in commit 8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323 and v3.2.1. Additionally, c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5 and v3.2.1 remove support for `save=0`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:36:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25154 | LocalSend has Stored XSS in Web Share Interface via Filename</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25154</link><description>LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows users to share files and messages with nearby devices over their local network without needing an internet connection.

In versions of @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node prior to 1.13.11 and 1.14.1, when TechDocs is configured with `runIn: local`, a malicious actor who can submit or modify a repository's `mkdocs.yml` file can execute arbitrary Python code on the TechDocs build server via MkDocs hooks configuration. @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node versions 1.13.11 and 1.14.1 contain a fix. The fix introduces an allowlist of supported MkDocs configuration keys. Unsupported configuration keys (including `hooks`) are now removed from `mkdocs.yml` before running the generator, with a warning logged to indicate which keys were removed. Users of `@techdocs/cli` should also upgrade to the latest version, which includes the fixed `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` dependency. Some workarounds are available. Configure TechDocs with `runIn: docker` instead of `runIn: local` to provide container isolation, though it does not fully mitigate the risk. Limit who can modify `mkdocs.yml` files in repositories that TechDocs processes; only allow trusted contributors. Implement PR review requirements for changes to `mkdocs.yml` files to detect malicious `hooks` configurations before they are merged. Use MkDocs &lt; 1.4.0 (e.g., 1.3.1) which does not support hooks. Note: This may limit access to newer MkDocs features. Building documentation in CI/CD pipelines using `@techdocs/cli` does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the CLI uses the same vulnerable `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` package.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:52:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36442 | IBM Db2 Denial of Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36442</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) is vulnerable to a denial of service as the server may crash under certain conditions with a specially crafted query with XML columns.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:34:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1723 | TOTOLINK X6000R Unauthenticated Command Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1723</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in TOTOLINK X6000R allows OS Command Injection.This issue affects X6000R: through V9.4.0cu.1498_B20250826.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24293 | # Active Storage allowed transformation methods potentially unsafe&#13;
&#13;
Active Storage attempts to prevent the use of potentially unsafe image...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24293</link><description># Active Storage allowed transformation methods potentially unsafe

Active Storage attempts to prevent the use of potentially unsafe image
transformation methods and parameters by default.

The default allowed list contains three methods allow for the circumvention
of the safe defaults which enables potential command injection
vulnerabilities in cases where arbitrary user supplied input is accepted as
valid transformation methods or parameters.


Impact
------
This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage with the image_processing processing gem in addition to mini_magick as the image processor.

Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:
```
&lt;%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] =&gt; params[:v]) %&gt;
```

Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary input.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.



Workarounds
-----------
Consuming user supplied input for image transformation methods or their parameters is unsupported behavior and should be considered dangerous.

Strict validation of user supplied methods and parameters should be performed
as well as having a strong [ImageMagick security
policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php) deployed.

Prior to versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19, PsySH automatically loads and executes a `.psysh.php` file from the Current Working Directory (CWD) on startup. If an attacker can write to a directory that a victim later uses as their CWD when launching PsySH, the attacker can trigger arbitrary code execution in the victim's context. When the victim runs PsySH with elevated privileges (e.g., root), this results in local privilege escalation. This is a CWD configuration poisoning issue leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim user’s context. If a privileged user (e.g., root, a CI runner, or an ops/debug account) launches PsySH with CWD set to an attacker-writable directory containing a malicious `.psysh.php`, the attacker can execute commands with that privileged user’s permissions, resulting in local privilege escalation. Downstream consumers that embed PsySH inherit this risk. For example, Laravel Tinker (`php artisan tinker`) uses PsySH. If a privileged user runs Tinker while their shell is in an attacker-writable directory, the `.psysh.php` auto-load behavior can be abused in the same way to execute attacker-controlled code under the victim’s privileges. Versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25130 | Cybersecurity AI vulnerable to command Injection through argument injection in find_file Agent tool</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25130</link><description>Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is a framework for AI Security. In versions up to and including 0.5.10, the CAI (Cybersecurity AI) framework contains multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in its function tools. User-controlled input is passed directly to shell commands via `subprocess.Popen()` with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The `find_file()` tool executes without requiring user approval because find is considered a "safe" pre-approved command. This means an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious arguments (like -exec) into the args parameter, completely bypassing any human-in-the-loop safety mechanisms. Commit e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde contains a fix.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25141 | Orval has a code injection via unsanitized x-enum-descriptions uing JS comments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25141</link><description>Orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification. Versions starting with 7.19.0 and prior to 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 have an incomplete fix for CVE-2026-23947. While the jsStringEscape function properly handles single quotes ('), double quotes (") and so on, it is still possible to achieve code injection using only a limited set of characters that are currently not escaped. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application can be forced to execute arbitrary JavaScript using characters such as []()!+. By using a technique known as JSFuck, an attacker can bypass the current sanitization logic and run arbitrary code without needing any alphanumeric characters or quotes. Version 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 contain an updated fix.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23835 | LobeHub Vulnerable to Improper Authorization in Presigned Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23835</link><description>LobeHub is an open source human-and-AI-agent network. Prior to version 1.143.3, the file upload feature in `Knowledge Base &gt; File Upload` does not validate the integrity of the upload request, allowing users to intercept and modify the request parameters. As a result, it is possible to create arbitrary files in abnormal or unintended paths. In addition, since `lobechat.com` relies on the size parameter from the request to calculate file usage, an attacker can manipulate this value to misrepresent the actual file size, such as uploading a `1 GB` file while reporting it as `10 MB`, or falsely declaring a `10 MB` file as a `1 GB` file. By manipulating the size value provided in the client upload request, it is possible to bypass the monthly upload quota enforced by the server and continuously upload files beyond the intended storage and traffic limits. This abuse can result in a discrepancy between actual resource consumption and billing calculations, causing direct financial impact to the service operator. Additionally, exhaustion of storage or related resources may lead to degraded service availability, including failed uploads, delayed content delivery, or temporary suspension of upload functionality for legitimate users. A single malicious user can also negatively affect other users or projects sharing the same subscription plan, effectively causing an indirect denial of service (DoS). Furthermore, excessive and unaccounted-for uploads can distort monitoring metrics and overload downstream systems such as backup processes, malware scanning, and media processing pipelines, ultimately undermining overall operational stability and service reliability. Version 1.143.3 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11175 | DiscussionTools should use better regex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11175</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') vulnerability in The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - DiscussionTools Extension allows Regular Expression Exponential Blowup.This issue affects Mediawiki - DiscussionTools Extension: 1.44, 1.43.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62348 | Salt junos module uses an unsafe YAML loader which may allow unintended code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62348</link><description>Salt's junos execution module contained an unsafe YAML decode/load usage.

In versions 4.3.6 through 5.3.3, a RangeError vulnerability exists in the numeric entity processing of fast-xml-parser when parsing XML with out-of-range entity code points (e.g., `&amp;#9999999;` or `&amp;#xffffff;`). This causes the parser to throw an uncaught exception, crashing any application that processes untrusted XML input. Version 5.3.4 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:20:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1684 | Free5GC SMF PFCP UDP Endpoint pfcp_reports.go HandleReports denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1684</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Free5GC SMF up to 4.1.0.

The `ig` binary provides a subcommand for image building, used to generate custom gadget OCI images. A part of this functionality is implemented in the file `inspektor-gadget/cmd/common/image/build.go`. The `Makefile.build` file is the Makefile template employed during the building process. This file includes user-controlled data in an unsafe fashion, specifically some parameters are embedded without an adequate escaping in the commands inside the Makefile. Prior to version 0.48.1, this implementation is vulnerable to command injection: an attacker able to control values in the `buildOptions` structure would be able to execute arbitrary commands during the building process. An attacker able to exploit this vulnerability would be able to execute arbitrary command on the Linux host where the `ig` command is launched, if images are built with the `--local` flag or on the build container invoked by `ig`, if the `--local` flag is not provided. The `buildOptions` structure is extracted from the YAML gadget manifest passed to the `ig image build` command. Therefore, the attacker would need a way to control either the full `build.yml` file passed to the `ig image build` command, or one of its options. Typically, this could happen in a CI/CD scenario that builds untrusted gadgets to verify correctness. Version 0.48.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25040 | Budibase Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via API Abuse – Creator Can Invite Users with Admin/Any Role</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25040</link><description>Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin panels.

The published VSCode extension does not include these files and end users are not affected. This is fixed in version 0.1.6 by replacing execSync with execFileSync using array arguments. As a workaround, ensure .vsix files in the project directory have safe filenames before running publish scripts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25047 | deepHas vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via constructor.prototype</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25047</link><description>deepHas provides a test for the existence of a nested object key and optionally returns that key.

In versions up to and including 1.61, wifipcap parses 802.11 management frame elements and performs a length check on the wrong field when handling the TIM element. A crafted frame with a large TIM length can cause a 1-byte out-of-bounds write past `tim.bitmap[251]`. The overflow is small and DoS is the likely impact; code execution is potential, but still up in the air. The affected structure is stack-allocated in `handle_beacon()` and related handlers. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25063 | gradle-completion has a Bash command injection issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25063</link><description>gradle-completion provides Bash and Zsh completion support for Gradle. A command injection vulnerability was found in gradle-completion up to and including 9.3.0 that allows arbitrary code execution when a user triggers Bash tab completion in a project containing a malicious Gradle build file. The `gradle-completion` script for Bash fails to adequately sanitize Gradle task names and task descriptions, allowing command injection via a malicious Gradle build file when the user completes a command in Bash (without them explicitly running any task in the build). For example, given a task description that includes a string between backticks, then that string would be evaluated as a command when presenting the task description in the completion list. While task execution is the core feature of Gradle, this inherent execution may lead to unexpected outcomes. The vulnerability does not affect zsh completion. The first patched version is 9.3.1. As a workaround, it is possible and effective to temporarily disable bash completion for Gradle by removing `gradle-completion` from `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24902 | TrustTunnel has SSRF and private network restriction bypass via numeric address destinations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24902</link><description>TrustTunnel is an open-source VPN protocol with a server-side request forgery and and private network restriction bypass in versions prior to 0.9.114. In `tcp_forwarder.rs`, SSRF protection for `allow_private_network_connections = false` was only applied in the `TcpDestination::HostName(peer)` path. The `TcpDestination::Address(peer) =&gt; peer` path proceeded to `TcpStream::connect()` without equivalent checks (for example `is_global_ip`, `is_loopback`), allowing loopback/private targets to be reached by supplying a numeric IP. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.114.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:46:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24904 | TrustTunnel has `client_random_prefix` rule bypass via fragmented or partial TLS ClientHello</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24904</link><description>TrustTunnel is an open-source VPN protocol with a rule bypass issue in versions prior to 0.9.115. In `tls_listener.rs`, `TlsListener::listen()` peeks 1024 bytes and calls `extract_client_random(...)`. If `parse_tls_plaintext` fails (for example, a fragmented/partial ClientHello split across TCP writes), `extract_client_random` returns `None`. In `rules.rs`, `RulesEngine::evaluate` only evaluates `client_random_prefix` when `client_random` is `Some(...)`. As a result, when extraction fails (`client_random == None`), any rule that relies on `client_random_prefix` matching is skipped and evaluation falls through to later rules. As an important semantics note: `client_random_prefix` is a match condition only. It does not mean "block non-matching prefixes" by itself. A rule with `client_random_prefix = ...` triggers its `action` only when the prefix matches (and the field is available to evaluate). Non-matches (or `None`) simply do not match that rule and continue to fall through. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.115.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:46:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24845 | malcontent&amp;#x27;s OCI image scanning could expose registry credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24845</link><description>malcontent discovers supply-chain compromises through. context, differential analysis, and YARA.

However, the user still cannot access resources beyond what is accessible to the owner of the access key. Versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10 fix the vulnerability. Some other mitigations are available. Users can limit exposure by reviewing access keys which are scoped and ensuring any users with access to them have appropriate permissions set.

Please note that upgrading to a fixed version of Icinga for Windows will also automatically fix a similar issue present in Icinga 2, CVE-2026-24413. As a workaround, the permissions can be restricted manually by updating the ACL for the given folder `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\modules\icinga-powershell-framework\certificate` (and `C:\ProgramData\icinga2\var` to fix the issue for the Icinga 2 agent as well) including every sub-folder and item to restrict access for general users, only allowing the Icinga service user and administrators access.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:05:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24780 | AutoGPT is Vulnerable to RCE via Disabled Block Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24780</link><description>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.44, AutoGPT Platform's block execution endpoints (both main web API and external API) allow executing blocks by UUID without checking the `disabled` flag. Any authenticated user can execute the disabled `BlockInstallationBlock`, which writes arbitrary Python code to the server filesystem and executes it via `__import__()`, achieving Remote Code Execution. In default self-hosted deployments where Supabase signup is enabled, an attacker can self-register; if signup is disabled (e.g., hosted), the attacker needs an existing account. autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.44 contains a fix.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:05:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15545 | Insufficient Backup File Upload Input Validation on TP-Link Archer RE605X</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15545</link><description>The backup restore function does not properly validate unexpected or unrecognized tags within the backup file.

In versions prior to 3.26.0, when a container image is malformed or contains no layers, containerd falls back to bind-mounting an empty snapshotter directory for the container rootfs. When the Kata runtime attempts to mount the container rootfs, the bind mount causes the rootfs to be detected as a block device, leading to the underlying device being hotplugged to the guest. This can cause filesystem-level errors on the host due to double inode allocation, and may lead to the host's block device being mounted as read-only. Version 3.26.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:37:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24413 | Icinga has insecure permission of %ProgramData%\icinga2\var on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24413</link><description>Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. Starting in version 2.3.0 and prior to versions 2.13.14, 2.14.8, and 2.15.2, the Icinga 2 MSI did not set appropriate permissions for the `%ProgramData%\icinga2\var` folder on Windows. This resulted in the its contents - including the private key of the user and synced configuration - being readable by all local users. All installations on Windows are affected. Versions 2.13.14, 2.14.8, and 2.15.2 contains a fix. There are two possibilities to work around the issue without upgrading Icinga 2. Upgrade Icinga for Windows to at least version v1.13.4, v1.12.4, or v1.11.2. These version will automatically fix the ACLs for the Icinga 2 agent as well. Alternatively, manually update the ACL for the given folder `C:\ProgramData\icinga2\var` (and `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\modules\icinga-powershell-framework\certificate` to fix the issue for the Icinga for Windows as well) including every sub-folder and item to restrict access for general users, only allowing the Icinga service user and administrators access.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:37:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45160 | A HTML injection vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality of Cacti &lt;= 1.2.29.

In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend).
