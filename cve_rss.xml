In versions prior to 16.0.0, if the "claims_parameter_supported" parameter is activated, it is possible, thanks to the "oidc-claims-extension.groovy" script, to inject the value of one's choice into a claim contained in the id_token or in the user_info. In the request of an authorize function, a claims parameter containing a JSON file can be injected. This JSON file allows attackers to customize the claims returned by the "id_token" and "user_info" files. This allows for a very wide range of vulnerabilities depending on how clients use claims. For example, if some clients rely on an email field to identify a user, an attacker can choose the email address they want, and therefore assume any identity they choose. Version 16.0.0 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 19:15:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61667 | Datadog Linux Host Agent affected by local privilege escalation due to insufficient pycache permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61667</link><description>The Datadog Agent collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog. A vulnerability within the Datadog Linux Host Agent versions 7.65.0 through 7.70.2 exists due to insufficient permissions being set on the `opt/datadog-agent/python-scripts/__pycache__` directory during installation. Code in this directory is only run by the Agent during Agent install/upgrades.  This could allow an attacker with local access to modify files in this directory, which would then subsequently be run when the Agent is upgraded, resulting in local privilege escalation. This issue requires local access to the host and a valid low privilege account to be vulnerable. Note that this vulnerability only impacts the Linux Host Agent. Other variations of the Agent including the container, kubernetes, windows host and other agents are not impacted. Version 7.71.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:56:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63929 | A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in airpig2011 IEC104 thru Commit be6d841 (2019-07-08).

In CUPS-Filters versions up to and including 1.28.17 and libscupsfilters versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.1, CUPS-Filters's `imagetoraster` filter has an out of bounds read/write vulnerability in the processing of TIFF image files.  While the pixel buffer is allocated with the number of pixels times a pre-calculated bytes-per-pixel value, the function which processes these pixels is called with a size of the number of pixels times 3.  When suitable inputs are passed, the bytes-per-pixel value can be set to 1 and bytes outside of the buffer bounds get processed. In order to trigger the bug, an attacker must issue a print job with a crafted TIFF file, and pass appropriate print job options to control the bytes-per-pixel value of the output format. They must choose a printer configuration under which the `imagetoraster` filter or its C-function equivalent `cfFilterImageToRaster()` gets invoked. The vulnerability exists in both CUPS-Filters 1.x and the successor library libcupsfilters (CUPS-Filters 2.x). In CUPS-Filters 2.x, the vulnerable function is `_cfImageReadTIFF() in libcupsfilters`. When this function is invoked as part of `cfFilterImageToRaster()`, the caller passes a look-up-table during whose processing the out of bounds memory access happens. In CUPS-Filters 1.x, the equivalent functions are all found in the cups-filters repository, which is not split into subprojects yet, and the vulnerable code is in `_cupsImageReadTIFF()`, which is called through `cupsImageOpen()` from the `imagetoraster` tool. A patch is available in commit b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:56:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63927 | A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in airpig2011 IEC104 thru Commit be6d841 (2019-07-08).

While receiving the KDC's response, kdcproxy copies the entire buffered stream into a new
buffer on each recv() call, even when the transfer is incomplete, causing excessive memory allocation and CPU usage. Additionally, kdcproxy accepts incoming response chunks as long as the received data length is not exactly equal to the length indicated in the response
header, even when individual chunks or the total buffer exceed the maximum length of a Kerberos message. This allows an attacker to send unbounded data until the connection timeout is reached (approximately 12 seconds), exhausting server memory or CPU resources. Multiple concurrent requests can cause accept queue overflow, denying service to legitimate clients.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:01:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2843 | Observability-operator: observability operator privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2843</link><description>A flaw was found in the Observability Operator.

This creates a server-side request forgery vulnerability, since an attacker could send a request for a realm matching a DNS zone where they created SRV records pointing to arbitrary ports and hostnames (which may resolve to loopback or internal IP addresses). This vulnerability can be exploited to probe internal network topology and firewall rules, perform port scanning, and exfiltrate data. Deployments where

SKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.
However, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is

Add a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB

bpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops

When verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates
instructions with ALU operations. The 'offset' field in these
instructions is a signed 16-bit integer.

The existing check 'insn-&gt;off &gt; 1' was intended to ensure the offset is
either 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV. However, because 'insn-&gt;off' is
signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1).

This commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to
'(insn-&gt;off != 0 &amp;&amp; insn-&gt;off != 1)'. This ensures that any value
other than the explicitly permitted 0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the
verifier against malformed BPF programs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:57:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40170 | net: use dst_dev_rcu() in sk_setup_caps()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40170</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc: Check GuC running state before deregistering exec queue

In normal operation, a registered exec queue is disabled and
deregistered through the GuC, and freed only after the GuC confirms
completion. However, if the driver is forced to unbind while the exec
queue is still running, the user may call exec_destroy() after the GuC
has already been stopped and CT communication disabled.

In this case, the driver cannot receive a response from the GuC,
preventing proper cleanup of exec queue resources. Fix this by directly
releasing the resources when GuC is not running.

Here is the failure dmesg log:

ext4: detect invalid INLINE_DATA + EXTENTS flag combination

syzbot reported a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() when opening a verity
file on a corrupted ext4 filesystem mounted without a journal.

The issue is that the filesystem has an inode with both the INLINE_DATA
and EXTENTS flags set:

    EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_cache_extents:545: inode #15:
    comm syz.0.17: corrupted extent tree: lblk 0 &lt; prev 66

Investigation revealed that the inode has both flags set:
    DEBUG: inode 15 - flag=1, i_inline_off=164, has_inline=1, extents_flag=1

This is an invalid combination since an inode should have either:
- INLINE_DATA: data stored directly in the inode
- EXTENTS: data stored in extent-mapped blocks

Having both flags causes ext4_has_inline_data() to return true, skipping
extent tree validation in __ext4_iget(). The unvalidated out-of-order
extents then trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() due to integer
underflow when calculating hole sizes.

Fix this by detecting this invalid flag combination early in ext4_iget()
and rejecting the corrupted inode.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:48:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40112 | sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for Niagara</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40112</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: qcom: pas: Shutdown lite ADSP DTB on X1E

The ADSP firmware on X1E has separate firmware binaries for the main
firmware and the DTB. The same applies for the "lite" firmware loaded by
the boot firmware.

When preparing to load the new ADSP firmware we shutdown the lite_pas_id
for the main firmware, but we don't shutdown the corresponding lite pas_id
for the DTB. The fact that we're leaving it "running" forever becomes
obvious if you try to reuse (or just access) the memory region used by the
"lite" firmware: The &amp;amp;adsp_boot_mem is accessible, but accessing the
&amp;amp;adsp_boot_dtb_mem results in a crash.

We don't support reusing the memory regions currently, but nevertheless we
should not keep part of the lite firmware running. Fix this by adding the
lite_dtb_pas_id and shutting it down as well.

We don't have a way to detect if the lite firmware is actually running yet,
so ignore the return status of qcom_scm_pas_shutdown() for now. This was
already the case before, the assignment to "ret" is not used anywhere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40115 | scsi: mpt3sas: Fix crash in transport port remove by using ioc_info()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod

Since commit f7b705c238d1 ("scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached to zero when
device is gone") UBSAN reports:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17
  index 28 is out of range for type 'pm8001_phy [16]'

on rmmod when using an expander.

For a direct attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id.
For a device behind an expander, attached_phy contains the remote phy
id, not the local phy id.

I.e. while pm8001_ha will have pm8001_ha-&gt;chip-&gt;n_phy local phys, for a
device behind an expander, attached_phy can be much larger than
pm8001_ha-&gt;chip-&gt;n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the
expander).

E.g. on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the
ports has an expander connected.  The expander has 31 phys with phy ids
0-30.

The pm8001_ha-&gt;phy array only contains the phys of the HBA.  It does not
contain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy
to index the pm8001_ha-&gt;phy array for a device behind an expander.

Thus, we can only clear phy_attached for devices that are directly
attached.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40119 | ext4: fix potential null deref in ext4_mb_init()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40119</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix: hold PM usage ref to avoid PM/MDIO + RTNL deadlock

Prevent USB runtime PM (autosuspend) for AX88772* in bind.

usbnet enables runtime PM (autosuspend) by default, so disabling it via
the usb_driver flag is ineffective. On AX88772B, autosuspend shows no
measurable power saving with current driver (no link partner, admin
up/down). The ~0.453 W -&gt; ~0.248 W drop on v6.1 comes from phylib powering
the PHY off on admin-down, not from USB autosuspend.

The real hazard is that with runtime PM enabled, ndo_open() (under RTNL)
may synchronously trigger autoresume (usb_autopm_get_interface()) into
asix_resume() while the USB PM lock is held. Resume paths then invoke
phylink/phylib and MDIO, which also expect RTNL, leading to possible
deadlocks or PM lock vs MDIO wake issues.

To avoid this, keep the device runtime-PM active by taking a usage
reference in ax88772_bind() and dropping it in unbind(). A non-zero PM
usage count blocks runtime suspend regardless of userspace policy
(.../power/control - pm_runtime_allow/forbid), making this approach
robust against sysfs overrides.

Holding a runtime-PM usage ref does not affect system-wide suspend;
system sleep/resume callbacks continue to run as before.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40121 | ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix invalid quirk input mapping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40121</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

On PTL, GP counter 0 and 1 doesn't support auto counter reload feature,
thus it would trigger a #GP when trying to write 1 on bit 0 of CFG_B MSR
which requires to enable auto counter reload on GP counter 0.

The root cause of causing this issue is the check for auto counter
reload (ACR) counter mask from user space is incorrect in
intel_pmu_acr_late_setup() helper. It leads to an invalid ACR counter
mask from user space could be set into hw.config1 and then written into
CFG_B MSRs and trigger the MSR access warning.

e.g., User may create a perf event with ACR counter mask (config2=0xcb),
and there is only 1 event created, so "cpuc-&gt;n_events" is 1.

The correct check condition should be "i + idx &gt;= cpuc-&gt;n_events"
instead of "i + idx &gt; cpuc-&gt;n_events" (it looks a typo). Otherwise,
the counter mask would traverse twice and an invalid "cpuc-&gt;assign[1]"
bit (bit 0) is set into hw.config1 and cause MSR accessing error.

Besides, also check if the ACR counter mask corresponding events are
ACR events. If not, filter out these counter mask. If a event is not a
ACR event, it could be scheduled to an HW counter which doesn't support
ACR. It's invalid to add their counter index in ACR counter mask.

Furthermore, remove the WARN_ON_ONCE() since it's easily triggered as
user could set any invalid ACR counter mask and the warning message
could mislead users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40123 | bpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40123</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility

Yinhao et al. recently reported:

  Our fuzzer tool discovered an uninitialized pointer issue in the
  bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() function within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.
  This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when a BPF program attempts to
  deference the txq member of struct xdp_buff object.

The test initializes two programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP: progA acts as the
entry point for bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() and its expected_attach_type can
neither be of be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP nor BPF_XDP_CPUMAP. progA calls into a slot
of a tailcall map it owns. progB's expected_attach_type must be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP
to pass xdp_is_valid_access() validation. The program returns struct xdp_md's
egress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned
expected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA
calls.

The underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs
of type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well
as sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'
expected_attach_type. Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME
should not be allowed doing a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind()
out of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.

In short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional
functionality or restrictions beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables.
The use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints. Fix it by enforcing
expected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().

Note that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or
cpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and
cpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment / context and therefore
these situations are not prone to this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40124 | sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40124</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III

Anthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios
enabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values
greater than the size to be copied. This lead to __copy_from_iter()
returning impossible values instead of the actual number of bytes it was
able to copy.

The BUG_ON has been reported in
https://lore.kernel.org/r/b14f55642207e63e907965e209f6323a0df6dcee.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de

The referenced commit introduced exception handlers on user-space memory
references in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These handlers return from
the respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy
using the current register contents. The exception handlers expect that
%o2 has already been masked during the bulk copy loop, but the masking was
performed after that loop. This will fix the return value of copy_from_user
and copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays
unchanged.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40125 | blk-mq: check kobject state_in_sysfs before deleting in blk_mq_unregister_hctx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40125</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Please note bs &gt; ps support is still under development and the
enablement patch is not even in btrfs development branch.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs reuses its data folio read path to handle symbolic links, as the
symbolic link target is stored as an inline data extent.

But for newly created inodes, btrfs only set the minimal order if the
target inode is a regular file.

Thus for above newly created symbolic link, it doesn't properly respect
the minimal folio order, and triggered the above crash.

[FIX]
Call btrfs_set_inode_mapping_order() unconditionally inside
btrfs_create_new_inode().

For symbolic links this will fix the crash as now the folio will meet
the minimal order.

For regular files this brings no change.

For directory/bdev/char and all the other types of inodes, they won't
go through the data read path, thus no effect either.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40129 | sunrpc: fix null pointer dereference on zero-length checksum</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40129</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix data race in CPU latency PM QoS request handling

The cpu_latency_qos_add/remove/update_request interfaces lack internal
synchronization by design, requiring the caller to ensure thread safety.
The current implementation relies on the 'pm_qos_enabled' flag, which is
insufficient to prevent concurrent access and cannot serve as a proper
synchronization mechanism. This has led to data races and list
corruption issues.

A typical race condition call trace is:

wifi: ath12k: Fix peer lookup in ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu()

In ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu(), peer lookup fails because
rxcb-&gt;peer_id is not updated with a valid value. This is expected
in monitor mode, where RX frames bypass the regular RX
descriptor path that typically sets rxcb-&gt;peer_id.
As a result, the peer is NULL, and link_id and link_valid fields
in the RX status are not populated. This leads to a WARN_ON in
mac80211 when it receives data frame from an associated station
with invalid link_id.

Fix this potential issue by using ppduinfo-&gt;peer_id, which holds
the correct peer id for the received frame. This ensures that the
peer is correctly found and the associated link metadata is updated
accordingly.

Fix this by checking if a valid table (map) exists before performing
request-based suspend and waiting for target I/O. When map is NULL,
skip these table-dependent suspend steps.

Even when map is NULL, no I/O can reach any target because there is
no table loaded; I/O submitted in this state will fail early in the
DM layer. Skipping the table-dependent suspend logic in this case
is safe and avoids NULL pointer dereferences.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40135 | ipv6: use RCU in ip6_xmit()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40135</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Disable bottom softirqs as part of spin_lock_irq() on PREEMPT_RT

snd_pcm_group_lock_irq() acquires a spinlock_t and disables interrupts
via spin_lock_irq(). This also implicitly disables the handling of
softirqs such as TIMER_SOFTIRQ.
On PREEMPT_RT softirqs are preemptible and spin_lock_irq() does not
disable them. That means a timer can be invoked during spin_lock_irq()
on the same CPU. Due to synchronisations reasons local_bh_disable() has
a per-CPU lock named softirq_ctrl.lock which synchronizes individual
softirq against each other.
syz-bot managed to trigger a lockdep report where softirq_ctrl.lock is
acquired in hrtimer_cancel() in addition to hrtimer_run_softirq(). This
is a possible deadlock.

The softirq_ctrl.lock can not be made part of spin_lock_irq() as this
would lead to too much synchronisation against individual threads on the
system. To avoid the possible deadlock, softirqs must be manually
disabled before the lock is acquired.

Disable softirqs before the lock is acquired on PREEMPT_RT.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40143 | bpf: dont report verifier bug for missing bpf_scc_visit on speculative path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: dont report verifier bug for missing bpf_scc_visit on speculative path

Syzbot generated a program that triggers a verifier_bug() call in
maybe_exit_scc(). maybe_exit_scc() assumes that, when called for a
state with insn_idx in some SCC, there should be an instance of struct
bpf_scc_visit allocated for that SCC. Turns out the assumption does
not hold for speculative execution paths. See example in the next
patch.

maybe_scc_exit() is called from update_branch_counts() for states that
reach branch count of zero, meaning that path exploration for a
particular path is finished. Path exploration can finish in one of
three ways:
a. Verification error is found. In this case, update_branch_counts()
   is called only for non-speculative paths.
b. Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of
   an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return
   false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early.
c. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by
   is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates
   bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.

Hence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption
still holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC,
bpf_scc_visit instance must exist.

This patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40144 | nvdimm: ndtest: Return -ENOMEM if devm_kcalloc() fails in ndtest_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40144</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-throttle: fix access race during throttle policy activation

On repeated cold boots we occasionally hit a NULL pointer crash in
blk_should_throtl() when throttling is consulted before the throttle
policy is fully enabled for the queue. Checking only q-&gt;td != NULL is
insufficient during early initialization, so blkg_to_pd() for the
throttle policy can still return NULL and blkg_to_tg() becomes NULL,
which later gets dereferenced.

Tighten blk_throtl_activated() to also require that the throttle policy
bit is set on the queue:

  return q-&gt;td != NULL &amp;&amp;
         test_bit(blkcg_policy_throtl.plid, q-&gt;blkcg_pols);

This prevents blk_should_throtl() from accessing throttle group state
until policy data has been attached to blkgs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40148 | drm/amd/display: Add NULL pointer checks in dc_stream cursor attribute functions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add NULL pointer checks in dc_stream cursor attribute functions

The function dc_stream_set_cursor_attributes() currently dereferences
the `stream` pointer and nested members `stream-&gt;ctx-&gt;dc-&gt;current_state`
without checking for NULL.

All callers of these functions, such as in
`dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations()` and
`amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update()`, already perform NULL checks
before calling these functions.

Fixes below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_stream.c:336 dc_stream_program_cursor_attributes()
error: we previously assumed 'stream' could be null (see line 334)

This function used to check for if stream as NULL and return false at

tls: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().

get_netdev_for_sock() is called during setsockopt(),

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().

f2fs: fix to avoid migrating empty section

It reports a bug from device w/ zufs:

F2FS-fs (dm-64): Inconsistent segment (173822) type [1, 0] in SSA and SIT
F2FS-fs (dm-64): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 4

Thread A				Thread B
- f2fs_expand_inode_data
 - f2fs_allocate_pinning_section
  - f2fs_gc_range
   - do_garbage_collect w/ segno #x
					- writepage
					 - f2fs_allocate_data_block
					  - new_curseg
					   - allocate segno #x

The root cause is: fallocate on pinning file may race w/ block allocation
as above, result in do_garbage_collect() from fallocate() may migrate
segment which is just allocated by a log, the log will update segment type
in its in-memory structure, however GC will get segment type from on-disk
SSA block, once segment type changes by log, we can detect such
inconsistency, then shutdown filesystem.

In this case, on-disk SSA shows type of segno #173822 is 1 (SUM_TYPE_NODE),
however segno #173822 was just allocated as data type segment, so in-memory
SIT shows type of segno #173822 is 0 (SUM_TYPE_DATA).

Change as below to fix this issue:
- check whether current section is empty before gc
- add sanity checks on do_garbage_collect() to avoid any race case, result
in migrating segment used by log.
- btw, it fixes misc issue in printed logs: "SSA and SIT" -&gt; "SIT and SSA".</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40151 | LoongArch: BPF: No support of struct argument in trampoline programs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40151</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Soft lockup is not triggered with THP or base page because there is
cond_resched() called for each PMD size.

Although the soft lockup was triggered by MTE, it should be not MTE
specific.  The other processing which takes long time in the loop may
trigger soft lockup too.

So add cond_resched() for hugetlb to avoid soft lockup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40154 | ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix invalid quirk input mapping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40154</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/i10nm: Skip DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory controller

When loading the i10nm_edac driver on some Intel Granite Rapids servers,
a call trace may appear as follows:

xsk: Harden userspace-supplied xdp_desc validation

Turned out certain clearly invalid values passed in xdp_desc from
userspace can pass xp_{,un}aligned_validate_desc() and then lead
to UBs or just invalid frames to be queued for xmit.

desc-&gt;len close to ``U32_MAX`` with a non-zero pool-&gt;tx_metadata_len
can cause positive integer overflow and wraparound, the same way low
enough desc-&gt;addr with a non-zero pool-&gt;tx_metadata_len can cause
negative integer overflow. Both scenarios can then pass the
validation successfully.
This doesn't happen with valid XSk applications, but can be used
to perform attacks.

Always promote desc-&gt;len to ``u64`` first to exclude positive
overflows of it. Use explicit check_{add,sub}_overflow() when
validating desc-&gt;addr (which is ``u64`` already).

xen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs

Change find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a
different CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON()
from bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate the error upwards.

Some VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must
be bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for
per-domain and global will probably fail when migrated off CPU 0,
especially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now returns -EEXIST
instead of BUG_ON().

A second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is not expected, but
make it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don't
know which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:28:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40161 | mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix SGI cleanup on unbind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40161</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Git bisects to: commit 4ae8d9aa9f9d ("sched/deadline: Fix dl_server getting stuck")

This happens since:
- dl_server hrtimer gets enqueued close to cpu offline, when
  kthread_park enqueues a fair task.
- CPU goes offline and drmgr removes it from cpu_present_mask.
- hrtimer fires and warning is hit.

Fix it by stopping the dl_server before CPU is marked dead.

Address this issue by moving the streaming preparation and cleanup to

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper

Check that the resource which is converted to a surface exists before
trying to use the cursor snooper on it.

vmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers
because some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean "no surface",
unfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might
(and in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null
objects. Make sure that we validate not only the identifier (via the
vmw_cmd_res_check) but also check that the actual resource exists before
trying to do something with it.

Fixes unchecked null-ptr reference in the snooping code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 02:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40111 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix Use-after-free in validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40111</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5 to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component, gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster. This grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations such as database or collection management. This issue has been fixed in Milvus 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5. If immediate upgrade is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach the Milvus Proxy. This prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64518 | CycloneDX Core (Java): BOM validation is vulnerable to XML External Entity injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64518</link><description>The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 11.0.1, the XML `Validator` used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8 / CVE-2024-38374 was incomplete in that it only fixed parsing of XML BOMs, but not validation. The vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1.

An issue in versions prior to 6.0.6 and 6.19.0 affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user. The most common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can be executed as an unprivileged user on the host to gain root privileges. A patch for this issue is expected in versions 6.0.6 and 6.19.0. As a workaround, permissions can be manually restricted until a patched version of Incus is deployed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:25:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64512 | pdfminer.six vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Crafted PDF Input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64512</link><description>Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed.

Starting in version 2.70.0 and prior to versions 2.95.11 and 3.124.1, in certain project membership APIs, the server trusted a user‑controlled orgId and used it in authorization checks. As a result, any authenticated user on the same Langfuse instance could enumerate names and email addresses of users in another organization if they knew the target organization’s ID. Disclosure is limited to names and email addresses of members/invitees. No customer data such as traces, prompts, or evaluations is exposed or accessible. For Langfuse Cloud, the maintainers ran a thorough investigation of access logs of the last 30 days and could not find any evidence that this vulnerability was exploited. For most self-hosting deployments, the attack surface is significantly reduced given an SSO provider is configured and email/password sign-up is disabled. In these cases, only users who authenticate via the Enterprise SSO IdP (e.g. Okta) would be able to exploit this vulnerability to access the member list, i.e. internal users getting access to a list of other internal users. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the actor must have a valid Langfuse user account within the same instance, know the target orgId, and use the request made to the API that powers the frontend membership tables, including their project/user authentication token, while changing the orgId to the target organization. Langfuse Cloud (EU, US, HIPAA) were affected until fix deployment on November 1, 2025. The maintainers reviewed the Langfuse Cloud access logs from the past 30 days and found no evidence that this vulnerability was exploited. Self-Hosted versions which contain patches include v2.95.11 for major version 2 and v3.124.1 for major version 3. There are no known workarounds. Upgrading is required to fully mitigate this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:59:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64508 | Bugsink vulnerable to unauthenticated remote DoS via crafted Brotli input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64508</link><description>Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool.

The MongoDB `explain()` method provides detailed information about query execution plans, including index usage, collection scanning behavior, and performance metrics. Prior to version 8.5.0-alpha.5, Parse Server permits any client to execute explain queries without requiring the master key. This exposes database schema structure and field names, index configurations and query optimization details, query execution statistics and performance metrics, and potential attack vectors for database performance exploitation. In version 8.5.0-alpha.5, a new `databaseOptions.allowPublicExplain` configuration option has been introduced that allows to restrict `explain` queries to the master key. The option defaults to `true` for now to avoid a breaking change in production systems that depends on public `explain` availability. In addition, a security warning is logged when the option is not explicitly set, or set to `true`. In a future major release of Parse Server, the default will change to `false`. As a workaround, implement middleware to block explain queries from non-master-key requests, or monitor and alert on explain query usage in production environments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:51:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64182 | OpenEXR has buffer overflow in PyOpenEXR_old&amp;#x27;s channels() and channel()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64182</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry.

In versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4, 3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2, there is a use-after-free in PyObject_StealAttrString of pyOpenEXR_old.cpp. The legacy adapter defines PyObject_StealAttrString that calls PyObject_GetAttrString to obtain a new reference, immediately decrefs it, and returns the pointer. Callers then pass this dangling pointer to APIs like PyLong_AsLong/PyFloat_AsDouble, resulting in a use-after-free. This is invoked in multiple places (e.g., reading PixelType.v, Box2i, V2f, etc.) Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:42:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64484 | OAuth2-Proxy vulnerable to header smuggling via underscore, leading to potential privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64484</link><description>OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0, all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic, potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized, meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example, both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it, the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround, ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:42:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62780 | changedetection.io vulnerable to stored XSS in Watch update via API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62780</link><description>changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. A Stored Cross Site Scripting is present in changedetection.io Watch update API in versions prior to 0.50.34 due to insufficient security checks. Two scenarios are possible. In the first, an attacker can insert a new watch with an arbitrary URL which really points to a web page. Once the HTML content is retrieved, the attacker updates the URL with a JavaScript payload. In the second, an attacker substitutes the URL in an existing watch with a new URL that is in reality a JavaScript payload. When the user clicks on *Preview* and then on the malicious link, the JavaScript malicious code is executed. Version 0.50.34 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:29:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64181 | OpenEXR Makes Use of Uninitialized Memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64181</link><description>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry.
