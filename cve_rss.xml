Prior to versions OTP-27.3.1, 26.2.5.10, and 25.3.2.19, a maliciously formed KEX init message can result with high memory usage. Implementation does not verify RFC specified limits on algorithm names (64 characters) provided in KEX init message. Big KEX init packet may lead to inefficient processing of the error data. As a result, large amount of memory will be allocated for processing malicious data. Versions OTP-27.3.1, OTP-26.2.5.10, and OTP-25.3.2.19 fix the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may set option `parallel_login` to `false` and/or reduce the `max_sessions` option.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:59:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30372 | Emlog Pro contains an SQL injection vulnerability.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30372</link><description>Emlog is an open source website building system.

This is fixed in v0.52.16.4, v1.52.16.4, v0.53.8, and v1.53.8. Migrating to Metabase Cloud or redeploying Metabase in a dedicated subnet with strict outbound port controls is an available workaround.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:52:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39311 | Publify Vulnerable To Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Via Redirects Requiring User Interaction</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39311</link><description>Publify is a self hosted Web publishing platform on Rails. Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29928 | authentik&amp;#x27;s deletion of sessions did not revoke sessions when using database session storage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29928</link><description>authentik is an open-source identity provider. Prior to versions 2024.12.4 and 2025.2.3, when authentik was configured to use the database for session storage (which is a non-default setting), deleting sessions via the Web Interface or the API would not revoke the session and the session holder would continue to have access to authentik. authentik 2025.2.3 and 2024.12.4 fix this issue. Switching to the cache-based session storage until the authentik instance can be upgraded is recommended. This will however also delete all existing sessions and users will have to re-authenticate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:52:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48615 | Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability in libarchive 3.7.6 and earlier when running program bsdtar in function header_pax_extension at rchiv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48615</link><description>Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability in libarchive 3.7.6 and earlier when running program bsdtar in function header_pax_extension at rchive_read_support_format_tar.c:1844:8.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:33:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2877 | Event-driven-ansible: exposure inventory passwords in plain text when starting a rulebook activation with verbosity set to debug in eda</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2877</link><description>A flaw was found in the Ansible Automation Platform's Event-Driven Ansible.

No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file upload action.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 05:31:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31335 | The OpenSAML C++ library before 3.3.1 allows forging of signed SAML messages via parameter manipulation (when using SAML bindings that rely ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31335</link><description>The OpenSAML C++ library before 3.3.1 allows forging of signed SAML messages via parameter manipulation (when using SAML bindings that rely on non-XML signatures).</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 05:31:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2294 | Kubio AI Page Builder &amp;lt;= 2.5.1 - Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2294</link><description>The Kubio AI Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 via thekubio_hybrid_theme_load_template function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other âsafeâ file types can be uploaded and included.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 04:35:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2894 | Unitree Go1 Robot Dog Backdoor Control Channel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2894</link><description>The Go1Â also known as "The World's First Intelligence Bionic Quadruped Robot Companion of Consumer Level," contains an undocumented backdoor that can enable the manufacturer, and anyone in possession of the correct API key, complete remote control over the affected robotic device using the CloudSail remote access service.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 03:24:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24381 | Dell Unity, version(s) 5.4 and prior, contain(s) an URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability.

An unauthenticated attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a targeted application user being redirected to arbitrary web URLs. The vulnerability could be leveraged by attackers to conduct phishing attacks that cause users to divulge sensitive information. Exploitation may allow for session theft.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 02:51:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13939 | String::Compare::ConstantTime for Perl through 0.321 is vulnerable to timing attacks that allow an attacker to guess the length of a secret string</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13939</link><description>String::Compare::ConstantTime for Perl through 0.321 is vulnerable to timing attacks that allow an attacker to guess the length of a secret string.

As stated in the documentation: "If the lengths of the strings are different, because equals returns false right away the size of the secret string may be leaked (but not its contents)."
