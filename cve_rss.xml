HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0119 | Cortex XDR Broker VM: Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability in Broker VM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0119</link><description>A command injection vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR® Broker VM allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the host operating system running Broker VM.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:43:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32367 | The Oz Forensics face recognition application before 4.0.8 late 2023 allows PII retrieval via /statistic/list Insecure Direct Object Referen...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32367</link><description>The Oz Forensics face recognition application before 4.0.8 late 2023 allows PII retrieval via /statistic/list Insecure Direct Object Reference.

Prior to version 2.1.44, it is possible to inject malicious code into the HTML content of an email notification, which is then rendered on the preview. There is no issue when rendering the email via normal means (a delivered email). This would require access to the form's email notification settings. This has been fixed in Formie 2.1.44.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:47:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32427 | Formie has a XSS vulnerability for importing forms</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32427</link><description>Formie is a Craft CMS plugin for creating forms. Prior to 2.1.44, when importing a form from JSON, if the field label or handle contained malicious content, the output wasn't correctly escaped when viewing a preview of what was to be imported. As imports are undertaking primarily by users who have themselves exported the form from one environment to another, and would require direct manipulation of the JSON export, this is marked as moderate. This vulnerability will not occur unless someone deliberately tampers with the export. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.44.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:47:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13861 | A code injection vulnerability in the Debian package component of Taegis Endpoint Agent (Linux) versions older than 1.3.10 allows local user...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13861</link><description>A code injection vulnerability in the Debian package component of Taegis Endpoint Agent (Linux) versions older than 1.3.10 allows local users arbitrary code execution as root.

Your application may be affected by this if the following are true:
  *  You have Spring Vault on the classpath of your Spring Cloud Config Server and
  *  You are using the X-CONFIG-TOKEN header to send a Vault token to the Spring Cloud Config Server for the Config Server to use when making requests to Vault and
  *  You are using the default Spring Vault SessionManager implementation LifecycleAwareSessionManager or a SessionManager implementation that persists the Vault token such as SimpleSessionManager.

In this case the SessionManager persists the first token it retrieves and will continue to use that token even if client requests to the Spring Cloud Config Server include a X-CONFIG-TOKEN header with a different value.
Affected Spring Products and Versions
Spring Cloud Config:
  *  2.2.1.RELEASE - 4.2.1

Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected.
