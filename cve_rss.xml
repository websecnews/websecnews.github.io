This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 20:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7319 | Openstack-heat: incomplete fix for cve-2023-1625</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7319</link><description>An incomplete fix for CVE-2023-1625 was found in openstack-heat.

versions prior to 5.0.589 contain a misconfiguration in the Node.js environment
settings that could allow code execution by utilizing the 'ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE' environment variable.
Any malicious application operating with standard user permissions can exploit
this vulnerability, enabling code execution within WD Discovery application's
context. WD Discovery version 5.0.589 addresses this issue by disabling certain
features and fuses in Electron. The attack vector for this issue requires the victim to have the WD Discovery app installed on their device.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 18:42:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28297 | SQL injection vulnerability in AzureSoft MyHorus 4.3.5 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28297</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in AzureSoft MyHorus 4.3.5 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 18:42:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28298 | SQL injection vulnerability in BM SOFT BMPlanning 1.0.0.1 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the SEC_IDF, LIE_...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28298</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in BM SOFT BMPlanning 1.0.0.1 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the SEC_IDF, LIE_IDF, PLANF_IDF, CLI_IDF, DOS_IDF, and possibly other parameters to /BMServerR.dll/BMRest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 18:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38886 | An issue in Horizon Business Services Inc.

Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a ThirdPartyBlock request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it, which includes the public key of the previous block (used in the signature) and the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 22:19:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7369 | SourceCodester Simple Realtime Quiz System Login ajax.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7369</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Simple Realtime Quiz System 1.0 and classified as critical.
