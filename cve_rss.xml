"Local sync" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git. An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass by removing `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28175 | Cross-site scripting on application summary component in argo-cd</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28175</link><description>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim's permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22167 | SanDisk PrivateAccess DLL Hijacking Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22167</link><description>A potential DLL hijacking vulnerability in the SanDisk PrivateAccess application for Windows that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system user.

YourSpotify version &lt; 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account, resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk

In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute
its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However, we
do not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,
which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another
folio/page/slab.

Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for
the folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.

This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their
dirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow
conventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get "cleaned" during
swapout, after which they're no longer resident etc.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:58:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28679 | DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via Photo Collection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28679</link><description>DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via Photo Collection.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:58:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28683 | DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via create file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28683</link><description>DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via create file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:58:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24549 | Apache Tomcat: HTTP/2 header handling DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24549</link><description>Denial of Service due to improper input validation vulnerability for HTTP/2 requests in Apache Tomcat.

firmware: arm_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency

On reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed
to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence
number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related
payload is fetched too.

When an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the
platform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence,
any further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel
to be relinquished by the platform.

Once that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back
to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and
overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait
for the reply to the new request starts.

It has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can
be wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens
the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the
message header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending
transaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive.

This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the
channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the
channel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ.

Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:10:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26629 | nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26629</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER

The test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and
harmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.

First: harmful.
As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
incorrect behaviour.

If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
incorrect error.

The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
some later locking request.

When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.

So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
so_count allows.

The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.

so_count is the sum of three different counts.
1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.

When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
clear what the other one is expected to be.

In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.

In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.

The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.

So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather

Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the "no commands" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the "no commands" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 20:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42308 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Manage Fastrack Subjects in Code-Projects Exam Form Submission 1.0 allows attackers to run arbit...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42308</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Manage Fastrack Subjects in Code-Projects Exam Form Submission 1.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the "Subject Name" and "Subject Code" Section.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 20:39:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23300 | A use-after-free issue was addressed with improved memory management.

In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\"target\":\"[class_name]#[method_name]\",\"args\":[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method.

A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&amp;thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator-&gt;authenticate()` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should adopt the following measures: 1. Avoid Storing Complete Stack Traces, 2. Implement redaction mechanisms to filter and exclude sensitive information, and 3. Review and enhance the application's logging practices.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 19:45:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2031 | The Video Conferencing with Zoom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'zoom_recordings_by_meet...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2031</link><description>The Video Conferencing with Zoom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'zoom_recordings_by_meeting' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.

The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed.

2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.
3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.
3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 18:26:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27135 | Apache Pulsar: Improper Input Validation in Pulsar Function Worker allows Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27135</link><description>Improper input validation in the Pulsar Function Worker allows a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary Java code on the Pulsar Function worker, outside of the sandboxes designated for running user-provided functions.

These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren't properly validated, contain special elements like "..", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior.

The supported URL schemes include "file", "http", and "https". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.
This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0.

The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: "additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns" and "additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 18:26:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28098 | Apache Pulsar: Improper Authorization For Topic-Level Policy Management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28098</link><description>The vulnerability allows authenticated users with only produce or consume permissions to modify topic-level policies, such as retention, TTL, and offloading settings.

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see  RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no workaround for affected versions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 18:11:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1765 | Unlimited resource allocation by QUIC CRYPTO frames flooding in quiche</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1765</link><description>Cloudflare Quiche (through version 0.19.1/0.20.0) was affected by an unlimited resource allocation vulnerability causing rapid increase of memory usage of the system running quiche server or client.
A remote attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by repeatedly sending an unlimited number of 1-RTT CRYPTO frames after previously completing the QUIC handshake.
Exploitation was possible for the duration of the connection which could be extended by the attacker. 
quiche 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest versions containing the fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 18:11:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1137 | TIBCO ActiveSpaces Information Leak Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1137</link><description>The Proxy and Client components of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO ActiveSpaces - Enterprise Edition contain a vulnerability that theoretically allows an Active Spaces client to passively observe data traffic to other clients.
