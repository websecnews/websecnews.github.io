In affected versions a global buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CrsfParser_TryParseCrsfPacket function in /src/drivers/rc/crsf_rc/CrsfParser.cpp:298 due to the invalid size check. A malicious user may create an RC packet remotely and that packet goes into the device where the _rcs_buf reads. The global buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered and the drone can behave unexpectedly. This issue has been addressed in version 1.14.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 20:55:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42813 | Denial of service from malicious manifest in kyverno</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42813</link><description>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A security vulnerability was found in Kyverno where an attacker could cause denial of service of Kyverno. The vulnerable component in Kyvernos Notary verifier. An attacker would need control over the registry from which Kyverno would fetch attestations. With such a position, the attacker could return a malicious response to Kyverno, when Kyverno would send a request to the registry. The malicious response would cause denial of service of Kyverno, such that other users' admission requests would be blocked from being processed. This is a vulnerability in a new component released in v1.11.0. The only users affected by this are those that have been building Kyverno from source at the main branch which is not encouraged. Users consuming official Kyverno releases are not affected. There are no known cases of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 20:45:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42814 | Denial of service from malicious image manifest in kyverno</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42814</link><description>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.

In all current versions of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 20:22:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47621 | Remote code execution via file uploads in guest-entries </title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47621</link><description>Guest Entries is a php library which allows users to create, update &amp; delete entries from the front-end of a site. In affected versions the file uploads feature did not prevent the upload of PHP files. This may lead to code execution on the server by authenticated users. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 20:22:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6102 | Maiwei Safety Production Control Platform unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6102</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Maiwei Safety Production Control Platform 4.1.
