The flaw is triggered when the service receives a specially crafted packet using opcode 0x57 with an overly long payload. Due to improper bounds checking during packet parsing, attacker-controlled data overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), allowing arbitrary code execution in the context of the service. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication and may lead to full system compromise on affected Windows hosts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 13:56:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2008-20001 | activePDF WebGrabber ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-20001</link><description>activePDF WebGrabber version 3.8.2.0 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the GetStatus() method of the APWebGrb.ocx ActiveX control.

f2fs: fix to avoid out-of-boundary access in dnode page

The root cause is in the corrupted image, there is a dnode has the same
node id w/ its inode, so during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data(), it tries to
access block address in dnode at offset 934, however it parses the dnode
as inode node, so that get_dnode_addr() returns 360, then it tries to
access page address from 360 + 934 * 4 = 4096 w/ 4 bytes.

To fix this issue, let's add sanity check for node id of all direct nodes
during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data().</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:30:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9681 | O2OA Personal Profile agent cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9681</link><description>A flaw has been found in O2OA up to 10.0-410.
