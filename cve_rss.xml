A vulnerability present in versions prior to 0.3.9 involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl. The library fetches QE Identity collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report. An attacker can forge the QE Identity data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting Enclave. This allows the attacker to forge the QE and sign untrusted quotes that the verifier will accept as valid. Effectively, this bypasses the entire remote attestation security model, as the verifier can no longer trust the entity responsible for signing the quotes. All deployments utilizing the dcap-qvl library for SGX or TDX quote verification are affected. The vulnerability has been patched in dcap-qvl version 0.3.9. The fix implements the missing cryptographic verification for the QE Identity signature and enforces the required checks for MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, and ISVSVN against the QE Report. Users of the `@phala/dcap-qvl-node` and `@phala/dcap-qvl-web` packages should switch to the pure JavaScript implementation, `@phala/dcap-qvl`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users must upgrade to the patched version to ensure that QE Identity collateral is properly verified.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:42:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22709 | vm2 has a Sandbox Escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22709</link><description>vm2 is an open source vm/sandbox for Node.js. In vm2 prior to version 3.10.2, `Promise.prototype.then` `Promise.prototype.catch` callback sanitization can be bypassed. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code. In lib/setup-sandbox.js, the callback function of `localPromise.prototype.then` is sanitized, but `globalPromise.prototype.then` is not sanitized. The return value of async functions is `globalPromise` object. Version 3.10.2 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:42:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1443 | code-projects Online Music Site AdminDeleteUser.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1443</link><description>A flaw has been found in code-projects Online Music Site 1.0.

This algorithm uses a simple XOR encryption technique combined with a cryptographic key (cryptoKey) to transform each character of the input string. However, it's important to note that this implementation does not provide strong encryption and should not be considered secure for sensitive data. It's more of a custom encryption approach rather than a common algorithm used in cryptographic applications. The key itself is static and based on the founder's name of the company. The functionality is for example used to encrypt the user PINs before storing them in the MSSQL database.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59096 | Weak Default Password in dormakaba Kaba exos 9300</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59096</link><description>The default password for the extended admin user mode in the application U9ExosAdmin.exe ("Kaba 9300 Administration") is hard-coded in multiple locations as well as documented in the locally stored user documentation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59097 | Unauthenticated SOAP API in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59097</link><description>The exos 9300 application can be used to configure Access Managers (e.g. 92xx, 9230 and 9290). The configuration is done in a graphical user interface on the dormakaba exos server. As soon as the save button is clicked in exos 9300, the whole configuration is sent to the selected Access Manager via SOAP. The SOAP request is sent without any prior authentication or authorization by default. Though authentication and authorization can be configured using IPsec for 92xx-K5 devices and mTLS for 92xx-K7 devices, it is not enabled by default and must therefore be activated with additional steps.

This insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:
- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)
- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs
- Open all connected doors permanently
- Open all doors for a defined time interval
- Change the admin password
- and many more

Network level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls. Devices with an insecure configuration have been identified to be directly exposed to the internet.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59098 | Trace Functionality Leaking Sensitive Data in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59098</link><description>The Access Manager is offering a trace functionality to debug errors and issues with the device. The trace functionality is implemented as a simple TCP socket. A tool called TraceClient.exe, provided by dormakaba via the Access Manager web interface, is used to connect to the socket and receive debug information. The data is permanently broadcasted on the TCP socket. The socket can be accessed without any authentication or encryption. 

The transmitted data is based on the set verbosity level. The verbosity level can be set using the http(s) endpoint with the service interface password or with the guessable identifier of the device via the SOAP interface.

The transmitted data contains sensitive data like the Card ID as well as all button presses on Registration units. This allows an attacker with network level access to retrieve all entered PINs on a registration unit.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59099 | Unauthenticated Path Traversal in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59099</link><description>The Access Manager is using the open source web server CompactWebServer written in C#. This web server is affected by a path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to directly access files via simple GET requests without prior authentication. 

Hence, it is possible to retrieve all files stored on the file system, including the SQLite database Database.sq3, containing badge information and the corresponding PIN codes. Additionally, when trying to access certain files, the web server crashes and becomes unreachable for about 60 seconds. This can be abused to continuously send the request and cause denial of service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59100 | Unauthenticated Access to the SQLite Database in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59100</link><description>The web interface offers a functionality to export the internal SQLite database. After executing the database export, an automatic download is started and the device reboots. After rebooting, the exported database is deleted and cannot be accessed anymore. However, it was noticed that sometimes the device does not reboot and therefore the exported database is not deleted, or the device reboots and the export is not deleted for unknown reasons. The path where the database export is located can be accessed without prior authentication. This leads to the fact that an attacker might be able to get access to the exported database without prior authentication. 
The database includes sensitive data like passwords, card pins, encrypted Mifare sitekeys and much more.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59101 | Insufficient Session Management in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59101</link><description>Instead of typical session tokens or cookies, it is verified on a per-request basis if the originating IP address has once successfully logged in.

Combined with the fact that an attacker can easily get access to the backup functionality by abusing the session management issue (CVE-2025-59101), or by exploiting the weak default password (CVE-2025-59108), or by simply setting a new password without prior authentication via the SOAP API (CVE-2025-59097), it is easily possible to access the sensitive data on the device.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59103 | Weak Default Passwords for SSH Access in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59103</link><description>The Access Manager 92xx in hardware revision K7 is based on Linux instead of Windows CE embedded in older hardware revisions. In this new hardware revision it was noticed that an SSH service is exposed on port 22. By analyzing the firmware of the devices, it was noticed that there are two users with hardcoded and weak passwords that can be used to access the devices via SSH. The passwords can be also guessed very easily. The password of at least one user is set to a random value after the first deployment, with the restriction that the password is only randomized if the configured date is prior to 2022. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the passwords are not randomized. For example, if the clock is never set on the device, the battery of the clock module has been changed, the Access Manager has been factory reset and has not received a time yet.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59104 | Unlocked Bootloader in dormakaba access manager</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59104</link><description>With physical access to the device and enough time an attacker is able to solder test leads to the debug footprint (or use the 6-Pin tag-connect cable).

dmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free

A use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams
are terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs
when the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the
vchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.

The race condition follows this sequence:

  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the
     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)
  2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which
     frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()
  3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()
     which attempts to access the already-freed memory

Since tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is
no guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete()
runs.

Fix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:
 - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the
   descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.
 - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls
   vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any
   terminated descriptors.

nvme-tcp: fix NULL pointer dereferences in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec

Commit efa56305908b ("nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length")
added ttag bounds checking and data_offset
validation in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), but it did not validate
whether the command's data structures (cmd-&gt;req.sg and cmd-&gt;iov) have
been properly initialized before processing H2C_DATA PDUs.

The nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() function dereferences these pointers
without NULL checks. This can be triggered by sending H2C_DATA PDU
immediately after the ICREQ/ICRESP handshake, before
sending a CONNECT command or NVMe write command.

Attack vectors that trigger NULL pointer dereferences:
1. H2C_DATA PDU sent before CONNECT → both pointers NULL
2. H2C_DATA PDU for READ command → cmd-&gt;req.sg allocated, cmd-&gt;iov NULL
3. H2C_DATA PDU for uninitialized command slot → both pointers NULL

The fix validates both cmd-&gt;req.sg and cmd-&gt;iov before calling
nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec(). Both checks are required because:
- Uninitialized commands: both NULL
- READ commands: cmd-&gt;req.sg allocated, cmd-&gt;iov NULL
- WRITE commands: both allocated</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22999 | net/sched: sch_qfq: do not free existing class in qfq_change_class()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-22999</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix crash on profile change rollback failure

mlx5e_netdev_change_profile can fail to attach a new profile and can
fail to rollback to old profile, in such case, we could end up with a
dangling netdev with a fully reset netdev_priv. A retry to change
profile, e.g. another attempt to call mlx5e_netdev_change_profile via
switchdev mode change, will crash trying to access the now NULL
priv-&gt;mdev.

This fix allows mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() to handle previous
failures and an empty priv, by not assuming priv is valid.

Pass netdev and mdev to all flows requiring
mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() and avoid passing priv.
In mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() check if current priv is valid, and if
not, just attach the new profile without trying to access the old one.

This fixes the following oops, when enabling switchdev mode for the 2nd
time after first time failure:

macvlan: fix possible UAF in macvlan_forward_source()

Add RCU protection on (struct macvlan_source_entry)-&gt;vlan.

Whenever macvlan_hash_del_source() is called, we must clear
entry-&gt;vlan pointer before RCU grace period starts.

This allows macvlan_forward_source() to skip over
entries queued for freeing.

Note that macvlan_dev are already RCU protected, as they
are embedded in a standard netdev (netdev_priv(ndev)).

lib/buildid: use __kernel_read() for sleepable context

Prevent a "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference in
filemap_read_folio".

For the sleepable context, convert freader to use __kernel_read() instead
of direct page cache access via read_cache_folio().  This simplifies the
faultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface
which handles all the complexity of reading file data.

At the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which
uses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are
already in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple
and easier to backport to stable kernels.

Syzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run
successfully.

In the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for
non-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the
secretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the
buildid code.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23003 | ip6_tunnel: use skb_vlan_inet_prepare() in __ip6_tnl_rcv()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23003</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dst: fix races in rt6_uncached_list_del() and rt_del_uncached_list()

syzbot was able to crash the kernel in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()
in an interesting way [1]

Crash happens in list_del_init()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() while writing
list-&gt;prev, while the prior write on list-&gt;next went well.

static inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;next, list); // This went well
	WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;prev, list); // Crash, @list has been freed.
}

Issue here is that rt6_uncached_list_del() did not attempt to lock
ul-&gt;lock, as list_empty(&amp;amp;rt-&gt;dst.rt_uncached) returned
true because the WRITE_ONCE(list-&gt;next, list) happened on the other CPU.

We might use list_del_init_careful() and list_empty_careful(),
or make sure rt6_uncached_list_del() always grabs the spinlock
whenever rt-&gt;dst.rt_uncached_list has been set.

A similar fix is neeed for IPv4.

x86/fpu: Clear XSTATE_BV[i] in guest XSAVE state whenever XFD[i]=1

When loading guest XSAVE state via KVM_SET_XSAVE, and when updating XFD in
response to a guest WRMSR, clear XFD-disabled features in the saved (or to
be restored) XSTATE_BV to ensure KVM doesn't attempt to load state for
features that are disabled via the guest's XFD.  Because the kernel
executes XRSTOR with the guest's XFD, saving XSTATE_BV[i]=1 with XFD[i]=1
will cause XRSTOR to #NM and panic the kernel.

E.g. if fpu_update_guest_xfd() sets XFD without clearing XSTATE_BV:

The new behavior is consistent with the AMX architecture.  Per Intel's SDM,
XSAVE saves XSTATE_BV as '0' for components that are disabled via XFD
(and non-compacted XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the state
component):

  If XSAVE, XSAVEC, XSAVEOPT, or XSAVES is saving the state component i,
  the instruction does not generate #NM when XCR0[i] = IA32_XFD[i] = 1;
  instead, it operates as if XINUSE[i] = 0 (and the state component was
  in its initial state): it saves bit i of XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE
  header as 0; in addition, XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the
  state component (the other instructions do not save state component i).

Alternatively, KVM could always do XRSTOR with XFD=0, e.g. by using
a constant XFD based on the set of enabled features when XSAVEing for
a struct fpu_guest.  However, having XSTATE_BV[i]=1 for XFD-disabled
features can only happen in the above interrupt case, or in similar
scenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, because
fpu_swap_kvm_fpstate()'s call to save_fpregs_to_fpstate() saves the
outgoing FPU state with the current XFD; and that is (on all but the
first WRMSR to XFD) the guest XFD.

Therefore, XFD can only go out of sync with XSTATE_BV in the above
interrupt case, or in similar scenarios involving preemption on
preemptible kernels, and it we can consider it (de facto) part of KVM
ABI that KVM_GET_XSAVE returns XSTATE_BV[i]=0 for XFD-disabled features.

block: zero non-PI portion of auto integrity buffer

The auto-generated integrity buffer for writes needs to be fully
initialized before being passed to the underlying block device,
otherwise the uninitialized memory can be read back by userspace or
anyone with physical access to the storage device. If protection
information is generated, that portion of the integrity buffer is
already initialized. The integrity data is also zeroed if PI generation
is disabled via sysfs or the PI tuple size is 0. However, this misses
the case where PI is generated and the PI tuple size is nonzero, but the
metadata size is larger than the PI tuple. In this case, the remainder
("opaque") of the metadata is left uninitialized.
Generalize the BLK_INTEGRITY_CSUM_NONE check to cover any case when the
metadata is larger than just the PI tuple.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23008 | drm/vmwgfx: Fix KMS with 3D on HW version 10</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xhci: sideband: don't dereference freed ring when removing sideband endpoint

xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint() incorrecly assumes that the endpoint is
running and has a valid transfer ring.

Lianqin reported a crash during suspend/wake-up stress testing, and
found the cause to be dereferencing a non-existing transfer ring
'ep-&gt;ring' during xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint().

The endpoint and its ring may be in unknown state if this function
is called after xHCI was reinitialized in resume (lost power), or if
device is being re-enumerated, disconnected or endpoint already dropped.

Fix this by both removing unnecessary ring access, and by checking
ep-&gt;ring exists before dereferencing it. Also make sure endpoint is
running before attempting to stop it.

Remove the xhci_initialize_ring_info() call during sideband endpoint
removal as is it only initializes ring structure enqueue, dequeue and
cycle state values to their starting values without changing actual
hardware enqueue, dequeue and cycle state. Leaving them out of sync
is worse than leaving it as it is. The endpoint will get freed in after
this in most usecases.

If the (audio) class driver want's to reuse the endpoint after offload
then it is up to the class driver to ensure endpoint is properly set up.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23010 | ipv6: Fix use-after-free in inet6_addr_del().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Analog to commit db5b4e39c4e6 ("ip6_gre: make ip6gre_header() robust")

Over the years, syzbot found many ways to crash the kernel
in ipgre_header() [1].

This involves team or bonding drivers ability to dynamically
change their dev-&gt;needed_headroom and/or dev-&gt;hard_header_len

In this particular crash mld_newpack() allocated an skb
with a too small reserve/headroom, and by the time mld_sendpack()
was called, syzbot managed to attach an ipgre device.

mm/damon/core: remove call_control in inactive contexts

If damon_call() is executed against a DAMON context that is not running,
the function returns error while keeping the damon_call_control object
linked to the context's call_controls list.  Let's suppose the object is
deallocated after the damon_call(), and yet another damon_call() is
executed against the same context.  The function tries to add the new
damon_call_control object to the call_controls list, which still has the
pointer to the previous damon_call_control object, which is deallocated. 
As a result, use-after-free happens.

This can actually be triggered using the DAMON sysfs interface.  It is not
easily exploitable since it requires the sysfs write permission and making
a definitely weird file writes, though.  Please refer to the report for
more details about the issue reproduction steps.

Fix the issue by making two changes.  Firstly, move the final
kdamond_call() for cancelling all existing damon_call() requests from
terminating DAMON context to be done before the ctx-&gt;kdamond reset.  This
makes any code that sees NULL ctx-&gt;kdamond can safely assume the context
may not access damon_call() requests anymore.  Secondly, let damon_call()
to cleanup the damon_call_control objects that were added to the
already-terminated DAMON context, before returning the error.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:50:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23013 | net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23013</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback

octep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue IRQs with dev_id set to

free_irq() with dev_id set to 'oct', which does not match the original

unwind/teardown, leading to a use-after-free or crash when an interrupt

In versions 0.9rc2 and below, avahi-daemon can be crashed via a segmentation fault by sending an unsolicited mDNS response containing a recursive CNAME record, where the alias and canonical name point to the same domain (e.g., "h.local" as a CNAME for "h.local"). This causes unbounded recursion in the lookup_handle_cname function, leading to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability affects record browsers where AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_MULTICAST is set explicitly, which includes record browsers created by resolvers used by nss-mdns.
