Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Postfix supports &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; but some other popular e-mail servers do not. To prevent attack variants (by always disallowing &lt;LF&gt; without &lt;CR&gt;), a different solution is required: the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option with a Postfix minimum version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 05:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51763 | csv_builder.rb in ActiveAdmin (aka Active Admin) before 3.2.0 allows CSV injection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51763</link><description>csv_builder.rb in ActiveAdmin (aka Active Admin) before 3.2.0 allows CSV injection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 03:28:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
