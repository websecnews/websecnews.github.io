In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token. Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace, but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired. Any Coder workspace templates that persist this automatically generated session token are potentially impacted. This is fixed in versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 03:09:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10003 | UsersWP – Front-end login form, User Registration, User Profile &amp;amp; Members Directory plugin for WP &amp;lt;= 1.2.44 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10003</link><description>The UsersWP – Front-end login form, User Registration, User Profile &amp; Members Directory plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘upload_file_remove’ function and 'htmlvar' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.44 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

Versions 3.25.23 and below contain a default list of allowed commands that do not need manual approval if auto-approve is enabled, and npm install is included in that list. Because npm install executes lifecycle scripts, if a repository’s package.json file contains a malicious postinstall script, it would be executed automatically without user approval. This means that enabling auto-approved commands and opening a malicious repo could result in arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 3.26.0.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 02:33:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8359 | AdForest &amp;lt;= 6.0.9 - Authentication Bypass to Admin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8359</link><description>The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9.

s390/mm: Do not map lowcore with identity mapping

Since the identity mapping is pinned to address zero the lowcore is always
also mapped to address zero, this happens regardless of the relocate_lowcore
command line option. If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped
twice, instead of only once.

This means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an
exception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts).
To fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the
identity mapping.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38734 | net/smc: fix UAF on smcsk after smc_listen_out()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38734</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The direct cause of this issue is that after smc_listen_out_connected(),
newclcsock-&gt;sk may be NULL since it will releases the smcsk. Therefore,
if the application closes the socket immediately after accept,
newclcsock-&gt;sk can be NULL. A possible execution order could be as
follows:

smc_listen_work                                 | userspace
-----------------------------------------------------------------
lock_sock(sk)                                   |

                                                | fd = accept();
                                                | close(fd);
                                                |  \- socket-&gt;sk = NULL;
/* newclcsock-&gt;sk is NULL now */
SMC_STAT_SERV_SUCC_INC(sock_net(newclcsock-&gt;sk))

Since smc_listen_out_connected() will not fail, simply swapping the order
of the code can easily fix this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38735 | gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38735</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown

A crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invoked
after shutdown() is called.

shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operations
without performing expensive deallocations. It is discouraged to
unregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visible
to userspace and kernel helpers.

In gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If an
ethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereference
freed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful
shutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot
syscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger
this path.

Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().
This marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler
will skip dispatching operations to the driver.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38736 | net: usb: asix_devices: Fix PHY address mask in MDIO bus initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38736</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_path

ppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:

1. The ppp-&gt;channels list can change between list_empty() and
   list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel
   is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may
   access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.

2. pch-&gt;chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,
   pch-&gt;chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp-&gt;channels.

Fix these by using a lockless RCU approach:
- Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list
  entry.
- Convert list modifications on ppp-&gt;channels to their RCU variants and
  add synchronize_net() after removal.
- Check for a NULL pch-&gt;chan before dereferencing it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39674 | scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39674</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference

ESI/MSI is a performance optimization feature that provides dedicated
interrupts per MCQ hardware queue. This is optional feature and UFS MCQ
should work with and without ESI feature.

Commit e46a28cea29a ("scsi: ufs: qcom: Remove the MSI descriptor abuse")
brings a regression in ESI (Enhanced System Interrupt) configuration that
causes a null pointer dereference when Platform MSI allocation fails.

The issue occurs in when platform_device_msi_init_and_alloc_irqs() in
ufs_qcom_config_esi() fails (returns -EINVAL) but the current code uses
__free() macro for automatic cleanup free MSI resources that were never
successfully allocated.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
address 0000000000000008

  Call trace:

Fix by restructuring the ESI configuration to try MSI allocation first,
before any other resource allocation and instead use explicit cleanup
instead of __free() macro to avoid cleanup of unallocated resources.

Tested on SM8750 platform with MCQ enabled, both with and without
Platform ESI support.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39675 | drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check in mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39675</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal

This issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and
fq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new
limit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the
subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:

   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will
   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,
   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of
   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling
   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a
   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the
   new limit in their change handlers.

   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to
   support a limit of 0):

   export TARGET=fq
   tc qdisc del dev lo root
   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000
   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null
   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0
   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq
   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo

   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive
   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the
   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers
   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an
   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).

To fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal
has been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.
qdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that
do not directly use the dequeue handler.

The old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to
the subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.
However, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also
potentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the
non gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39678 | platform/x86/amd/hsmp: Ensure sock-&amp;gt;metric_tbl_addr is non-NULL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39678</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resctrl_cpu_detect() has been moved from common CPU initialization code to

This triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on our

tls: fix handling of zero-length records on the rx_list

Each recvmsg() call must process either
 - only contiguous DATA records (any number of them)
 - one non-DATA record

If the next record has different type than what has already been
processed we break out of the main processing loop. If the record
has already been decrypted (which may be the case for TLS 1.3 where
we don't know type until decryption) we queue the pending record
to the rx_list. Next recvmsg() will pick it up from there.

Queuing the skb to rx_list after zero-copy decrypt is not possible,
since in that case we decrypted directly to the user space buffer,
and we don't have an skb to queue (darg.skb points to the ciphertext
skb for access to metadata like length).

Only data records are allowed zero-copy, and we break the processing
loop after each non-data record. So we should never zero-copy and
then find out that the record type has changed. The corner case
we missed is when the initial record comes from rx_list, and it's
zero length.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39683 | tracing: Limit access to parser-&amp;gt;buffer when trace_get_user failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39683</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()

syzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel
buffer is allocated to hold `insn-&gt;n` samples (each of which is an
`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn-&gt;n` samples are
copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The
problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return
data to userspace fill in the whole `insn-&gt;n` samples, so that there is
an information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at
the time of writing.

One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have
a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`
handler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if
`insn-&gt;n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn-&gt;n - 1` samples copied
to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.

Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the "vm80xx" driver.  It
never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.

Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure
that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before
handling each instruction.

comedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number

The reproducer passed in an irq number(0x80008000) that was too large,
which triggered the oob.

Added an interrupt number check to prevent users from passing in an irq
number that was too large.

If `it-&gt;options[1]` is 31, then `1 &lt;&lt; it-&gt;options[1]` is still invalid
because it shifts a 1-bit into the sign bit (which is UB in C).
Possible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the
`it-&gt;options[1]` value to 30 or lower, or using `1U &lt;&lt; it-&gt;options[1]`.

The old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the
`options[1]` value were invalid.  And it would still configure the
device without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an
error.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39686 | comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn-&amp;gt;n samples</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39686</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn-&gt;n samples

The `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for
`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for
`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default
handler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler
for `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed
`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`
instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,
indicated by the `insn-&gt;n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently
only handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will
copy `insn-&gt;n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASAN
kernel-infoleak errors when `insn-&gt;n` was greater than 1, but that is
being fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)

Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn-&gt;n` samples, or return
an error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and
`INSN_WRITE` handlers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39687 | iio: light: as73211: Ensure buffer holes are zeroed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39687</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Also allocate and copy hash for reading of filter files

Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace just adds
the pointer to the global tracer hash to its iterator. Unlike the writer
that allocates a copy of the hash, the reader keeps the pointer to the
filter hashes. This is problematic because this pointer is static across
function calls that release the locks that can update the global tracer
hashes. This can cause UAF and similar bugs.

Allocate and copy the hash for reading the filter files like it is done
for the writers. This not only fixes UAF bugs, but also makes the code a
bit simpler as it doesn't have to differentiate when to free the
iterator's hash between writers and readers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39690 | iio: accel: sca3300: fix uninitialized iio scan data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39690</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In the mpage_read_folio() function, the stack variable 'map_bh' is
passed to ntfs_get_block_vbo(). Once unlock_buffer() unlocks and
wait_on_buffer() returns to continue processing, the stack variable
is likely to be reclaimed. Consequently, during the end_buffer_read_sync()
process, calling put_bh() may result in stack overrun.

If the bh is not allocated on the stack, it belongs to a folio.  Freeing
a buffer head which belongs to a folio is done by drop_buffers() which
will fail to free buffers which are still locked.  So it is safe to call
put_bh() before __end_buffer_read_notouch().</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39692 | smb: server: split ksmbd_rdma_stop_listening() out of ksmbd_rdma_destroy()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39692</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present check

Tracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exits
if the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check is
performed after physical to virtual address translation.

If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address zero, the
resulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won't
work. Subsequently this may result in incorrect accesses to the first
page of the identity mapping.

Fix this by introducing a function that handles the NULL case before

NFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write

After nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is
still attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to
nfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the
page group.
The reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't
necessarily have a lock on the page group head.

So in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in
nfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the

This issue was found by syzkaller.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a
corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it
attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and
skb_push() panics.

The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a
sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific
corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG).

Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to
contain both ethernet and hsr headers.

Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push()
in br_dev_queue_push_xmit().

In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily
see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

drm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability

[Why]
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver's
(DC module) cleanup function dc_destruct().
When display control context (dc-&gt;ctx) construction fails
(due to memory allocation failure), this pointer remains NULL.
During subsequent error handling when dc_destruct() is called,
there's no NULL check before dereferencing the perf_trace member
(dc-&gt;ctx-&gt;perf_trace), causing a kernel null pointer dereference crash.

[How]
Check if dc-&gt;ctx is non-NULL before dereferencing.

media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

Both the ACE and CSI driver are missing a mei_cldev_disable() call in
their remove() function.

This causes the mei_cl client to stay part of the mei_device-&gt;file_list
list even though its memory is freed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() calling
kfree(cldev-&gt;cl).

This leads to a use-after-free when mei_vsc_remove() runs mei_stop()
which first removes all mei bus devices calling mei_ace_remove() and
mei_csi_remove() followed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() and then calls
mei_cl_all_disconnect() which walks over mei_device-&gt;file_list dereferecing
the just freed cldev-&gt;cl.

And mei_vsc_remove() it self is run at shutdown because of the
platform_device_unregister(tp-&gt;pdev) in vsc_tp_shutdown()

When building a kernel with KASAN this leads to the following KASAN report:

media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()

In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on
rain-&gt;buf_len is performed before acquiring rain-&gt;buf_lock. This
creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as
rain-&gt;buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work
handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.

Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len
before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both
interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len
beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.

Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full
check. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification
are performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding
spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the
lock.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39714 | media: usbtv: Lock resolution while streaming</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39714</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

access support is implemented, read access interruptions are only

open_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE

As described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series "fs: allow
changing idmappings"'), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary in order to
allow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed
without the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason,
mount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.

However, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 ("fs: allow changing
idmappings") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling
open_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.

can_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached
mountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns()
check), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have
their be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues
as described in the merge commit, and was likely unintentional.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39718 | vsock/virtio: Validate length in packet header before skb_put()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39718</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown

Repeated loading and unloading of a device specific QAT driver, for
example qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a
use-after-free scenario. This occurs when a power management (PM)
interrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,
qat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains
loaded.

Since the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all
devices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the
device-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this
routine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed
memory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa000002e50a01c

To prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to

workqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness
and stability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39722 | crypto: caam - Prevent crash on suspend with iMX8QM / iMX8ULP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39722</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Since the CAAM on these SoCs is managed by another ARM core, called the
SECO (Security Controller) on iMX8QM and Secure Enclave on iMX8ULP, which
also reserves access to register page 0 suspend operations cannot touch
this page.

This is similar to when running OPTEE, where OPTEE will reserve page 0.

Track this situation using a new state variable no_page0, reflecting if
page 0 is reserved elsewhere, either by other management cores in SoC or
by OPTEE.

Replace the optee_en check in suspend/resume with the new check.

optee_en cannot go away as it's needed elsewhere to gate OPTEE specific
situations.

netfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling

If all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest
collector doesn't update the stream-&gt;transferred value and it retains its
initial LONG_MAX value.  Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we
take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set
in wreq-&gt;transferred - which is then returned from -&gt;write_iter().

LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be
quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream-&gt;transferred -
but this only works if we've set any of them.

Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in
stream-&gt;transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the
values.  stream-&gt;transferred can then be initialised to zero.

This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with
cache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up
all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC.
This causes -&gt;write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning
wreq-&gt;transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought
the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would
then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops
when it overran.  The kernel log showed:

    CIFS: VFS: Send error in write = -28

followed by:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008

with:

    RIP: 0010:iter_file_splice_write+0x3a4/0x520
    do_splice+0x197/0x4e0

or:

    RIP: 0010:pipe_buf_release (include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:282)
    iter_file_splice_write (fs/splice.c:755)

Also put a warning check into splice to announce if -&gt;write_iter() returned
that it had written more than it was asked to.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39724 | serial: 8250: fix panic due to PSLVERR</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39724</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250: fix panic due to PSLVERR

When the PSLVERR_RESP_EN parameter is set to 1, the device generates
an error response if an attempt is made to read an empty RBR (Receive
Buffer Register) while the FIFO is enabled.

In serial8250_do_startup(), calling serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR,
UART_LCR_WLEN8) triggers dw8250_check_lcr(), which invokes
dw8250_force_idle() and serial8250_clear_and_reinit_fifos(). The latter
function enables the FIFO via serial_out(p, UART_FCR, p-&gt;fcr).
Execution proceeds to the serial_port_in(port, UART_RX).
This satisfies the PSLVERR trigger condition.

When another CPU (e.g., using printk()) is accessing the UART (UART
is busy), the current CPU fails the check (value &amp; ~UART_LCR_SPAR) ==
(lcr &amp; ~UART_LCR_SPAR) in dw8250_check_lcr(), causing it to enter
dw8250_force_idle().

Put serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR, UART_LCR_WLEN8) under the port-&gt;lock
to fix this issue.

mm/vmscan: fix hwpoisoned large folio handling in shrink_folio_list

In shrink_folio_list(), the hwpoisoned folio may be large folio, which
can't be handled by unmap_poisoned_folio().  For THP, try_to_unmap_one()
must be passed with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD to split huge PMD first and then
retry.  Without TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger null-ptr deref of
pvmw.pte.  Even we passed TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger a
WARN_ON_ONCE due to the page isn't in swapcache.

Since UCE is rare in real world, and race with reclaimation is more rare,
just skipping the hwpoisoned large folio is enough.  memory_failure() will
handle it if the UCE is triggered again.

This happens when memory reclaim for large folio races with
memory_failure(), and will lead to kernel panic.  The race is as
follows:

cpu0      cpu1
 shrink_folio_list memory_failure
  TestSetPageHWPoison
  unmap_poisoned_folio
  --&gt; trigger BUG_ON due to
  unmap_poisoned_folio couldn't

s390/ism: fix concurrency management in ism_cmd()

The s390x ISM device data sheet clearly states that only one
request-response sequence is allowable per ISM function at any point in
time.  Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not
honor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.

This problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states
that for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state
(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence
connections handled by the respective function break, and for future
connection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a
dysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as
well.

A kernel message like
[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a
is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state
with PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like
[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery
is a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered
because the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.

On a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to
the FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU
trying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that
this can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to
PEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the
failure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command
and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs
as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not
the other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about
providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9709 | NRF52810 Runtime EM Fault Injection APPROTECT Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9709</link><description>On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control and Improper Protection against Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EM-FI) in Nordic Semiconductor nRF52810 allow attacker to perform EM Fault Injection and bypass APPROTECT at runtime, requiring the least amount of modification to the hardware system possible.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 17:22:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9999 | Improper validation of payload elements</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9999</link><description>Some payload elements of the messages sent between two stations in a networking architecture are not properly checked on the receiving station allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized commands in the application.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:51:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9998 | Improper validation of packets sequencing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9998</link><description>The sequence of packets received by a Networking server are not correctly checked.

Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 01:42:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58359 | frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce group security</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58359</link><description>ZF FROST is a Rust implementation of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimised Schnorr Threshold signatures). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users. Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:59:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58179 | Astro Cloudflare adapter is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery via /_image endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58179</link><description>Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites.

media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check

Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable number
of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicated
by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the
payload size is not being validated against the actual message length.

This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides a
property count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such a
condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks if
memory beyond the buffer is accessed.

Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload before
each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are
parsed.

This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received
message buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware
behavior.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38680 | media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38680</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()

The buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured
that the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen &gt; 2), buf the function
accesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.

Fix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in
uvc_parse_format().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38681 | mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38681</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()

Memory hot remove unmaps and tears down various kernel page table regions
as required.  The ptdump code can race with concurrent modifications of
the kernel page tables.  When leaf entries are modified concurrently, the
dump code may log stale or inconsistent information for a VA range, but
this is otherwise not harmful.

But when intermediate levels of kernel page table are freed, the dump code
will continue to use memory that has been freed and potentially
reallocated for another purpose.  In such cases, the ptdump code may
dereference bogus addresses, leading to a number of potential problems.

To avoid the above mentioned race condition, platforms such as arm64,
riscv and s390 take memory hotplug lock, while dumping kernel page table
via the sysfs interface /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables.

Similar race condition exists while checking for pages that might have
been marked W+X via /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables/check_wx_pages
which in turn calls ptdump_check_wx().  Instead of solving this race
condition again, let's just move the memory hotplug lock inside generic
ptdump_check_wx() which will benefit both the scenarios.

Drop get_online_mems() and put_online_mems() combination from all existing
platform ptdump code paths.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38682 | i2c: core: Fix double-free of fwnode in i2c_unregister_device()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38682</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: core: Fix double-free of fwnode in i2c_unregister_device()

Before commit df6d7277e552 ("i2c: core: Do not dereference fwnode in struct
device"), i2c_unregister_device() only called fwnode_handle_put() on
of_node-s in the form of calling of_node_put(client-&gt;dev.of_node).

But after this commit the i2c_client's fwnode now unconditionally gets
fwnode_handle_put() on it.

When the i2c_client has no primary (ACPI / OF) fwnode but it does have
a software fwnode, the software-node will be the primary node and
fwnode_handle_put() will put() it.

But for the software fwnode device_remove_software_node() will also put()
it leading to a double free:

net/sched: ets: use old 'nbands' while purging unused classes

Shuang reported sch_ets test-case [1] crashing in ets_class_qlen_notify()
after recent changes from Lion [2]. The problem is: in ets_qdisc_change()
we purge unused DWRR queues; the value of 'q-&gt;nbands' is the new one, and
the cleanup should be done with the old one. The problem is here since my
first attempts to fix ets_qdisc_change(), but it surfaced again after the
recent qdisc len accounting fixes. Fix it purging idle DWRR queues before
assigning a new value of 'q-&gt;nbands', so that all purge operations find a
consistent configuration:

 - old 'q-&gt;nbands' because it's needed by ets_class_find()
 - old 'q-&gt;nstrict' because it's needed by ets_class_is_strict()

fbdev: Fix vmalloc out-of-bounds write in fast_imageblit

This issue triggers when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP by passing console number and frame buffer number.
Ideally this maps console to frame buffer and updates the screen if
console is visible.

As part of mapping it has to do resize of console according to frame
buffer info. if this resize fails and returns from vc_do_resize() and
continues further. At this point console and new frame buffer are mapped
and sets display vars. Despite failure still it continue to proceed
updating the screen at later stages where vc_data is related to previous
frame buffer and frame buffer info and display vars are mapped to new
frame buffer and eventully leading to out-of-bounds write in
fast_imageblit(). This bheviour is excepted only when fg_console is
equal to requested console which is a visible console and updates screen
with invalid struct references in fbcon_putcs().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38686 | userfaultfd: fix a crash in UFFDIO_MOVE when PMD is a migration entry</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38686</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: fix race between polling and detaching

syzbot reports a use-after-free in comedi in the below link, which is
due to comedi gladly removing the allocated async area even though poll
requests are still active on the wait_queue_head inside of it. This can
cause a use-after-free when the poll entries are later triggered or
removed, as the memory for the wait_queue_head has been freed.  We need
to check there are no tasks queued on any of the subdevices' wait queues
before allowing the device to be detached by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`
ioctl.

Tasks will read-lock `dev-&gt;attach_lock` before adding themselves to the
subdevice wait queue, so fix the problem in the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl
handler by write-locking `dev-&gt;attach_lock` before checking that all of
the subdevices are safe to be deleted.  This includes testing for any
sleepers on the subdevices' wait queues.  It remains locked until the
device has been detached.  This requires the `comedi_device_detach()`
function to be refactored slightly, moving the bulk of it into new
function `comedi_device_detach_locked()`.

Note that the refactor of `comedi_device_detach()` results in
`comedi_device_cancel_all()` now being called while `dev-&gt;attach_lock`
is write-locked, which wasn't the case previously, but that does not
matter.

Thanks to Jens Axboe for diagnosing the problem and co-developing this
patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38688 | iommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38688</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow

When allocating IOVA the candidate range gets aligned to the target
alignment. If the range is close to ULONG_MAX then the ALIGN() can
wrap resulting in a corrupted iova.

Open code the ALIGN() using get_add_overflow() to prevent this.
This simplifies the checks as we don't need to check for length earlier
either.

Consolidate the two copies of this code under a single helper.

This bug would allow userspace to create a mapping that overlaps with some
other mapping or a reserved range.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38689 | x86/fpu: Fix NULL dereference in avx512_status()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38689</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Fix NULL dereference in avx512_status()

Problem
-------
With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU enabled, reading /proc/[kthread]/arch_status
causes a warning and a NULL pointer dereference.

This is because the AVX-512 timestamp code uses x86_task_fpu() but
doesn't check it for NULL. CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU addles that function
for kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.

The point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access
task-&gt;fpu after going through kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all
kernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task-&gt;fpu.

Solution
--------
One option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from
x86_task_fpu(). However, that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a
defense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel threads.

Instead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads
altogether. The data was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is
only updated for user threads, not kernel threads.

If anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come
back later and do it properly, separate from this bug fix.

drm/xe/migrate: prevent infinite recursion

If the buf + offset is not aligned to XE_CAHELINE_BYTES we fallback to
using a bounce buffer. However the bounce buffer here is allocated on
the stack, and the only alignment requirement here is that it's
naturally aligned to u8, and not XE_CACHELINE_BYTES. If the bounce
buffer is also misaligned we then recurse back into the function again,
however the new bounce buffer might also not be aligned, and might never
be until we eventually blow through the stack, as we keep recursing.

Instead of using the stack use kmalloc, which should respect the
power-of-two alignment request here. Fixes a kernel panic when
triggering this path through eudebug.

pNFS: Fix uninited ptr deref in block/scsi layout

The error occurs on the third attempt to encode extents. When function
ext_tree_prepare_commit() reallocates a larger buffer to retry encoding
extents, the "layoutupdate_pages" page array is initialized only after the
retry loop. But ext_tree_free_commitdata() is called on every iteration
and tries to put pages in the array, thus dereferencing uninitialized
pointers.

An additional problem is that there is no limit on the maximum possible
buffer_size. When there are too many extents, the client may create a
layoutcommit that is larger than the maximum possible RPC size accepted
by the server.

During testing, we observed two typical scenarios. First, one memory page
for extents is enough when we work with small files, append data to the
end of the file, or preallocate extents before writing. But when we fill
a new large file without preallocating, the number of extents can be huge,
and counting the number of written extents in ext_tree_encode_commit()
does not help much. Since this number increases even more between
unlocking and locking of ext_tree, the reallocated buffer may not be
large enough again and again.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38692 | exfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38692</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Xe can free some of the data pointed to by the dma-fences it exports. Most
notably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes the associated
submit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a
third party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use-
after-free on subsequent access.

To make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly
documented dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period
between signalling a fence and freeing any data pointed to by said fence.

For the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed via kfree_rcu and
for the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace
period before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38704 | rcu/nocb: Fix possible invalid rdp&amp;#x27;s-&amp;gt;nocb_cb_kthread pointer access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38704</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drbd: add missing kref_get in handle_write_conflicts

With `two-primaries` enabled, DRBD tries to detect "concurrent" writes
and handle write conflicts, so that even if you write to the same sector
simultaneously on both nodes, they end up with the identical data once
the writes are completed.

In handling "superseeded" writes, we forgot a kref_get,
resulting in a premature drbd_destroy_device and use after free,
and further to kernel crashes with symptoms.

Relevance: No one should use DRBD as a random data generator, and apparently
all users of "two-primaries" handle concurrent writes correctly on layer up.
That is cluster file systems use some distributed lock manager,
and live migration in virtualization environments stops writes on one node
before starting writes on the other node.

Which means that other than for "test cases",
this code path is never taken in real life.

FYI, in DRBD 9, things are handled differently nowadays.  We still detect
"write conflicts", but no longer try to be smart about them.
We decided to disconnect hard instead: upper layers must not submit concurrent
writes. If they do, that's their fault.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38709 | loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38709</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner

Syzbot came up with a reproducer where a loop device block size is
changed underneath a mounted filesystem. This causes a mismatch between
the block device block size and the block size stored in the superblock
causing confusion in various places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular
issue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow() due to
requested buffer size not matching block device block size.

Fix the problem by getting exclusive hold of the loop device to change
its block size. This fails if somebody (such as filesystem) has already
an exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying
the loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn't expect it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38710 | gfs2: Validate i_depth for exhash directories</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38710</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Validate i_depth for exhash directories

A fuzzer test introduced corruption that ends up with a depth of 0 in
dir_e_read(), causing an undefined shift by 32 at:

  index = hash &gt;&gt; (32 - dip-&gt;i_depth);

As calculated in an open-coded way in dir_make_exhash(), the minimum
depth for an exhash directory is ilog2(sdp-&gt;sd_hash_ptrs) and 0 is
invalid as sdp-&gt;sd_hash_ptrs is fixed as sdp-&gt;bsize / 16 at mount time.

So we can avoid the undefined behaviour by checking for depth values
lower than the minimum in gfs2_dinode_in(). Values greater than the
maximum are already being checked for there.

Also switch the calculation in dir_make_exhash() to use ilog2() to
clarify how the depth is calculated.

Tested with the syzkaller repro.c and xfstests '-g quick'.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38711 | smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38711</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists

If smb2_create_link() is called with ReplaceIfExists set and the name
does exist then a deadlock will happen.

ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_locked() will return with success and the parent
directory will be locked.  ksmbd_vfs_remove_file() will then remove the
file.  ksmbd_vfs_link() will then be called while the parent is still
locked.  It will try to lock the same parent and will deadlock.

This patch moves the ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_unlock() call to *before*
ksmbd_vfs_link() and then simplifies the code, removing the file_present
flag variable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38712 | hfsplus: don&amp;#x27;t use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38712</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: don't use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()

When the volume header contains erroneous values that do not reflect
the actual state of the filesystem, hfsplus_fill_super() assumes that
the attributes file is not yet created, which later results in hitting
BUG_ON() when hfsplus_create_attributes_file() is called. Replace this
BUG_ON() with -EIO error with a message to suggest running fsck tool.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38713 | hfsplus: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in hfsplus_uni2asc()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38713</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzbot found a race condition when kcm_unattach(psock)

kcm_unattach() is missing a check of the flag
kcm-&gt;tx_stopped before calling queue_work().

If the kcm has a reserved psock, kcm_unattach() might get executed
between cancel_work_sync() and unreserve_psock() in kcm_release(),
requeuing kcm-&gt;tx_work right before kcm gets freed in kcm_done().

Remove kcm-&gt;tx_stopped and replace it by the less

net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue

Currently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in
pci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in
pci_error_handlers.reset_done().

However, in the PCI framework:
pci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -
 pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler-&gt;reset_prepare(dev);

In pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked():
	list_for_each_entry(dev, &amp;amp;slot-&gt;bus-&gt;devices, bus_list) {
		if (!dev-&gt;slot || dev-&gt;slot!= slot)
			continue;
		pci_dev_save_and_disable(dev);
		if (dev-&gt;subordinate)
			pci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev-&gt;subordinate);
	}

This will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute
err_handler-&gt;reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver
to sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.

Since the driver now executes netif_device_detach()
before the reset process, it will not concurrently with
other netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.

Therefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and
adjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure
that multiple resets are not executed concurrently.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38721 | netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38721</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump

There is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():
      if (res &lt; 0) {
                nf_conntrack_get(&amp;amp;ct-&gt;ct_general); // HERE
                cb-&gt;args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
                ...

While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.
If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.
This 2nd increment is never undone.

This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn
keeps prevents cnet-&gt;count from dropping back to 0.

This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as
nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.

This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.
It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before
I see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.

One fix would to change this to:
        if (res &lt; 0) {
		if (ct != last)
	                nf_conntrack_get(&amp;amp;ct-&gt;ct_general);

But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.
We can just store a cookie value instead.

A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,
it looks to me as if this has the same problem and like
ctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual
object so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38722 | habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38722</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its -&gt;release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
habanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to
another struct file that will be dropped as part of -&gt;release() for ours;
that "will be" is actually "might have already been".

Fix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install()
only when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer
have the failure exit with file already created, but reference to
underlying file (as well as -&gt;dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet;
unlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38723 | LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38723</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall

Lei Lu recently reported that nfsd4_setclientid_confirm() did not check
the return value from get_client_locked(). a SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM could
race with a confirmed client expiring and fail to get a reference. That
could later lead to a UAF.

Fix this by getting a reference early in the case where there is an
extant confirmed client. If that fails then treat it as if there were no
confirmed client found at all.

In the case where the unconfirmed client is expiring, just fail and
return the result from get_client_locked().</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38725 | net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38725</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy
device will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system
suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will
directly deference member of phydev-&gt;drv for non-main phy devices. Then
NULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or

netlink: avoid infinite retry looping in netlink_unicast()

netlink_attachskb() checks for the socket's read memory allocation
constraints. Firstly, it has:

  rmem &lt; READ_ONCE(sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf)

to check if the just increased rmem value fits into the socket's receive
buffer. If not, it proceeds and tries to wait for the memory under:

  rmem + skb-&gt;truesize &gt; READ_ONCE(sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf)

The checks don't cover the case when skb-&gt;truesize + sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc is
equal to sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf. Thus the function neither successfully accepts
these conditions, nor manages to reschedule the task - and is called in
retry loop for indefinite time which is caught as:

io_uring/net: commit partial buffers on retry

Ring provided buffers are potentially only valid within the single
execution context in which they were acquired. io_uring deals with this
and invalidates them on retry. But on the networking side, if
MSG_WAITALL is set, or if the socket is of the streaming type and too
little was processed, then it will hang on to the buffer rather than
recycle or commit it. This is problematic for two reasons:

1) If someone unregisters the provided buffer ring before a later retry,
   then the req-&gt;buf_list will no longer be valid.

2) If multiple sockers are using the same buffer group, then multiple
   receives can consume the same memory. This can cause data corruption
   in the application, as either receive could land in the same
   userspace buffer.

Fix this by disallowing partial retries from pinning a provided buffer
across multiple executions, if ring provided buffers are used.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:46:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43184 | IBM Jazz Foundation cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43184</link><description>IBM Jazz Foundation 7.0.2 through 7.0.2 iFix033, 7.0.3 through 7.0.3 iFix012, and 7.1.0 through 7.1.0 iFix002 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

This endpoint uses the sites query parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list of site identifiers or keys.

The vulnerability was triggered via the sites parameter, which was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization. 

Exploitation allowed an authenticated attacker with low privileges to extract data from database, perform privilege escalation, or trigger denial-of-service conditions. 

The vulnerability was verified using tools such as SQLMap and confirmed to allow full database exfiltration and potential denial-of-service conditions via crafted payloads.

The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of dotCMS stack: 25.08.14 / 25.07.10-1v2 LTS / 24.12.27v10 LTS / 24.04.24v21 LTS</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:35:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57263 | An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in VX Guestbook 1.07 allows attackers with admin access to inject malicious SQL payloads via th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57263</link><description>An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in VX Guestbook 1.07 allows attackers with admin access to inject malicious SQL payloads via the "word" POST parameter in the words.php admin panel.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:34:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7388 | Authenticated Command Injection via configuration parameter manipulation in exposed RMI interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7388</link><description>It was possible to perform Remote Command Execution (RCE) via Java

Versions below 0.0.2 contain a command injection vulnerability, caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, &gt;, &amp;&amp;, etc.). This issue is fixed in version 0.0.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 01:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9941 | CodeAstro Real Estate Management System register.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9941</link><description>A flaw has been found in CodeAstro Real Estate Management System 1.0.
