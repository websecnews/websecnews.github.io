Prior to 1.4.0, there is an issue where verification signatures for requests sent to Reverb's Pusher-compatible API were not being verified. This API is used in scenarios such as broadcasting a message from a backend service or for obtaining statistical information (such as number of connections) about a given channel. This issue only affects the Pusher-compatible API endpoints and not the WebSocket connections themselves. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the application ID which, should never be exposed, would need to be known by an attacker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 18:16:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7883 | CMSE secure state may leak from stack to floating-point registers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7883</link><description>When using Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), Secure stack 
contents can be leaked to Non-secure state via floating-point registers 
when a Secure to Non-secure function call is made that returns a 
floating-point value and when this is the first use of floating-point 
since entering Secure state. This allows an attacker to read a limited 
quantity of Secure stack contents with an impact on confidentiality.

On macOS, built-in builders (such as `builtin:fetchurl`, exposed to users with `import &lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;`) were not executed in the macOS sandbox. Thus, these builders (which are running under the `nixbld*` users) had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. This issue is fixed in 2.18.9, 2.19.7, 2.20.9, 2.21.5, 2.22.4, 2.23.4, and 2.24.10. Note that sandboxing is not enabled by default on macOS. The Nix sandbox is not primarily intended as a security mechanism, but as an aid to improve reproducibility and purity of Nix builds. However, sandboxing *can* mitigate the impact of other security issues by limiting what parts of the host system a build has access to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:40:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50354 | Out-of-memory during deserialization with crafted inputs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50354</link><description>gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits.

This issue affects Apache Lucene.NET's Replicator library: from 4.8.0-beta00005 through 4.8.0-beta00016.

An attacker that can intercept traffic between a replication client and server, or control the target replication node URL, can provide a specially-crafted JSON response that is deserialized as an attacker-provided exception type. This can result in remote code execution or other potential unauthorized access.


Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.8.0-beta00017, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 10:11:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43984 | WordPress Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin &amp;lt;= 4.1.13 - CSRF to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43984</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Podlove Podlove Podcast Publisher allows Code Injection.This issue affects Podlove Podcast Publisher: from n/a through 4.1.13.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 10:11:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49674 | WordPress  EKC Tournament Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2.1 - CSRF to Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49674</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Lukas Huser EKC Tournament Manager allows Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server.This issue affects EKC Tournament Manager: from n/a through 2.2.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 10:11:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49685 | WordPress Custom Twitter Feeds plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2.3 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49685</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Smash Balloon Custom Twitter Feeds (Tweets Widget) allows Cross Site Request Forgery.This issue affects Custom Twitter Feeds (Tweets Widget): from n/a through 2.2.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 10:11:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30149 | HCL AppScan Source is affected by an expired TLS/SSL certificate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30149</link><description>HCL AppScan Source &lt;= 10.6.0 does not properly validate a TLS/SSL certificate for an executable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 08:44:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9165 | Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages) (WooCommerce Supported) &amp;lt;= 4.4.4 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9165</link><description>The Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages) (WooCommerce Supported) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
