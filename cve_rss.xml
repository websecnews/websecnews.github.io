irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()

The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt
disabled section:

irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
  irq_get_desc_lock()
     raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   &lt;--- Disable interrupts
  its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
     guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   &lt;--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()
  irq_put_desc_unlock()        &lt;--- Warns because interrupts are enabled

This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original
raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).

Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).

gpio: xilinx: Convert gpio_lock to raw spinlock

irq_chip functions may be called in raw spinlock context. Therefore, we
must also use a raw spinlock for our own internal locking.

This fixes the following lockdep splat:

platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race

The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev-&gt;ops is valid when
SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
devm_serdev_device_open().

Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()
calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 11:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13440 | Super Store Finder &amp;lt;= 7.0 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection to Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13440</link><description>The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘ssf_wp_user_name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;-&lt;kbd&gt;p&lt;/kbd&gt; to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:44:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1114 | newbee-mall Add Category Page save cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1114</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in newbee-mall 1.0. Affected is the function save of the file /admin/categories/save of the component Add Category Page. The manipulation of the argument categoryName leads to cross site scripting. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:37:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55630 | DOM Clobbering leads to temporary DOS in the note viewer in Joplin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55630</link><description>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerability's only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:37:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24028 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Rich Text Editor allows arbitrary code execution in Joplin</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24028</link><description>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin's HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However, unlike the Rich Text Editor, the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated`, which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.2.12 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:37:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57357 | An issue in TPLINK TL-WPA 8630 TL-WPA8630(US)_V2_2.0.4 Build 20230427 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via function sub_42...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57357</link><description>An issue in TPLINK TL-WPA 8630 TL-WPA8630(US)_V2_2.0.4 Build 20230427 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via function sub_4256CC, which allows command injection by injecting 'devpwd'.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:27:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57606 | SQL injection vulnerability in Beijing Guoju Information Technology Co., Ltd JeecgBoot v.3.7.2 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57606</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Beijing Guoju Information Technology Co., Ltd JeecgBoot v.3.7.2 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the getTotalData component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:07:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55272 | An issue in Brainasoft Braina v2.8 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the chat window function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55272</link><description>An issue in Brainasoft Braina v2.8 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the chat window function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:07:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57278 | A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in /webscan/sqlmap/index.html in QingScan &lt;=v1.8.0.

Prefix caching makes use of Python's built-in hash() function. As of Python 3.12, the behavior of hash(None) has changed to be a predictable constant value. This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit hash collisions. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior, someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2 and all users are advised to upgrade.

Since Kvrocks didn't detect if "Host:" or "POST" appears in RESP requests,
a valid HTTP request can also be sent to Kvrocks as a valid RESP request 
and trigger some database operations, which can be dangerous when 
it is chained with SSRF.

It is similiar to CVE-2016-10517 in Redis.

This issue affects Apache Kvrocks: from the initial version to the latest version 2.11.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.1, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25071 | WordPress Vignette Ads plugin &amp;lt;= 0.2 - CSRF to Stored XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25071</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in topplugins Vignette Ads allows Stored XSS.
