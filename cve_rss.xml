This issue occurs when flushing TX in the virtio_net_flush_tx function if guest features VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF are enabled. This could allow a malicious user to overwrite local variables allocated on the stack. Specifically, the `out_sg` variable could be used to read a part of process memory and send it to the wire, causing an information leak.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 09:29:45

vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47039</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 05:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26157 | Versions of the package libredwg before 0.12.5.6384 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to an out-of-bounds read involving section...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26157</link><description>Versions of the package libredwg before 0.12.5.6384 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to an out-of-bounds read involving section-&gt;num_pages in decode_r2007.c.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 05:08:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26159 | Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26159</link><description>Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by the url.parse() function. When new URL() throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 05:08:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-32831 | In wlan driver, there is a possible PIN crack due to use of insufficiently random values.
