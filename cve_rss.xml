The client may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate the order of the public key.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 06:13:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6879 | Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) &amp;lt; 9.1.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6879</link><description>The Quiz and Survey Master (QSM)  WordPress plugin before 9.1.1 fails to validate and escape certain Quiz fields before displaying them on a page or post where the Quiz is embedded, which could allows contributor and above roles to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 06:13:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7313 | Shield Security &amp;lt; 20.0.6 - Reflected XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7313</link><description>The Shield Security  WordPress plugin before 20.0.6 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 06:13:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8073 | Command Injection Vulnerability in Hillstone Networks Web Application Firewall</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8073</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Hillstone Networks Hillstone Networks Web Application Firewall on 5.5R6 allows Command Injection.This issue affects Hillstone Networks Web Application Firewall: fromÂ 5.5R6-2.6.7 through 5.5R6-2.8.13.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 02:47:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8154 | SourceCodester QR Code Bookmark System Parameter update-bookmark.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8154</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in SourceCodester QR Code Bookmark System 1.0.

This is due to lib9p not properly verifying that the uname given in the Tauth and Tattach 9p messages matches the client UID returned from the factotum authentication handshake.


The only filesystem making use of these functions within the base 9front systems is the experimental hjfs disk filesystem, other disk filesystems (cwfs and gefs) are not affected by this bug.

This bug was inherited from Plan 9 and is present in all versions of 9front and is remedied fully in commit 9645ae07eb66a59015e3e118d0024790c37400da.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 21:38:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45258 | The req package before 3.43.4 for Go may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided, because cleanHost in http.go intention...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45258</link><description>The req package before 3.43.4 for Go may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided, because cleanHost in http.go intentionally uses a "garbage in, garbage out" design.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 21:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48957 | PureVPN Linux client 2.0.2-Productions fails to properly handle DNS queries, allowing them to bypass the VPN tunnel and be sent directly to ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48957</link><description>PureVPN Linux client 2.0.2-Productions fails to properly handle DNS queries, allowing them to bypass the VPN tunnel and be sent directly to the ISP or default DNS servers.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 16:39:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8011 | Logitech Options+ on MacOS prior 1.72 allows a local attacker to inject dynamic library within Options+ runtime and abuse permissions grante...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8011</link><description>Logitech Options+ on MacOS prior 1.72 allows a local attacker to inject dynamic library within Options+ runtime and abuse permissions granted by the user to Options+ such as Camera.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 11:54:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8147 | code-projects Pharmacy Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8147</link><description>A vulnerability was found in code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.
