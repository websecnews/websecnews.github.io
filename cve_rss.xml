When a user changes their password, the existing list of Access Tokens stay valid instead of expiring. If a user finds that their account has been compromised, they can update their password. In versions up to and including 0.18.1, though, the bad actor will still have access to their account because the bad actor's Access Token stays on the list as a valid token. The user will have to manually delete the bad actor's Access Token to secure their account. The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description which makes it hard to pinpoint a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens. A known patched version of Memos isn't available. To improve Memos security, all Access Tokens will need to be revoked when a user changes their password. This removes the session for all the user's devices and prompts the user to log in again. One can treat the old Access Tokens as "invalid" because those Access Tokens were created with the older password.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:25:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12149 | Unauthorized access to documents protected by Document-Level Security (DLS), when Signal&amp;#x27;s watches include a search query involving protected documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12149</link><description>In Search Guard FLX versions 3.1.2 and earlier, while Document-Level Security (DLS) is correctly enforced elsewhere, when the search is trigged from a Signal's watch, the DLS rule is not enforced, allowing access to all documents in the queried indices.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:25:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11918 | Rockwell Automation Arena® Simulation Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11918</link><description>Rockwell Automation Arena® suffers from a

A vulnerability in versions of Apollo Federation's composition logic prior to 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 allowed some queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface types/fields, which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object types/fields in Apollo Router via inline fragments, for example. A fix to versions 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 of composition logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined access control directives. Some workarounds are available. Users of Apollo Rover with an unpatched composition version or are using the Apollo Studio build pipeline with Federation version 2.8 or below should manually copy the access control requirements on interface types/fields to each implementing object type/field where appropriate. Do not remove those access control requirements from the interface types/fields, as unpatched Apollo Composition will not automatically generate them in the supergraph schema. Customers not using Apollo Router access control features (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives) or not specifying access control requirements on interface types/fields are not affected and do not need to take action.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 23:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13130 | Radarr Service Radarr.Console.exe default permission</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13130</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Radarr 5.28.0.10274.

Prior to version 11.13.0, Directus does not properly clean up field-level permissions when a field is deleted. When a field is removed from a collection, its reference in the permissions table remains intact. This stale reference creates a security gap: if another field is later created using the same name, it inherits the outdated permission entry. This behavior can unintentionally grant roles access to data they should not be able to read or modify. The issue is particularly risky in multi-tenant or production environments, where administrators may reuse field names, assuming old permissions have been fully cleared.

Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.15.6, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Astro's development server error pages when the `trailingSlash` configuration option is used. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context by crafting a malicious URL. While this vulnerability only affects the development server and not production builds, it could be exploited to compromise developer environments through social engineering or malicious links. Version 5.15.6 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:35:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64726 | External Control of System or Configuration Setting and Uncontrolled Search Path Element in sfw</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64726</link><description>Socket Firewall is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server that intercepts package manager requests and enforces security policies by blocking dangerous packages. Socket Firewall binary versions (separate from installers) prior to 0.15.5 are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when run in untrusted project directories. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious `.sfw.config` file in a project directory. When a developer runs Socket Firewall commands (e.g., `sfw npm install`) in that directory, the tool loads the `.sfw.config` file and populates environment variables directly into the Node.js process. An attacker can exploit this by setting `NODE_OPTIONS` with a `--require` directive to execute malicious JavaScript code before Socket Firewall's security controls are initialized, effectively bypassing the tool's malicious package detection. The attack vector is indirect and requires a developer to install dependencies for an untrusted project and execute a command within the context of the untrusted project. The vulnerability has been patched in Socket Firewall version 0.15.5. Users should upgrade to version 0.15.5 or later. The fix isolates configuration file values from subprocess environments. Look at `sfw --version` for version information. If users rely on the recommended installation mechanism (e.g. global installation via `npm install -g sfw`) then no workaround is necessary. This wrapper package automatically ensures that users are running the latest version of Socket Firewall. Users who have manually installed the binary and cannot immediately upgrade should avoid running Socket Firewall in untrusted project directories. Before running Socket Firewall in any new project, inspect `.sfw.config` and `.env.local` files for suspicious `NODE_OPTIONS` or other environment variable definitions that reference local files.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:13:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59840 | Vega Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via expressions abusing toString calls in environments using the VEGA_DEBUG global variable</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59840</link><description>Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 6.2.0, applications meeting 2 conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. They are vulnerable if they use `vega` in an application that attaches `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window` and if they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). Patches are available in the following Vega applications. If using the latest Vega line (6.x), upgrade to `vega` `6.2.0` / `vega-expression` `6.1.0` / `vega-interpreter`  `2.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). If using Vega in a non-ESM environment, upgrade to `vega-expression` `5.2.1` / `1.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). Some workarounds are available. Do not attach `vega` View instances to global variables, and do not attach `vega` to the global window. These practices of attaching the vega library and View instances may be convenient for debugging, but should not be used in production or in any situation where vega/vega-lite definitions could be provided by untrusted parties.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:13:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-4984 | ZenTao Biz &amp;lt; 6.5, Max &amp;lt; 3.0, &amp;amp; Open Source Edition 16.5/16.5beta1 SQL Injection via user-login.html</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4984</link><description>ZenTao Biz &lt; 6.5, ZenTao Max &lt; 3.0, ZenTao Open Source Edition &lt; 16.5, and ZenTao Open Source Edition &lt; 16.5.beta1 contain an SQL injection vulnerability in the login functionality.

Starting in version 2.50.0 and prior to versions 2.71.19, 3.4.4, and 4.6.6, a vulnerability in ZITADEL's federation process allowed auto-linking users from external identity providers to existing users in ZITADEL even if the corresponding IdP was not active or if the organization did not allow federated authentication. This vulnerability stems from the platform's failure to correctly check or enforce an organization's specific security settings during the authentication flow. An Organization Administrator can explicitly disable an IdP or disallow federation, but this setting was not being honored during the auto-linking process. This allowed an unauthenticated attacker to initiate a login using an IdP that should have been disabled for that organization. The platform would incorrectly validate the login and, based on a matching criteria, link the attacker's external identity to an existing internal user account. This may result in a full Account Takeover, bypassing the organization's mandated security controls. Note that accounts with MFA enabled can not be taken over by this attack. Also note that only IdPs create on an instance level would allow this to work. IdPs registered on another organization would always be denied in the (auto-)linking process. Versions 4.6.6, 3.4.4, and 2.71.19 resolve the issue by correctly validating the organization's login policy before auto-linking an external user. No known workarounds are available aside from upgrading.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64718 | js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64718</link><description>js-yaml is a JavaScript YAML parser and dumper.

Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3, an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion exists in the template-switching feature. If `templateselection` is enabled in the configuration, the server trusts the `template` cookie and includes the referenced PHP file. An attacker can read sensitive data or, if they manage to drop a PHP file elsewhere, gain remote code execution. The constructed path of the template file is checked for existence, then included.

Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3, dragging a file whose filename contains HTML is reflected verbatim into the page via the drag-and-drop helper, so any user who drops a crafted file on PrivateBin will execute arbitrary JavaScript within their own session (self-XSS). This allows an attacker who can entice a victim to drag or otherwise attach such a file to exfiltrate plaintext, encryption keys, or stored pastes before they are encrypted or sent. Certain conditions must exist for the vulnerability to be exploitable. Only macOS or Linux users are affected, due to the way the `&gt;` character is treated in a file name on Windows. The PrivateBin instance needs to have file upload enabled. An attacker needs to have access to the local file system or somehow convince the user to create (or download) a malicious file (name). An attacker needs to convince the user to attach that malicious file to PrivateBin. Any Mac / Linux user who can be tricked into dragging a maliciously named file into the editor is impacted; code runs in the origin of the PrivateBin instance they are using. Attackers can steal plaintext, passphrases, or manipulate the UI before data is encrypted, defeating the zero-knowledge guarantees for that victim session, assuming counter-measures like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) have been disabled. If CSP is not disabled, HTML injection attacks may be possible - like redirecting to a foreign website, phishing etc. As the whole exploit needs to be included in the file name of the attached file and only affects the local session of the user (aka it is neither persistent nor remotely executable) and that user needs to interact and actively attach that file to the paste, the impact is considered to be practically low. Version 2.0.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 03:18:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64716 | Anubis vulnerable to possible XSS via redir parameter when using subrequest auth mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64716</link><description>Anubis is a Web AI Firewall Utility that challenges users' connections in order to protect upstream resources from scraper bots. Prior to version 1.23.0, when using subrequest authentication, Anubis did not perform validation of the redirect URL and redirects user to any URL scheme. While most modern browsers do not allow a redirect to `javascript:` URLs, it could still trigger dangerous behavior in some cases. Anybody with a subrequest authentication may be affected. Version 1.23.0 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 03:18:59 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
