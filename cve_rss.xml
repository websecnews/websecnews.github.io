drm/amdgpu: change vm-&gt;task_info handling

This patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm-&gt;task_info object.
The major changes are:
- vm-&gt;task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is
  reference counted.
- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management
    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before
      returning this info
    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info
- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.

This patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage
of vm-&gt;task_info.

V2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)

V3: Fixed review comments from Felix
   - Fix wrong indentation
   - No debug message for -ENOMEM
   - Add NULL check for task_info
   - Do not duplicate the debug messages (ti vs no ti)
   - Get first reference of task_info in vm_init(), put last
     in vm_fini()

V4: Fixed review comments from Felix
   - fix double reference increment in create_task_info
   - change amdgpu_vm_get_task_info_pasid
   - additional changes in amdgpu_gem.c while porting</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 08:27:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52290 | Apache StreamPark (incubating): Unchecked SQL query fields trigger SQL injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52290</link><description>In streampark-console the list pages(e.g: application pages), users can sort page by field. This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage. Since no data will be written, so this is a low-impact vulnerability.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  Such parameters will be blocked.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 07:50:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4780 | Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon &amp;lt;= 1.4.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via eihe_link Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4780</link><description>The Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘eihe_link’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

The ProfileBasedRequestOptionsBuilder method returns allowedCredentials without any credentials if no username was found. When WebAuthn is used as the first or only authentication method, an attacker can enumerate usernames based on the absence of the `allowedCredentials` property in the assertion options response. This allows enumeration of valid or invalid usernames. By knowing which usernames are valid, attackers can focus their efforts on a smaller set of potential targets, increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 19:47:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39915 | Authenticated remote code execution in Thruk</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39915</link><description>Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface for Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken using the Livestatus API. This authenticated RCE in Thruk allows authorized users with network access to inject arbitrary commands via the URL parameter during PDF report generation. The Thruk web application does not properly process the url parameter when generating a PDF report. An authorized attacker with access to the reporting functionality could inject arbitrary commands that would be executed when the script /script/html2pdf.sh is called. The vulnerability can be exploited by an authorized user with network access. This issue has been addressed in version 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 19:47:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40624 | Deserialization of untrusted data in torrentpier/torrentpier</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40624</link><description>TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In `torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php`, `get_tracks()` uses the unsafe native PHP serialization format to deserialize user-controlled cookies. One can use phpggc and the chain Guzzle/FW1 to write PHP code to an arbitrary file, and execute commands on the system. For instance, the cookie bb_t will be deserialized when browsing to viewforum.php. This issue has been addressed in commit `ed37e6e52` which is expected to be included in release version 2.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 19:36:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40627 | OpaMiddleware does not filter HTTP OPTIONS requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40627</link><description>Fastapi OPA is an opensource fastapi middleware which includes auth flow. HTTP `OPTIONS` requests are always allowed by `OpaMiddleware`, even when they lack authentication, and are passed through directly to the application. `OpaMiddleware` allows all HTTP `OPTIONS` requests without evaluating it against any policy. If an application provides different responses to HTTP `OPTIONS` requests based on an entity existing (such as to indicate whether an entity is writable on a system level), an unauthenticated attacker could discover which entities exist within an application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 19:26:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40630 | HEIF Heap OOB Read in OpenImageIO</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40630</link><description>OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production.

Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36432 | An arbitrary memory write vulnerability was discovered in Supermicro X11DPG-HGX2, X11PDG-QT, X11PDG-OT, and X11PDG-SN motherboards with BIOS...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36432</link><description>An arbitrary memory write vulnerability was discovered in Supermicro X11DPG-HGX2, X11PDG-QT, X11PDG-OT, and X11PDG-SN motherboards with BIOS firmware before 4.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36438 | eLinkSmart Hidden Smart Cabinet Lock 2024-05-22 has Incorrect Access Control and fails to perform an authorization check which can lead to c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36438</link><description>eLinkSmart Hidden Smart Cabinet Lock 2024-05-22 has Incorrect Access Control and fails to perform an authorization check which can lead to card duplication and other attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37016 | Mengshen Wireless Door Alarm M70 2024-05-24 allows Authentication Bypass via a Capture-Replay approach.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37016</link><description>Mengshen Wireless Door Alarm M70 2024-05-24 allows Authentication Bypass via a Capture-Replay approach.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39819 | Zoom Workplace Apps and SDK for Windows -

tcp: avoid too many retransmit packets

If a TCP socket is using TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, and the other peer
retracted its window to zero, tcp_retransmit_timer() can
retransmit a packet every two jiffies (2 ms for HZ=1000),
for about 4 minutes after TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has 'expired'.

The fix is to make sure tcp_rtx_probe0_timed_out() takes
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout into account.

Before blamed commit, the socket would not timeout after
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout, but would use standard exponential
backoff for the retransmits.

Also worth noting that before commit e89688e3e978 ("net: tcp:
fix unexcepted socket die when snd_wnd is 0"), the issue
would last 2 minutes instead of 4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32945 | LaTeX post content manipulation via renderer state leak across contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32945</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to protect against abuse of a globally shared MathJax state which allows an attacker to change the contents of a LateX post, by creating another post with specific  macro definitions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39767 | Spoofed push notifications from malicious server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39767</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to validate that the push notifications received for a server actually came from this serve that which allows a malicious server to send push notifications with another server’s diagnostic ID or server URL and have them show up in mobile apps as that server’s push notifications.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6741 | Openfind Mail2000 - HttpOnly flag bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6741</link><description>Openfind's Mail2000 has a vulnerability that allows the HttpOnly flag to be bypassed.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary python code if they can control the input prompt and the server is configured with VectorSQLDatabaseChain.&#13;&#13;**Notes:**&#13;&#13;Impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the vulnerable component:&#13;&#13;Confidentiality: Code execution happens within the impacted component, in this case langchain-experimental, so all resources are necessarily accessible.&#13;&#13;Integrity: There is nothing protected by the impacted component inherently. Although anything returned from the component counts as 'information' for which the trustworthiness can be compromised.&#13;&#13;Availability: The loss of availability isn't caused by the attack itself, but it happens as a result during the attacker's post-exploitation steps.&#13;&#13;&#13;Impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the subsequent system:&#13;&#13;As a legitimate low-privileged user of the package (PR:L) the attacker does not have more access to data owned by the package as a result of this vulnerability than they did with normal usage (e.g. can query the DB). The unintended action that one can perform by breaking out of the app environment and exfiltrating files, making remote connections etc. happens during the post exploitation phase in the subsequent system - in this case, the OS.&#13;&#13;AT:P: An attacker needs to be able to influence the input prompt, whilst the server is configured with the VectorSQLDatabaseChain plugin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 05:10:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6739 | Openfind MailGates and MailAudit - Sensitive Cookie Without &amp;#x27;HttpOnly&amp;#x27; Flag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6739</link><description>The session cookie in MailGates and MailAudit from Openfind does not have the HttpOnly flag enabled, allowing remote attackers to potentially steal the session cookie via XSS.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 03:30:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6738 | WisdomGarden Tronclass - Broken Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6738</link><description>The tumbnail API of Tronclass from WisdomGarden lacks proper access control, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain certain specific files by modifying the URL.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 03:09:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6737 | 2100 TECHNOLOGY Electronic Official Document Management System - Broken Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6737</link><description>The access control in the Electronic Official Document Management System from 2100 TECHNOLOGY  is not properly implemented, allowing remote attackers with regular privileges to access the account settings functionality and create an administrator account.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 02:51:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39729 | IBM Datacap Navigator information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39729</link><description>IBM Datacap Navigator 9.1.5, 9.1.6, 9.1.7, 9.1.8, and 9.1.9 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information from source code that could be used in further attacks against the system.

SUNRPC: Fix UAF in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready()

After the listener svc_sock is freed, and before invoking svc_tcp_accept()
for the established child sock, there is a window that the newsock
retaining a freed listener svc_sock in sk_user_data which cloning from
parent. In the race window, if data is received on the newsock, we will
observe use-after-free report in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready().

Reproduce by two tasks:

1. while :; do rpc.nfsd 0 ; rpc.nfsd; done
2. while :; do echo "" | ncat -4 127.0.0.1 2049 ; done
