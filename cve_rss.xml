overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than
otherwise intended.

This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the
insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like
`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain
of the second host.

(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to
have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for
the domains involved to trigger this problem.)

When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this
bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the
parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.

The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get
converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by
the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its
expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the
(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry
*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier
than otherwise intended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 07:53:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10020 | Heateor Social Login WordPress &amp;lt;= 1.1.35 - Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10020</link><description>The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35.

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occurs on the Osmedues web server when viewing results from the workflow, allowing commands to be executed on the server. When using a workflow that contains the summary module, it generates reports in HTML and Markdown formats. The default report is based on the `general-template.md` template.The contents of the files are read and used to generate the report. However, the file contents are not properly filtered, leading to XSS. This may lead to commands executed on the host as well. This issue is not yet resolved. Users are advised to add their own filtering or to reach out to the developer to aid in developing a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:57:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51746 | Use of incorrect Rekor entries during verification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51746</link><description>Gitsign is a keyless Sigstore to signing tool for Git commits with your a GitHub / OIDC identity. gitsign may select the wrong Rekor entry to use during online verification when multiple entries are returned by the log. gitsign uses Rekor's search API to fetch entries that apply to a signature being verified. The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 18:57:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50332 | Authenticated Blind SQL Injection in DeleteRelationShip in SuiteCRM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50332</link><description>SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application.

The "Publish Key" field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions, such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script, it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users, effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog.  An attacker who successfully talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login link, or a malicious app running on a victim's computer triggering the application key workflow with specially crafted parameters and then redirecting the victim to the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have been patched in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected locations. A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general. The latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping.

scsi: ufs: core: Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down

There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning
of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFS
shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on
blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary.
After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was
waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set
SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down
after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50100 | USB: gadget: dummy-hcd: Fix &amp;quot;task hung&amp;quot; problem</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: gadget: dummy-hcd: Fix "task hung" problem

The syzbot fuzzer has been encountering "task hung" problems ever
since the dummy-hcd driver was changed to use hrtimers instead of
regular timers.  It turns out that the problems are caused by a subtle
difference between the timer_pending() and hrtimer_active() APIs.

The changeover blindly replaced the first by the second.  However,
timer_pending() returns True when the timer is queued but not when its
callback is running, whereas hrtimer_active() returns True when the
hrtimer is queued _or_ its callback is running.  This difference
occasionally caused dummy_urb_enqueue() to think that the callback
routine had not yet started when in fact it was almost finished.  As a
result the hrtimer was not restarted, which made it impossible for the
driver to dequeue later the URB that was just enqueued.  This caused
usb_kill_urb() to hang, and things got worse from there.

Since hrtimers have no API for telling when they are queued and the
callback isn't running, the driver must keep track of this for itself.
That's what this patch does, adding a new "timer_pending" flag and
setting or clearing it at the appropriate times.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50101 | iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50101</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices

Previously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called
pci_for_each_dma_alias() to set up context entries for non-PCI devices.
This could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.

Add a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For
non-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50102 | x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50102</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue

It turns out that AMD has a "Meltdown Lite(tm)" issue with non-canonical
accesses in kernel space.  And so using just the high bit to decide
whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good
old "leak speculative data" if you have the right gadget using the
result:

  CVE-2020-12965 “Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses“

Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those
instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,
which closes the speculation window.

But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].
That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the
speculation window is now open.

Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the
regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm
version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.

It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's no
speculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50103 | ASoC: qcom: Fix NULL Dereference in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to
soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
similar issue).</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50106 | nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid

There is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations
and a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread
finds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it
marks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list
but then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation
happens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing
free_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls
list_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees
the delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not
calling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation
but that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on
the file.

Now, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that
lease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends
up trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the
followint use-after-free KASAN warning:

This patch proposes a fixed that's based on adding 2 new additional
stid's sc_status values that help coordinate between the laundromat
and other operations (nfsd4_free_stateid() and nfsd4_delegreturn()).

First to make sure, that once the stid is marked revoked, it is not
removed by the nfsd4_free_stateid(), the laundromat take a reference
on the stateid. Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put
on the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to
make sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act
accordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before
the arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove
it from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived
before laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state
freed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.

Also, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,
we need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means
the laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this
delegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not
nfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the
lack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50107 | platform/x86/intel/pmc: Fix pmc_core_iounmap to call iounmap for valid addresses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50107</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases

Linear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient
execution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address
Space Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.

Until kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,
or when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,
otherwise keep LAM disabled.

There are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently
nobody is affected by this issue.

firewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent device

In a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 ("firewire: core: use helper functions for self
ID sequence"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored with
some helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions are
guaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application
includes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected
to parent device.

This bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or
more ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path

Upon closer inspection, it appears that we do not properly tear down the
MMIO registration for a vCPU that fails creation late in the game, e.g.
a vCPU w/ the same ID already exists in the VM.

It is important to consider the context of commit that introduced this bug
by moving the unregistration out of __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). That
change correctly sought to avoid an srcu v. config_lock inversion by
breaking up the vCPU teardown into two parts, one guarded by the
config_lock.

Fix the use-after-free while avoiding lock inversion by adding a
special-cased unregistration to __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). This is safe
because failed vCPUs are torn down outside of the config_lock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50115 | KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50115</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50116 | nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50116</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine
was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer
is written normally by log writing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50117 | drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50117</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[CAUSE]
To support mounting different subvolume with different RO/RW flags for
the new mount APIs, btrfs introduced two workaround to support this feature:

- Skip mount option/feature checks if we are mounting a different
  subvolume

- Reconfigure the fs to RW if the initial mount is RO

Combining these two, we can have the following sequence:

- Mount the fs ro,rescue=all,clear_cache,space_cache=v1
  rescue=all will mark the fs as hard read-only, so no v2 cache clearing
  will happen.

- Mount a subvolume rw of the same fs.
  We go into btrfs_get_tree_subvol(), but fc_mount() returns EBUSY
  because our new fc is RW, different from the original fs.

  Now we enter btrfs_reconfigure_for_mount(), which switches the RO flag
  first so that we can grab the existing fs_info.
  Then we reconfigure the fs to RW.

- During reconfiguration, option/features check is skipped
  This means we will restart the v2 cache clearing, and convert back to
  v1 cache.
  This will trigger fs writes, and since the original fs has "rescue=all"
  option, it skips the csum tree read.

  And eventually causing NULL pointer dereference in super block
  writeback.

[FIX]
For reconfiguration caused by different subvolume RO/RW flags, ensure we
always run btrfs_check_options() to ensure we have proper hard RO
requirements met.

In fact the function btrfs_check_options() doesn't really do many
complex checks, but hard RO requirement and some feature dependency
checks, thus there is no special reason not to do the check for mount
reconfiguration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50119 | cifs: fix warning when destroy &amp;#x27;cifs_io_request_pool&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50119</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

a scenario (which causes use-after-free detected by KASAN). Fix this

Eric says:
 It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook()
 after exit()/close() time.
 Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been
 dismantled/freed already.
 bpf_nf_link_attach() does :
 link-&gt;net = net;
 But I do not see a reference being taken on net.

Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg.
Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so I
do not know if this resolves this splat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50131 | tracing: Consider the NULL character when validating the event length</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50131</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

up to the limit.

more than 128 fetchargs.

drm/xe/oa: Fix overflow in oa batch buffer

By default xe_bb_create_job() appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END to batch
buffer, this is not a problem if batch buffer is only used once but
oa reuses the batch buffer for the same metric and at each call
it appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END, printing the warning below and then
overflowing.

thermal: intel: int340x: processor: Fix warning during module unload

The processor_thermal driver uses pcim_device_enable() to enable a PCI
device, which means the device will be automatically disabled on driver
detach.  Thus there is no need to call pci_disable_device() again on it.

With recent PCI device resource management improvements, e.g. commit
f748a07a0b64 ("PCI: Remove legacy pcim_release()"), this problem is
exposed and triggers the warining below.

sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.

Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from
netpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll
invokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It is
dedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used
while sending the packet.

In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,
leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.

Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50095 | RDMA/mad: Improve handling of timed out WRs of mad agent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.

To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of
an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned to the user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50097 | net: fec: don&amp;#x27;t save PTP state if PTP is unsupported</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: don't save PTP state if PTP is unsupported

Some platforms (such as i.MX25 and i.MX27) do not support PTP, so on
these platforms fec_ptp_init() is not called and the related members
in fep are not initialized. However, fec_ptp_save_state() is called
unconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add a
condition so that fec_ptp_save_state() is not called if PTP is not
supported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:08:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51362 | The LSC Smart Connect Indoor IP Camera V7.6.32 is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue where live camera footage can be accessed th...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51362</link><description>The LSC Smart Connect Indoor IP Camera V7.6.32 is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue where live camera footage can be accessed through the RTSP protocol on port 8554 without requiring authentication.

bpf: support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking

Use instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed
register spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through
read-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it
*and* potentially adjusting offset.

To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into
instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame
number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction
history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's
checked most frequently during backtracking.

This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of
precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known
deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of
verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.

There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files
according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).

File                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)
--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------
test_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)

Note, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to
minimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between
bpf and bpf-next trees.

Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of
instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of
relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we
already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we
added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but
also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we
don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is
present.

Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one
that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.

The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit and not in Refit itself. This issue has been addressed in release version 8.0.0 and all users are advised to upgrade.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in "dangerous" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors ("dangerous" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 21:58:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48463 | Bruno before 1.29.1 uses Electron shell.openExternal without validation (of http or https) for opening windows within the Markdown docs view...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48463</link><description>Bruno before 1.29.1 uses Electron shell.openExternal without validation (of http or https) for opening windows within the Markdown docs viewer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 21:10:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10791 | Codezips Hospital Appointment System doctorAction.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10791</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Codezips Hospital Appointment System 1.0.
