CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 18:46:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45181 | An issue was discovered in WibuKey64.sys in WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey before v6.70 and fixed in v.6.70.

An replay attacks vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW because the caches is not differentiated by message types, it is a single, shared resource for all kinds of messages, whether they are broadcast or unicast, and regardless of whether they are ciphertext or plaintext. This can result an attacker to clear the cache of its legitimate entries, there by creating an opportunity to re-inject previously captured packets.

An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked, i.e., the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45823 | FactoryTalk® Batch View™ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability via shared secrets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45823</link><description>CVE-2024-45823 IMPACT

mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req

Adding the following warning ...

  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk-&gt;pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)

... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find a
bug when running the "remove single subflow" subtest from the
mptcp_join.sh selftest.

Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the
subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the
RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this
add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have
not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.

A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached
subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by
the host receiving the RM_ADDR.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45010 | mptcp: pm: only mark &amp;#x27;subflow&amp;#x27; endp as available</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: pm: only mark 'subflow' endp as available

Adding the following warning ...

  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk-&gt;pm.local_addr_used == 0)

... before decrementing the local_addr_used counter helped to find a bug
when running the "remove single address" subtest from the mptcp_join.sh
selftests.

Removing a 'signal' endpoint will trigger the removal of all subflows
linked to this endpoint via mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow() with
rm_type == MPTCP_MIB_RMSUBFLOW. This will decrement the local_addr_used
counter, which is wrong in this case because this counter is linked to
'subflow' endpoints, and here it is a 'signal' endpoint that is being
removed.

Now, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outside
of mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow(), only for 'subflow' endpoints, and
if the ID is not 0 -- local_addr_used is not taking into account these
ones. This marking of the ID as being available, and the decrement is
done no matter if a subflow using this ID is currently available,
because the subflow could have been closed before.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45011 | char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45011</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device

Ensure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that the
driver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.

All XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint at
address 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().

On top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT
endpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced
from a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device
while probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().

A XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data
towards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This is
why setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45012 | nouveau/firmware: use dma non-coherent allocator</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45012</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()

Commit 4733b65d82bd ("nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup")
moves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() into
nvme_init_ctrl_finish(), but don't move stopping keep-alive into
nvme_uninit_ctrl(), so keep-alive work can be started and keep pending
after failing to start controller, finally use-after-free is triggered if
nvme host driver is unloaded.

This patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connection
failure is triggered, by moving stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl().

This way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started in
nvme_init_ctrl_finish().</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45014 | s390/boot: Avoid possible physmem_info segment corruption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()

For cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/active

atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().

This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in
the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in the
atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call.

Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also
use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from
the atomic_state.

netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails

There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by
commit 5845f706388a ("net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec")
that can lead to a use-after-free.

This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS
when a packet is duplicated, which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlen
to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may be
skipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointer
for some classful qdiscs like DRR.

There are two ways for the bug happen:

- If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq-&gt;enqueue() and then
  the original packet is also dropped.
- If rootq-&gt;enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc
  and the original packet is dropped.

In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets
are enqueued at the netem qdisc.

The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after
the original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45017 | net/mlx5: Fix IPsec RoCE MPV trace call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45017</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.
Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access
in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:

    if (exact != NOT_EXACT &amp;&amp;
        old-&gt;stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=
        cur-&gt;stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])
            return false;

The 'i' iterates old-&gt;allocated_stack.
If cur-&gt;allocated_stack &lt; old-&gt;allocated_stack the out-of-bound
access will happen.

To fix the issue add 'i &gt;= cur-&gt;allocated_stack' check such that if
the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,
cur-&gt;stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45021 | memcg_write_event_control(): fix a user-triggerable oops</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45021</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0

The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains
pages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e ("mm,
vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations"), if gfp_flags includes
__GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation
failed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts
(high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to
perform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.

Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is for
PMD_SIZE):

kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)
    __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)
        vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---&gt; order-9 allocation failed and fallback to order-0
            vmap_pages_range()
                vmap_pages_range_noflush()
                    __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----&gt; wrong mapping happens

We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails,
__vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore, it is
unnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore, fix this by removing
the fallback code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45023 | md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45023</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  -&gt; normal disk is not recovered, return -1
  choose_bb_rdev

choose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.

mm/hugetlb: fix hugetlb vs. core-mm PT locking

We recently made GUP's common page table walking code to also walk hugetlb
VMAs without most hugetlb special-casing, preparing for the future of
having less hugetlb-specific page table walking code in the codebase. 
Turns out that we missed one page table locking detail: page table locking
for hugetlb folios that are not mapped using a single PMD/PUD.

Assume we have hugetlb folio that spans multiple PTEs (e.g., 64 KiB
hugetlb folios on arm64 with 4 KiB base page size).  GUP, as it walks the
page tables, will perform a pte_offset_map_lock() to grab the PTE table
lock.

However, hugetlb that concurrently modifies these page tables would
actually grab the mm-&gt;page_table_lock: with USE_SPLIT_PTE_PTLOCKS, the
locks would differ.  Something similar can happen right now with hugetlb
folios that span multiple PMDs when USE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCKS.

This issue can be reproduced [1], for example triggering:

Let's make huge_pte_lockptr() effectively use the same PT locks as any
core-mm page table walker would.  Add ptep_lockptr() to obtain the PTE
page table lock using a pte pointer -- unfortunately we cannot convert
pte_lockptr() because virt_to_page() doesn't work with kmap'ed page tables
we can have with CONFIG_HIGHPTE.

Handle CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS correctly by checking in reverse order, such
that when e.g., CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS==2 with
PGDIR_SIZE==P4D_SIZE==PUD_SIZE==PMD_SIZE will work as expected.  Document
why that works.

There is one ugly case: powerpc 8xx, whereby we have an 8 MiB hugetlb
folio being mapped using two PTE page tables.  While hugetlb wants to take
the PMD table lock, core-mm would grab the PTE table lock of one of both
PTE page tables.  In such corner cases, we have to make sure that both
locks match, which is (fortunately!) currently guaranteed for 8xx as it
does not support SMP and consequently doesn't use split PT locks.

fix bitmap corruption on close_range() with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE

copy_fd_bitmaps(new, old, count) is expected to copy the first
count/BITS_PER_LONG bits from old-&gt;full_fds_bits[] and fill
the rest with zeroes.  What it does is copying enough words
(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.
That works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are
clear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word
we'd copied.

For most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has
count equal to old-&gt;max_fds, so there's no open descriptors
past count, let alone fully occupied words in -&gt;open_fds[],
which is what bits in -&gt;full_fds_bits[] correspond to.

The other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),
which is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all
opened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on
fork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below
it and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()
is safe.

Unfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that
and where we might, indeed, end up with junk in -&gt;full_fds_bits[] -
close_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with
	* descriptor table being currently shared
	* 'to' being above the current capacity of descriptor table
	* 'from' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.
In that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn
a child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,
then close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending
up with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.

The minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().
If this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but
let's try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.

* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).
* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than
bits; it's 'count' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,
so we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the
same helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count
is a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it'll generate

s390/dasd: fix error recovery leading to data corruption on ESE devices

Extent Space Efficient (ESE) or thin provisioned volumes need to be
formatted on demand during usual IO processing.

The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signal
the non existence of a proper track format.

The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases
leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set.
This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example
during a storage server warmstart.

Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by
explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.

Also remove the check for file protected since this is not a valid
ESE handling case.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45027 | usb: xhci: Check for xhci-&amp;gt;interrupters being allocated in xhci_mem_clearup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45027</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Check for xhci-&gt;interrupters being allocated in xhci_mem_clearup()

If xhci_mem_init() fails, it calls into xhci_mem_cleanup() to mop
up the damage. If it fails early enough, before xhci-&gt;interrupters
is allocated but after xhci-&gt;max_interrupters has been set, which
happens in most (all?) cases, things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup()
unconditionally derefences xhci-&gt;interrupters. With prejudice.

Gate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci-&gt;interrupters
being non-NULL.

Found while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driver
on this exact path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45028 | mmc: mmc_test: Fix NULL dereference on allocation failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe

On ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a
mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:

	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585
	...

	Call trace:
	__might_sleep
	__mutex_lock_common
	mutex_lock_nested
	acpi_subsys_runtime_resume
	rpm_resume
	tegra_i2c_xfer

The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock
&amp;amp;dev-&gt;power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,
rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on
mutexes, triggering the error.

To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,
considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45030 | igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45030</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGS

Sabrina reports that the igb driver does not cope well with large
MAX_SKB_FRAG values: setting MAX_SKB_FRAG to 45 causes payload
corruption on TX.

An easy reproducer is to run ssh to connect to the machine.  With
MAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works, with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45 it fails.  This has
been reported originally in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320

The root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take into
account properly the (possibly large) shared info size when selecting
the ring layout, and will try to fit two packets inside the same 4K
page even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.

Address the issue by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:19:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46672 | wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Handle SSID based pmksa deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46672</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If a logged-in user with reporting privileges learns how to create a specific application request, they might be able to make limited changes to the reporting configuration. This could result in a partial loss of data integrity. In Guardian/CMC instances with a reporting configuration, there could be limited Denial of Service (DoS) impacts, as the reports may not reach their intended destination, and there could also be limited information disclosure impacts. Furthermore, modifying the destination SMTP server for the reports could lead to the compromise of external credentials, as they might be sent to an unauthorized server.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 14:56:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43793 | Halo&amp;#x27;s editor has a stored XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43793</link><description>Halo is an open source website building tool.
