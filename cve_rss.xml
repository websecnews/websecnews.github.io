MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value) structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections, a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However, the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not, so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently, the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication, and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended, which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround, disable the boot record functionality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:17:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32887 | Reflected XSS in sidekiq</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32887</link><description>Sidekiq is simple, efficient background processing for Ruby. Sidekiq is reflected XSS vulnerability. The value of substr parameter is reflected in the response without any encoding, allowing an attacker to inject Javascript code into the response of the application.  An attacker could exploit it to target users of the Sidekiq Web UI. Moreover, if other applications are deployed on the same domain or website as Sidekiq, users of those applications could also be affected, leading to a broader scope of compromise. Potentially compromising their accounts, forcing the users to perform sensitive actions, stealing sensitive data, performing CORS attacks, defacement of the web application, etc. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.4.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:17:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31601 | An issue in Beijing Panabit Network Software Co., Ltd Panalog big data analysis platform v. 20240323 and before allows attackers to execute ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31601</link><description>An issue in Beijing Panabit Network Software Co., Ltd Panalog big data analysis platform v. 20240323 and before allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the exportpdf.php component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:01:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4241 | Tenda W9 formQosManageDouble_auto stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4241</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda W9 1.0.0.7(4456).
