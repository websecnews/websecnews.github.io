When the client connects to an IRC server and receives a crafted numeric reply (specifically a 001 message), the application fails to properly validate the length of the response string. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow, which may corrupt control flow structures and allow arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is triggered during automatic IRC connection handling and does not require user interaction beyond launching the game.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51825 | JeecgBoot versions from 3.4.3 up to 3.8.0 were found to contain a SQL injection vulnerability in the /jeecg-boot/online/cgreport/head/parseS...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51825</link><description>JeecgBoot versions from 3.4.3 up to 3.8.0 were found to contain a SQL injection vulnerability in the /jeecg-boot/online/cgreport/head/parseSql endpoint, which allows bypassing SQL blacklist restrictions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50691 | MCSManager 10.5.3 daemon process runs as a root account by default, and its sensitive data (including tokens and terminal content) is stored...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50691</link><description>MCSManager 10.5.3 daemon process runs as a root account by default, and its sensitive data (including tokens and terminal content) is stored in the data directory, readable by all users.

tls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA

If we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of the
same type still on the queue, we will end up merging them:
 - process_rx_list copies the non-DATA record
 - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's
   of the same type
 - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA

Just check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list
did some work.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38616 | tls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38616</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULP

TLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP socket.
This cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socket
entered before the TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standard
read API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the WARN_ON() and a buggy
early exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with real
error handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.

We already reload the anchor every time we (re)acquire the socket lock,
so the only condition we need to avoid is an out of bounds read
(not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).

If some data was read from under TLS but there's enough in the queue
we'll reload and decrypt what is most likely not a valid TLS record.
Leading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective (corrupting
a stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crash
should take place.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38617 | net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()

When packet_set_ring() releases po-&gt;bind_lock, another thread can
run packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.

This race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7
("net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()").

There too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a
po-&gt;bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released. And
the fix was similarly to temporarily set po-&gt;num to zero to keep
the socket unhooked until the lock is retaken.

The po-&gt;bind_lock in packet_set_ring and packet_notifier precede the
introduction of git history.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38618 | vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38618</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY

It is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY. This can
cause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket.
The socket returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is not
on the list of unbound sockets. Binding it will result in an extra
refcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023 (vsock: Keep
the binding until socket destruction).

Modify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible() to also prevent binding
to VMADDR_PORT_ANY.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57884 | WordPress Greenshift Plugin &amp;lt;= 12.1.1 - Broken Access Control Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57884</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in wpsoul Greenshift allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.

For example, a client can open a stream and then send WINDOW_UPDATE frames with window size increment of 0, which is illegal.
Per specification  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-window_update , the server should send a RST_STREAM frame.
The client can now open another stream and send another bad WINDOW_UPDATE, therefore causing the server to consume more resources than necessary, as this case does not exceed the max number of concurrent streams, yet the client is able to create an enormous amount of streams in a short period of time.


The attack can be performed with other conditions (for example, a DATA frame for a closed stream) that cause the server to send a RST_STREAM frame.

An authenticated administrator can inject arbitrary JavaScript payloads into the HTTP Meta Info, Footer Copyright, and Footer Version fields. These inputs are stored and subsequently rendered without proper output encoding or sanitization on public-facing pages. As a result, the injected scripts are persistently executed in the browser context of any visitor to the affected instances including both authenticated and unauthenticated users. No user interaction is required beyond visiting a page that includes the malicious content. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, unauthorized actions via session riding, or further compromise of the application through client-side attacks.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with a file upload action, and doesn't affect sites with PHP version &gt; 8. This vulnerability also requires the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. We confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary file deletion possible when installed with this plugin. Given Contact Form 7 is a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this plugin and the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension enabled is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 03:14:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12223 | Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Nutanix Prism Central</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12223</link><description>Prism Central versions prior to 2024.3.1 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting attack via the Events component, allowing an attacker to hijack a victim userâs session and perform actions in their security context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9132 | Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a cr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9132</link><description>Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

Impacted is an unknown function of the component Password Reset Handler. Executing manipulation of the argument redirectUrl can lead to open redirect. The attack may be performed from a remote location. The exploit has been published and may be used. Upgrading to version 12.1.2410.274, 12.1.2502.178 and 12.1.2506.121 is recommended to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor explains, that "[o]ur internal validation (...) confirms that the reported behavior does not exist in currently supported releases. In these tests, the redirectUrl parameter is ignored, and no malicious redirection occurs." This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:02:34 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
