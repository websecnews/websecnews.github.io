The vulnerability arises from improper input validation in the `postprocess()` function within `gradio/components/json_component.py`, where a user-controlled string is parsed as JSON. If the parsed JSON object contains a `path` key, the specified file is moved to a temporary directory, making it possible to retrieve it later via the `/file=..` endpoint. This issue is due to the `processing_utils.move_files_to_cache()` function traversing any object passed to it, looking for a dictionary with a `path` key, and then copying the specified file to a temporary directory. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read files on the remote system, posing a significant security risk.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 17:58:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5256 | Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Integer Underflow Information Disclosure Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5256</link><description>Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Integer Underflow Information Disclosure Vulnerability.

A theoretical request smuggling vulnerability exists through Envoy if a server can be tricked into adding an upgrade header into a response. Per RFC https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-6.7 a server sends 101 when switching protocols. Envoy incorrectly accepts a 200 response from a server when requesting a protocol upgrade, but 200 does not indicate protocol switch. This opens up the possibility of request smuggling through Envoy if the server can be tricked into adding the upgrade header to the response.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4219 | SSRF In BeyondInsight</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4219</link><description>Prior to 23.2, it is possible to perform arbitrary Server-Side requests via HTTP-based connectors within BeyondInsight, resulting in a server-side request forgery vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4220 | Information Disclosure in BeyondInsight</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4220</link><description>Prior to 23.1, an information disclosure vulnerability exists within BeyondInsight which can allow an attacker to enumerate usernames.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28103 | Action Pack is missing security headers on non-HTML responses</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28103</link><description>Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests.

Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 14:29:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35654 | WordPress Responsive theme &amp;lt;= 5.0.3 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35654</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in CyberChimps Responsive allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Responsive: from n/a through 5.0.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 14:12:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35655 | WordPress Brave – Interactive Content plugin &amp;lt;= 0.6.8 -

the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49852 | WordPress Responsive Slick Slider WordPress plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4 - Content Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49852</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) vulnerability in Vsourz Digital Responsive Slick Slider WordPress allows Code Injection.This issue affects Responsive Slick Slider WordPress: from n/a through 1.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37052 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37052</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded scikit-learn model to run arbitrary code on an end user’s system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37053 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37053</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 1.1.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded scikit-learn model to run arbitrary code on an end user’s system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37054 | Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 0.9.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously upload...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37054</link><description>Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the MLflow platform running version 0.9.0 or newer, enabling a maliciously uploaded PyFunc model to run arbitrary code on an end user’s system when interacted with.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 12:19:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49774 | WordPress WP Photo Album Plus plugin &amp;lt;= 8.5.02.005 - IP Bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49774</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in J.N.
