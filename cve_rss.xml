Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.
A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path.
This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing.


This issue affects Apache Solr: from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:00:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45217 | Apache Solr: ConfigSets created during a backup restore command are trusted implicitly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45217</link><description>Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.

New ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command, which copy a configSet from the backup and give it a new name, are created without setting the "trusted" metadata.
ConfigSets that do not contain the flag are trusted implicitly if the metadata is missing, therefore this leads to "trusted" ConfigSets that may not have been created with an Authenticated request.
"trusted" ConfigSets are able to load custom code into classloaders, therefore the flag is supposed to only be set when the request that uploads the ConfigSet is Authenticated &amp; Authorized.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.

Users are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:00:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45219 | Apache CloudStack: Uploaded and registered templates and volumes can be used to abuse KVM-based infrastructure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45219</link><description>Account users in Apache CloudStack by default are allowed to upload and register templates for deploying instances and volumes for attaching them as data disks to their existing instances. Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.


Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. 

Additionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk.


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully."; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf "\n\n"; done
The command can also be run for the file-based primary storages; however, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.

For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info."; qemu-img info -U $file; printf "\n\n"; done</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:00:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45461 | Apache CloudStack Quota plugin: Access checks not enforced in Quota</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45461</link><description>The CloudStack Quota feature allows cloud administrators to implement a quota or usage limit system for cloud resources, and is disabled by default.

This issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.7.0 through 4.18.2.3; and from 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, where the Quota feature is enabled.




Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. Alternatively, users that do not use the Quota feature are advised to disabled the plugin by setting the global setting "quota.enable.service" to "false".</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:00:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45462 | Apache CloudStack: Incomplete session invalidation on web interface logout</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45462</link><description>The logout operation in the CloudStack web interface does not expire the user session completely which is valid until expiry by time or restart of the backend service.

Prior to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 15:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47876 | Sakai: Kernel users created with type roleview can login as a normal user</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47876</link><description>Sakai is a Collaboration and Learning Environment.

In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these "shared" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality from clients.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 14:55:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-31493 | An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Languages folder of Zoneminder up to v1.36.33 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via u...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31493</link><description>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Languages folder of Zoneminder up to v1.36.33 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted PHP file.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 14:45:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9979 | Pyo3: risk of use-after-free in `borrowed` reads from python weak references</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9979</link><description>A flaw was found in PyO3.

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have

predictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows 
attackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized 
access to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an 
(insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing 
initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively 
used as seed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 10:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9973 | SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop Report Viewing Page page sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9973</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop 1.0.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 5.1.5 allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags in the pages: "experiments.php" (show mode), "database.php" (show mode) or "search.php". It works by providing HTML code in the extended search string, which will then be displayed back to the user in the error message. This means that injected HTML will appear in a red "alert/danger" box, and be part of an error message. Due to some other security measures, it is not possible to execute arbitrary javascript from this attack. As such, this attack is deemed low impact. Users should upgrade to at least version 5.1.5 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 18:37:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46988 | Tuleap does not properly check permissions for email notifications in trackers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46988</link><description>Tuleap is a tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments.

Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.


The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI
 differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be 
considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI
 and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an 
invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may
 be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI 
is used after passing validation checks.


Details
Affected components
The vulnerable component is the HttpURI class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.


Attack overview
The HttpURI class does 
not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an
 illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password# @hostname https://github.com/hostname :port),
 then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the 
interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs 
from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a 
different host name from the illegal URI.


Attack scenario
A typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram 
below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the 
blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. 
The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname 
specified by the URI.


This attack occurs when the Validator is the org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI class and the Requester is the Browser (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/
 ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on 
the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the 
domain with the hostname vulndetector.com.



Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers 
that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a
 blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of 
authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the 
protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability 
will lead to SSRF[1] and URL Redirection[2] vulnerabilities in several cases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 15:20:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8184 | Jetty ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote() vulnerable to remote DoS attacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8184</link><description>Impact

Description
There exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote() which

can be exploited by unauthorized users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  By

repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the

server's memory.

There exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's DosFilter which can be exploited by unauthorized

users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the server using DosFilter. By repeatedly sending crafted requests,

attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.


Vulnerability details
The Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web

applications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It

helps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make

requests to the server.  The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including

request rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed

predefined thresholds.  The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory

condition.


Impact
Users of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that 
will ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not 
configured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation 
timeout.


Patches
The DoSFilter has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.
