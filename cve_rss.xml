This vulnerability exists because rate limiting does not occur for certain incoming TCP connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP connections to the server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause TCP connection resources to grow rapidly until the Cisco BroadWorks Network Server becomes unusable.
Note: To recover from this vulnerability, either Cisco BroadWorks Network Server software must be restarted or the Cisco BroadWorks Network Server node must be rebooted. For more information, see the  section of this advisory.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 15:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11243 | code-projects Online Shop Store signup.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11243</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in code-projects Online Shop Store 1.0.

This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of certain messages that are returned by the associated external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web interface of an affected server. Under certain conditions, the authentication mechanism would be bypassed and the attacker would be logged in as an administrator. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain administrative privileges on the web interface of an affected server, including the ability to access and modify every simulation and all user-created data. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid user credentials that are stored on the associated external authentication server.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 14:58:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20373 | Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE SNMP Extended ACL Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20373</link><description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform SNMP polling of an affected device, even if it is configured to deny SNMP traffic.&amp;nbsp;

This vulnerability exists because Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP, but they do allow administrators to configure extended named IPv4 ACLs that are attached to the SNMP server configuration without a warning message. This can result in no ACL being applied to the SNMP listening process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations that should be denied. The attacker has no control of the SNMP ACL configuration and would still need a valid SNMP version 2c (SNMPv2c) community string or SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) user credentials.
SNMP with IPv6 ACL configurations is not affected.

This vulnerability allows DAG authors to unintentionally or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables. Unauthorized users could access these logs, potentially exposing critical data that could be exploited to compromise the security of the Airflow deployment. In version 2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent sensitive configuration variables from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability. If you suspect that DAG authors could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 08:38:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10825 | Hide My WP Ghost – Security &amp;amp; Firewall &amp;lt;= 5.3.01 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via URL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10825</link><description>The Hide My WP Ghost – Security &amp; Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the URL in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.01 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.

Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration). GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244), such as remote username, which is used in [executing `ssh` commands](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.

This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand="echo hacked" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.

In `2.62.0`, the remote username information is being validated before being used.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52613 | A heap-based buffer under-read in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-05-12-02-01-18 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafte...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52613</link><description>A heap-based buffer under-read in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-05-12-02-01-18 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted MOV video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41209 | A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) and Code Execu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41209</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) and Code Execution via a crafted MOV video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:58:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49776 | A negative-size-param in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-04-05-01-53-02 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TS vide...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49776</link><description>A negative-size-param in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-04-05-01-53-02 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TS video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:58:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49777 | A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS), Information D...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49777</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure and Code Execution via a crafted MKV video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:58:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41206 | A stack-based buffer over-read in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Information Disclosure via a crafted...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41206</link><description>A stack-based buffer over-read in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-03-14-01-51-12 allows attackers to cause Information Disclosure via a crafted TS video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:51:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41217 | A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-05-10-02-00-45 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41217</link><description>A heap-based buffer overflow in tsMuxer version nightly-2024-05-10-02-00-45 allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted MKV video file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:51:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2017-13227 | In the autofill service, the package name that is provided by the app process is trusted inappropriately.  This could lead to information di...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-13227</link><description>In the autofill service, the package name that is provided by the app process is trusted inappropriately.  This could lead to information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.  User interaction is not needed for exploitation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:31:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48967 | Life2000 ventilator and Service PC lack sufficient audit logging capabilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48967</link><description>The ventilator and the Service PC lack sufficient audit logging capabilities to allow for detection of malicious activity and subsequent forensic examination.

These vulnerabilities are present in the application's functionality to send files to the AI module.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:41:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50826 | A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/add_content.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the title and co...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50826</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/add_content.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the title and content parameters.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50827 | A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/add_subject.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the subject_code...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50827</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/add_subject.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the subject_code parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50828 | A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/edit_department.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the d parame...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50828</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability was found in /admin/edit_department.php in kashipara E-learning Management System Project 1.0 via the d parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52371 | WordPress Global Gateway e4 plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0 - Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52371</link><description>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in DonnellC Global Gateway e4 | Payeezy Gateway.This issue affects Global Gateway e4 | Payeezy Gateway: from n/a through 2.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52393 | WordPress Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin &amp;lt;= 4.1.15 - Admin+ Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52393</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine vulnerability in Podlove Podlove Podcast Publisher.This issue affects Podlove Podcast Publisher: from n/a through 4.1.15.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52396 | WordPress WOLF plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.8.3 - CSV Limited Path Traversal vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52396</link><description>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability in realmag777 WOLF allows Path Traversal.This issue affects WOLF: from n/a through 1.0.8.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:30:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52524 | ReDoS in Giskard Scan text perturbation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52524</link><description>Giskard is an evaluation and testing framework for AI systems.

CVE-2023-2455 and CVE-2016-2193 fixed most interaction between row security and user ID changes.  They missed cases where a subquery, WITH query, security invoker view, or SQL-language function references a table with a row-level security policy.  This has the same consequences as the two earlier CVEs.  That is to say, it leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles.  This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.  Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications.  This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.  An attacker must tailor an attack to a particular application's pattern of query plan reuse, user ID changes, and role-specific row security policies.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:31:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10977 | PostgreSQL libpq retains an error message from man-in-the-middle</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10977</link><description>Client use of server error message in PostgreSQL allows a server not trusted under current SSL or GSS settings to furnish arbitrary non-NUL bytes to the libpq application.  For example, a man-in-the-middle attacker could send a long error message that a human or screen-scraper user of psql mistakes for valid query results.  This is probably not a concern for clients where the user interface unambiguously indicates the boundary between one error message and other text.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10978 | PostgreSQL SET ROLE, SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION reset to wrong user ID</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10978</link><description>Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE, SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises when an application query uses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker.  If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID, it may modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concern here, because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes for unvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10979 | PostgreSQL PL/Perl environment variable changes execute arbitrary code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10979</link><description>Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged database user to change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH).
