The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`""`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 16:26:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6253 | itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System purchase.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6253</link><description>A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Online Food Ordering System 1.0 and classified as critical.

This issue affects Apache Allura: from 1.4.0 through 1.17.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.17.1, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 09:23:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3593 | UberMenu &amp;lt;= 3.8.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Reset</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3593</link><description>The UberMenu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ubermenu_delete_all_item_settings and ubermenu_reset_settings functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete and reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:57:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5596 | ARMember Premium &amp;lt;= 6.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via multiple functions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5596</link><description>The ARMember Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This is due to incorrectly implemented nonce validation function on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify, or delete user meta and plugin options which can lead to limited privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:57:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4940 | Open Redirect in gradio-app/gradio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4940</link><description>An open redirect vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:37:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21514 | This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 0.0.0.

An SQL Injection issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:27:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21515 | This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 4.0.0.0.

A reflected XSS issue was identified in the filename parameter of the admin tool/log route. An attacker could obtain a user's token by tricking the user to click on a maliciously crafted URL. The user is then prompted to login and redirected again upon authentication with the payload automatically executing. If the attacked user has admin privileges, this vulnerability could be used as the start of a chain of exploits like Zip Slip or arbitrary file write vulnerabilities in the admin functionality.&#13;&#13;**Notes:**&#13;&#13;1) This is only exploitable if the attacker knows the name or path of the admin directory. The name of the directory is "admin" by default but there is a pop-up in the dashboard warning users to rename it.&#13;&#13;2) The fix for this vulnerability is incomplete.
