On Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this to .\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \??\b. Join will now convert this to \.\??\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:35:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45284 | Incorrect detection of reserved device names on Windows in path/filepath</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45284</link><description>On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device names in some cases.

An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).

This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.

It is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.

If it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See  https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/  for instructions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:29:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47613 | A CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, Telit Ci...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47613</link><description>A CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion ELS61/81, Telit Cinterion PLS62 that could allow a local, low privileged attacker to escape from virtual directories and get read/write access to protected files on the targeted system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 06:40:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47489 | An issue in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the export-v2.php and aja...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47489</link><description>An issue in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the export-v2.php and ajax.render.php components.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:36:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47488 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted scr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47488</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the attrib_manager_id parameter in the General Information page and the id parameter in the contact page.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46492 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in MLDB.ai v.2017.04.17.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46492</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in MLDB.ai v.2017.04.17.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the public_html/doc/index.html.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26156 | Versions of the package chromedriver before 119.0.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection when setting the chromedriver.path to an arbitrary s...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26156</link><description>Versions of the package chromedriver before 119.0.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection when setting the chromedriver.path to an arbitrary system binary.

The Fides web application allows data subject users to request access to their personal data. If the request is approved by the data controller user operating the Fides web application, the data subject's personal data can then retrieved from connected systems and data stores before being bundled together as a data subject access request package for the data subject to download. Supported data formats for the package include json and csv, but the most commonly used format is a series of HTML files compressed in a ZIP file. Once downloaded and unzipped, the data subject user can browse the HTML files on their local machine. It was identified that there was no validation of input coming from e.g. the connected systems and data stores which is later reflected in the downloaded data. This can result in an HTML injection that can be abused e.g. for phishing attacks or malicious JavaScript code execution, but only in the context of the data subject's browser accessing a HTML page using the `file://` protocol. Exploitation is limited to rogue Admin UI users, malicious connected system / data store users, and the data subject user if tricked via social engineering into submitting malicious data themselves. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.23.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47111 | ZITADEL race condition in lockout policy execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47111</link><description>ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. ZITADEL provides administrators the possibility to define a `Lockout Policy` with a maximum amount of failed password check attempts. On every failed password check, the amount of failed checks is compared against the configured maximum. Exceeding the limit, will lock the user and prevent further authentication. In the affected implementation it was possible for an attacker to start multiple parallel password checks, giving him the possibility to try out more combinations than configured in the `Lockout Policy`. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.40.5 and 2.38.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:50:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47109 | PrestaShop blockreassurance BO User can remove any file from server when adding a and deleting a block</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47109</link><description>PrestaShop blockreassurance adds an information block aimed at offering helpful information to reassure customers that the store is trustworthy.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.5.0, which fixes the issue.

There are several locations in the code where serialized Java objects are deserialized without verifying the data. This affects in particular:
  *  the deserialization of a Java-serialized CAS, but also other binary CAS formats that include TSI information using the CasIOUtils class;
  *  the CAS Editor Eclipse plugin which uses the the CasIOUtils class to load data;
  *  the deserialization of a Java-serialized CAS of the Vinci Analysis Engine service which can receive using Java-serialized CAS objects over network connections;
  *  the CasAnnotationViewerApplet and the CasTreeViewerApplet;
  *  the checkpointing feature of the CPE module.

Note that the UIMA framework by default does not start any remotely accessible services (i.e. Vinci) that would be vulnerable to this issue. A user or developer would need to make an active choice to start such a service. However, users or developers may use the CasIOUtils in their own applications and services to parse serialized CAS data. They are affected by this issue unless they ensure that the data passed to CasIOUtils is not a serialized Java object.

When using Vinci or using CasIOUtils in own services/applications, the unrestricted deserialization of Java-serialized CAS files may allow arbitrary (remote) code execution.

As a remedy, it is possible to set up a global or context-specific ObjectInputFilter (cf.  https://openjdk.org/jeps/290  and  https://openjdk.org/jeps/415 ) if running UIMA on a Java version that supports it. 

Note that Java 1.8 does not support the ObjectInputFilter, so there is no remedy when running on this out-of-support platform. An upgrade to a recent Java version is strongly recommended if you need to secure an UIMA version that is affected by this issue.

To mitigate the issue on a Java 9+ platform, you can configure a filter pattern through the "jdk.serialFilter" system property using a semicolon as a separator:

To allow deserializing Java-serialized binary CASes, add the classes:
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASCompleteSerializer
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASMgrSerializer
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASSerializer
  *  java.lang.String

To allow deserializing CPE Checkpoint data, add the following classes (and any custom classes your application uses to store its checkpoints):
  *  org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.CheckpointData
  *  org.apache.uima.util.ProcessTrace
  *  org.apache.uima.util.impl.ProcessTrace_impl
  *  org.apache.uima.collection.base_cpm.SynchPoint

Make sure to use "!*" as the final component to the filter pattern to disallow deserialization of any classes not listed in the pattern.

Apache UIMA 3.5.0 uses tightly scoped ObjectInputFilters when reading Java-serialized data depending on the type of data being expected. Configuring a global filter is not necessary with this version.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46483 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in timetec AWDMS v.2.0 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the re...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46483</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in timetec AWDMS v.2.0 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the remark parameter of the New Zone function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41111 | An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, Automotive Processor, and Modem (Exynos 9810, 9610, 9820, 980, 850,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41111</link><description>An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, Automotive Processor, and Modem (Exynos 9810, 9610, 9820, 980, 850, 1080, 2100, 2200, 1280, 1380, 1330, 9110, W920, Modem 5123, Modem 5300, and Auto T5123).

Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 19:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4956 | Clickjacking on config-editor page severity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4956</link><description>A flaw was found in Quay.

Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar, SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 19:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46253 | Remote code execution in Squidex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46253</link><description>Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions are subject to an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the backup restore feature which allows an authenticated attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE). Squidex allows users with the `squidex.admin.restore` permission to create and restore backups. Part of these backups are the assets uploaded to an App. For each asset, the backup zip archive contains a `.asset` file with the actual content of the asset as well as a related `AssetCreatedEventV2` event, which is stored in a JSON file. Amongst other things, the JSON file contains the event type (`AssetCreatedEventV2`), the ID of the asset (`46c05041-9588-4179-b5eb-ddfcd9463e1e`), its filename (`test.txt`), and its file version (`0`). When a backup with this event is restored, the `BackupAssets.ReadAssetAsync` method is responsible for re-creating the asset. For this purpose, it determines the name of the `.asset` file in the zip archive, reads its content, and stores the content in the filestore. When the asset is stored in the filestore via the UploadAsync method, the assetId and fileVersion are passed as arguments. These are further passed to the method GetFileName, which determines the filename where the asset should be stored. The assetId is inserted into the filename without any sanitization and an attacker with squidex.admin.restore privileges to run arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying server (RCE).</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 19:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5998 | Out-of-bounds Read in gpac/gpac</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5998</link><description>Out-of-bounds Read in GitHub repository gpac/gpac prior to 2.3.0-DEV.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 18:50:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-28499 | WordPress Slide Anything Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.4.9 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28499</link><description>Auth.

The root cause is that Cosign loops through all attestations fetched from the remote registry in pkg/cosign.FetchAttestations. The attacker needs to compromise the registry or make a request to a registry they control. When doing so, the attacker must return a high number of attestations in the response to Cosign. The result will be that the attacker can cause Cosign to go into a long or infinite loop that will prevent other users from verifying their data. In Kyvernos case, an attacker whose privileges are limited to making requests to the cluster can make a request with an image reference to their own registry, trigger the infinite loop and deny other users from completing their admission requests. Alternatively, the attacker can obtain control of the registry used by an organization and return a high number of attestations instead the expected number of attestations. The issue can be mitigated rather simply by setting a limit to the limit of attestations that Cosign will loop through. The limit does not need to be high to be within the vast majority of use cases and still prevent the endless data attack. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.1 and users are advised to upgrade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:37:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-41616 | WordPress Export Users Data CSV Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41616</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Kaushik Kalathiya Export Users Data CSV.This issue affects Export Users Data CSV: from n/a through 2.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-47181 | WordPress Email Templates Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4.2 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-47181</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wpexpertsio Email Templates Customizer and Designer for WordPress and WooCommerce email-templates allows Cross Site Request Forgery.This issue affects Email Templates Customizer and Designer for WordPress and WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.4.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41798 | WordPress Directorist Plugin &amp;lt;= 7.7.1 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41798</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in wpWax Directorist – WordPress Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listing.This issue affects Directorist – WordPress Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings: from n/a through 7.7.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46744 | Stored Cross-site Scripting in Squidex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46744</link><description>Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. In affected versions a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability enables privilege escalation of authenticated users. The SVG element filtering mechanism intended to stop XSS attacks through uploaded SVG images, is insufficient resulting to stored XSS attacks. Squidex allows the CMS contributors to be granted the permission of uploading an SVG asset. When the asset is uploaded, a filtering mechanism is performed to validate that the SVG does not contain malicious code. The validation logic consists of traversing the HTML nodes in the DOM. In order for the validation to succeed, 2 conditions must be met: 1. No HTML tags included in a "blacklist" called "InvalidSvgElements" are present. This list only contains the element "script". and 2. No attributes of HTML tags begin with "on" (i.e. onerror, onclick) (line 65). If either of the 2 conditions is not satisfied, validation fails and the file/asset is not uploaded. However it is possible to bypass the above filtering mechanism and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by introducing other HTML elements such as an &lt;iframe&gt; element with a "src" attribute containing a "javascript:" value. Authenticated adversaries with the "assets.create" permission, can leverage this vulnerability to upload a malicious SVG as an asset, targeting any registered user that will attempt to open/view the asset through the Squidex CMS.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-38702 | WordPress WP CSV Exporter Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.0 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-38702</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Nakashima Masahiro WP CSV Exporter.This issue affects WP CSV Exporter: from n/a through 2.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:26:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-42882 | WordPress Simple CSV/XLS Exporter Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.5.8 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-42882</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Shambix Simple CSV/XLS Exporter.This issue affects Simple CSV/XLS Exporter: from n/a through 1.5.8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-44738 | WordPress Posts and Users Stats Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.1.3 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-44738</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Patrick Robrecht Posts and Users Stats.This issue affects Posts and Users Stats: from n/a through 1.1.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46501 | An issue in BoltWire v.6.03 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the view and change admin pass...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46501</link><description>An issue in BoltWire v.6.03 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the view and change admin password function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-45078 | WordPress User Blocker Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.5.5 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-45078</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Solwin Infotech User Blocker.This issue affects User Blocker: from n/a through 1.5.5.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:27:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-45360 | WordPress Commenter Emails Plugin &amp;lt;= 2.6.1 is vulnerable to CSV Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-45360</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerability in Scott Reilly Commenter Emails.This issue affects Commenter Emails: from n/a through 2.6.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:27:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-45370 | WordPress WordPress Comments Import &amp;amp;
