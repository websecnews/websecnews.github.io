HotCRP versions from October 2025 through January 2026 delivered documents of all types with inline Content-Disposition, causing them to be rendered in the user’s browser rather than downloaded. (The intended behavior was for only `text/plain`, `application/pdf`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/png` to be delivered inline, though adding `save=0` to the document URL could request inline delivery for any document.) This made users who clicked a document link vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. An uploaded HTML or SVG document would run in the viewer’s browser with access to their HotCRP credentials, and Javascript in that document could eventually make arbitrary calls to HotCRP’s API. Malicious documents could be uploaded to submission fields with “file upload” or “attachment” type, or as attachments to comments. PDF upload fields were not vulnerable. A search of documents uploaded to hotcrp.com found no evidence of exploitation. The vulnerability was introduced in commit aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508 (11 October 2025), present in development versions and v3.2, and fixed in commit 8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323 and v3.2.1. Additionally, c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5 and v3.2.1 remove support for `save=0`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:36:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25154 | LocalSend has Stored XSS in Web Share Interface via Filename</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25154</link><description>LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows users to share files and messages with nearby devices over their local network without needing an internet connection. In versions up to and including 1.17.0, when a user initiates a "Share via Link" session, the LocalSend application starts a local HTTP server to host the selected files. The client-side logic for this web interface is contained in `app/assets/web/main.js`. Note that at [0], the `handleFilesDisplay` function constructs the HTML for the file list by iterating over the files received from the server. Commit 8f3cec85aa29b2b13fed9b2f8e499e1ac9b0504c contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:36:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25152 | @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node vulnerable to possible Path Traversal in TechDocs Local Generator</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25152</link><description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node provides common node.js functionalities for TechDocs. In versions of @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node prior to 1.13.11 and 1.14.1, a path traversal vulnerability in the TechDocs local generator allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the host filesystem when Backstage is configured with `techdocs.generator.runIn: local`. When processing documentation from untrusted sources, symlinks within the docs directory are followed by MkDocs during the build process. File contents are embedded into generated HTML and exposed to users who can view the documentation. This vulnerability is fixed in` @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` versions 1.13.11 and 1.14.1. Some workarounds are available. Switch to `runIn: docker` in `app-config.yaml` and/or restrict write access to TechDocs source repositories to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:00:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2668 | IBM Db2 Denial of Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2668</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) 11.5.0 -

In versions of @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node prior to 1.13.11 and 1.14.1, when TechDocs is configured with `runIn: local`, a malicious actor who can submit or modify a repository's `mkdocs.yml` file can execute arbitrary Python code on the TechDocs build server via MkDocs hooks configuration. @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node versions 1.13.11 and 1.14.1 contain a fix. The fix introduces an allowlist of supported MkDocs configuration keys. Unsupported configuration keys (including `hooks`) are now removed from `mkdocs.yml` before running the generator, with a warning logged to indicate which keys were removed. Users of `@techdocs/cli` should also upgrade to the latest version, which includes the fixed `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` dependency. Some workarounds are available. Configure TechDocs with `runIn: docker` instead of `runIn: local` to provide container isolation, though it does not fully mitigate the risk. Limit who can modify `mkdocs.yml` files in repositories that TechDocs processes; only allow trusted contributors. Implement PR review requirements for changes to `mkdocs.yml` files to detect malicious `hooks` configurations before they are merged. Use MkDocs &lt; 1.4.0 (e.g., 1.3.1) which does not support hooks. Note: This may limit access to newer MkDocs features. Building documentation in CI/CD pipelines using `@techdocs/cli` does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the CLI uses the same vulnerable `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` package.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:52:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36442 | IBM Db2 Denial of Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-36442</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) is vulnerable to a denial of service as the server may crash under certain conditions with a specially crafted query with XML columns.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:34:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1723 | TOTOLINK X6000R Unauthenticated Command Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1723</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in TOTOLINK X6000R allows OS Command Injection.This issue affects X6000R: through V9.4.0cu.1498_B20250826.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24293 | # Active Storage allowed transformation methods potentially unsafe&#13;
&#13;
Active Storage attempts to prevent the use of potentially unsafe image...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24293</link><description># Active Storage allowed transformation methods potentially unsafe

Active Storage attempts to prevent the use of potentially unsafe image
transformation methods and parameters by default.

The default allowed list contains three methods allow for the circumvention
of the safe defaults which enables potential command injection
vulnerabilities in cases where arbitrary user supplied input is accepted as
valid transformation methods or parameters.


Impact
------
This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage with the image_processing processing gem in addition to mini_magick as the image processor.

Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:
```
&lt;%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] =&gt; params[:v]) %&gt;
```

Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary input.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.



Workarounds
-----------
Consuming user supplied input for image transformation methods or their parameters is unsupported behavior and should be considered dangerous.

Strict validation of user supplied methods and parameters should be performed
as well as having a strong [ImageMagick security
policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php) deployed.

Prior to versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19, PsySH automatically loads and executes a `.psysh.php` file from the Current Working Directory (CWD) on startup. If an attacker can write to a directory that a victim later uses as their CWD when launching PsySH, the attacker can trigger arbitrary code execution in the victim's context. When the victim runs PsySH with elevated privileges (e.g., root), this results in local privilege escalation. This is a CWD configuration poisoning issue leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim user’s context. If a privileged user (e.g., root, a CI runner, or an ops/debug account) launches PsySH with CWD set to an attacker-writable directory containing a malicious `.psysh.php`, the attacker can execute commands with that privileged user’s permissions, resulting in local privilege escalation. Downstream consumers that embed PsySH inherit this risk. For example, Laravel Tinker (`php artisan tinker`) uses PsySH. If a privileged user runs Tinker while their shell is in an attacker-writable directory, the `.psysh.php` auto-load behavior can be abused in the same way to execute attacker-controlled code under the victim’s privileges. Versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19 patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25130 | Cybersecurity AI vulnerable to command Injection through argument injection in find_file Agent tool</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25130</link><description>Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is a framework for AI Security. In versions up to and including 0.5.10, the CAI (Cybersecurity AI) framework contains multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in its function tools. User-controlled input is passed directly to shell commands via `subprocess.Popen()` with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The `find_file()` tool executes without requiring user approval because find is considered a "safe" pre-approved command. This means an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious arguments (like -exec) into the args parameter, completely bypassing any human-in-the-loop safety mechanisms. Commit e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde contains a fix.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25141 | Orval has a code injection via unsanitized x-enum-descriptions uing JS comments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25141</link><description>Orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification. Versions starting with 7.19.0 and prior to 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 have an incomplete fix for CVE-2026-23947. While the jsStringEscape function properly handles single quotes ('), double quotes (") and so on, it is still possible to achieve code injection using only a limited set of characters that are currently not escaped. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application can be forced to execute arbitrary JavaScript using characters such as []()!+. By using a technique known as JSFuck, an attacker can bypass the current sanitization logic and run arbitrary code without needing any alphanumeric characters or quotes. Version 7.21.0 and 8.2.0 contain an updated fix.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23835 | LobeHub Vulnerable to Improper Authorization in Presigned Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23835</link><description>LobeHub is an open source human-and-AI-agent network. Prior to version 1.143.3, the file upload feature in `Knowledge Base &gt; File Upload` does not validate the integrity of the upload request, allowing users to intercept and modify the request parameters. As a result, it is possible to create arbitrary files in abnormal or unintended paths. In addition, since `lobechat.com` relies on the size parameter from the request to calculate file usage, an attacker can manipulate this value to misrepresent the actual file size, such as uploading a `1 GB` file while reporting it as `10 MB`, or falsely declaring a `10 MB` file as a `1 GB` file. By manipulating the size value provided in the client upload request, it is possible to bypass the monthly upload quota enforced by the server and continuously upload files beyond the intended storage and traffic limits. This abuse can result in a discrepancy between actual resource consumption and billing calculations, causing direct financial impact to the service operator. Additionally, exhaustion of storage or related resources may lead to degraded service availability, including failed uploads, delayed content delivery, or temporary suspension of upload functionality for legitimate users. A single malicious user can also negatively affect other users or projects sharing the same subscription plan, effectively causing an indirect denial of service (DoS). Furthermore, excessive and unaccounted-for uploads can distort monitoring metrics and overload downstream systems such as backup processes, malware scanning, and media processing pipelines, ultimately undermining overall operational stability and service reliability. Version 1.143.3 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11175 | DiscussionTools should use better regex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11175</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') vulnerability in The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - DiscussionTools Extension allows Regular Expression Exponential Blowup.This issue affects Mediawiki - DiscussionTools Extension: 1.44, 1.43.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62348 | Salt junos module uses an unsafe YAML loader which may allow unintended code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62348</link><description>Salt's junos execution module contained an unsafe YAML decode/load usage.

Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15, the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body’s `direction` value without runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send arbitrary strings (e.g., `"x"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`"up"` and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can be exploited to bypass intended business logic.

The `ig` binary provides a subcommand for image building, used to generate custom gadget OCI images. A part of this functionality is implemented in the file `inspektor-gadget/cmd/common/image/build.go`. The `Makefile.build` file is the Makefile template employed during the building process. This file includes user-controlled data in an unsafe fashion, specifically some parameters are embedded without an adequate escaping in the commands inside the Makefile. Prior to version 0.48.1, this implementation is vulnerable to command injection: an attacker able to control values in the `buildOptions` structure would be able to execute arbitrary commands during the building process. An attacker able to exploit this vulnerability would be able to execute arbitrary command on the Linux host where the `ig` command is launched, if images are built with the `--local` flag or on the build container invoked by `ig`, if the `--local` flag is not provided. The `buildOptions` structure is extracted from the YAML gadget manifest passed to the `ig image build` command. Therefore, the attacker would need a way to control either the full `build.yml` file passed to the `ig image build` command, or one of its options. Typically, this could happen in a CI/CD scenario that builds untrusted gadgets to verify correctness. Version 0.48.1 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25040 | Budibase Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via API Abuse – Creator Can Invite Users with Admin/Any Role</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25040</link><description>Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin panels.

The published VSCode extension does not include these files and end users are not affected. This is fixed in version 0.1.6 by replacing execSync with execFileSync using array arguments.

A command injection vulnerability was found in gradle-completion up to and including 9.3.0 that allows arbitrary code execution when a user triggers Bash tab completion in a project containing a malicious Gradle build file. The `gradle-completion` script for Bash fails to adequately sanitize Gradle task names and task descriptions, allowing command injection via a malicious Gradle build file when the user completes a command in Bash (without them explicitly running any task in the build). For example, given a task description that includes a string between backticks, then that string would be evaluated as a command when presenting the task description in the completion list. While task execution is the core feature of Gradle, this inherent execution may lead to unexpected outcomes. The vulnerability does not affect zsh completion. The first patched version is 9.3.1. As a workaround, it is possible and effective to temporarily disable bash completion for Gradle by removing `gradle-completion` from `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:01:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24902 | TrustTunnel has SSRF and private network restriction bypass via numeric address destinations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24902</link><description>TrustTunnel is an open-source VPN protocol with a server-side request forgery and and private network restriction bypass in versions prior to 0.9.114.

The `TcpDestination::Address(peer) =&gt; peer` path proceeded to `TcpStream::connect()` without equivalent checks (for example `is_global_ip`, `is_loopback`), allowing loopback/private targets to be reached by supplying a numeric IP.

In `tls_listener.rs`, `TlsListener::listen()` peeks 1024 bytes and calls `extract_client_random(...)`. If `parse_tls_plaintext` fails (for example, a fragmented/partial ClientHello split across TCP writes), `extract_client_random` returns `None`. In `rules.rs`, `RulesEngine::evaluate` only evaluates `client_random_prefix` when `client_random` is `Some(...)`. As a result, when extraction fails (`client_random == None`), any rule that relies on `client_random_prefix` matching is skipped and evaluation falls through to later rules. As an important semantics note: `client_random_prefix` is a match condition only. It does not mean "block non-matching prefixes" by itself. A rule with `client_random_prefix = ...` triggers its `action` only when the prefix matches (and the field is available to evaluate). Non-matches (or `None`) simply do not match that rule and continue to fall through. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.115.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:46:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24845 | malcontent&amp;#x27;s OCI image scanning could expose registry credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24845</link><description>malcontent discovers supply-chain compromises through. context, differential analysis, and YARA.

In versions prior to 3.26.0, when a container image is malformed or contains no layers, containerd falls back to bind-mounting an empty snapshotter directory for the container rootfs. When the Kata runtime attempts to mount the container rootfs, the bind mount causes the rootfs to be detected as a block device, leading to the underlying device being hotplugged to the guest. This can cause filesystem-level errors on the host due to double inode allocation, and may lead to the host's block device being mounted as read-only. Version 3.26.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:37:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-24413 | Icinga has insecure permission of %ProgramData%\icinga2\var on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24413</link><description>Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system.

In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend).
