It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5517 | Querying RFC 1918 reverse zones may cause an assertion failure when &amp;quot;nxdomain-redirect&amp;quot; is enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5517</link><description>A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when:

  - `nxdomain-redirect &lt;domain&gt;;` is configured, and
  - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918 address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.12.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5679 | Enabling both DNS64 and serve-stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5679</link><description>A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale may cause `named` to crash with an assertion failure during recursive resolution, when both of these features are enabled.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5680 | Cleaning an ECS-enabled cache may cause excessive CPU load</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5680</link><description>If a resolver cache has a very large number of ECS records stored for the same name, the process of cleaning the cache database node for this name can significantly impair query performance. 
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6516 | Specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out-of-memory condition</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6516</link><description>To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24781 | Hima: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in multiple products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24781</link><description>An unauthenticated remote attacker can use an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability to DoS the affected devices through excessive traffic on a single ethernet port.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 13:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24782 | HIMA: Origin Validation Error in multiple products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24782</link><description>An unauthenticated attacker can send a ping request from one network to another through an error in the origin verification even though the ports are separated by VLAN.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 13:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1309 | Resource Consumption Identified in NTP before 4.2.4p8 and 4.2.5</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1309</link><description>Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Honeywell Niagara Framework on Windows, Linux, QNX allows Content Spoofing.This issue affects Niagara Framework: before Niagara AX 3.8.1, before Niagara 4.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 13:46:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6072 | A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Trellix Central Management (CM) prior to 9.1.3.97129 allows a remote authenticated attacker to craft...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6072</link><description>A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Trellix Central Management (CM) prior to 9.1.3.97129 allows a remote authenticated attacker to craft CM dashboard internal requests causing arbitrary content to be injected into the response when accessing the CM dashboard.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:44:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1157 | The Bold Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's button URL in all versions up to, a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1157</link><description>The Bold Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's button URL in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version&lt;=3.7.7) where an attacker may construct a JDBC query which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server.

When processing requests authorization was improperly and insufficiently checked, allowing attackers to access far more functionality than users intended, including to the administrative and moderator functionality of the Pixelfed server. This vulnerability affects every version of Pixelfed between v0.10.4 and v0.11.9, inclusive. A proof of concept of this vulnerability exists. This vulnerability affects every local user of a Pixelfed server, and can potentially affect the servers' ability to federate. Some user interaction is required to setup the conditions to be able to exercise the vulnerability, but the attacker could conduct this attack time-delayed manner, where user interaction is not actively required. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.11.11. Users are advised to upgrade.
