Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48063 | XWiki Platform Security Authorization Bridge allows users with just edit right can enforce required rights with programming right</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48063</link><description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4 and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48064 | GitHub Desktop vulnerable to maliciously crafted file renames leading to information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48064</link><description>GitHub Desktop is an open-source, Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. Prior to version 3.4.20-beta3, an attacker convincing a user to view a file in a commit of their making in the history view can cause information disclosure by means of Git attempting to access a network share. This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash. GitHub Desktop 3.4.20 and later fix this vulnerability. The beta channel includes the fix in 3.4.20-beta3. As a workaround to use until upgrading is possible, only browse commits in the history view that comes from trusted sources.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46822 | Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via Absolute Path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46822</link><description>OsamaTaher/Java-springboot-codebase is a collection of Java and Spring Boot code snippets, applications, and projects.

A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where containerd, starting in version 2.0.1 and prior to version 2.0.5, doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy, therefore some Kubernetes limits are not honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node. This bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, disable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:43:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48060 | AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow in jq_fuzz_execute (jv_string_vfmt)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48060</link><description>jq is a command-line JSON processor.

No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47850 | In JetBrains YouTrack before 2025.1.74704 restricted attachments could become visible after issue cloning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47850</link><description>In JetBrains YouTrack before 2025.1.74704 restricted attachments could become visible after issue cloning</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47851 | In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via GitHub Checks Webhook was possible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47851</link><description>In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via GitHub Checks Webhook was possible</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47852 | In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via YouTrack integration was possible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47852</link><description>In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via YouTrack integration was possible</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47853 | In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via Jira integration was possible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47853</link><description>In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 stored XSS via Jira integration was possible</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47854 | In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 open redirect was possible on editing VCS Root page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47854</link><description>In JetBrains TeamCity before 2025.03.2 open redirect was possible on editing VCS Root page</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48391 | In JetBrains YouTrack before 2025.1.76253 deletion of issues was possible due to missing permission checks in API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48391</link><description>In JetBrains YouTrack before 2025.1.76253 deletion of issues was possible due to missing permission checks in API</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:43:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46724 | Langroid has a Code Injection vulnerability in TableChatAgent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46724</link><description>Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications.

crypto: ecdsa - Harden against integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP()

Herbert notes that DIV_ROUND_UP() may overflow unnecessarily if an ecdsa
implementation's -&gt;key_size() callback returns an unusually large value.
Herbert instead suggests (for a division by 8):

  X / 8 + !!(X &amp; 7)

Based on this formula, introduce a generic DIV_ROUND_UP_POW2() macro and
use it in lieu of DIV_ROUND_UP() for -&gt;key_size() return values.

Additionally, use the macro in ecc_digits_from_bytes(), whose "nbytes"
parameter is a -&gt;key_size() return value in some instances, or a
user-specified ASN.1 length in the case of ecdsa_get_signature_rs().</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:31:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37985 | USB: wdm: close race between wdm_open and wdm_wwan_port_stop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37985</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition

The pds_core's adminq is protected by the adminq_lock, which prevents
more than 1 command to be posted onto it at any one time. This makes it
so the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.
However, the completions happen in a different context, which means
multiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting
on completion.

On the FW side, the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries
long and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is
lacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck, so commands are no
longer processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.

As an initial fix, prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so
there's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works
because the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16
pending adminq commands, so it will never overflow. This is done by
reducing the adminq depth to 16.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:31:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37988 | fix a couple of races in MNT_TREE_BENEATH handling by do_move_mount()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37988</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fix a couple of races in MNT_TREE_BENEATH handling by do_move_mount()

Normally do_lock_mount(path, _) is locking a mountpoint pinned by
*path and at the time when matching unlock_mount() unlocks that
location it is still pinned by the same thing.

Unfortunately, for 'beneath' case it's no longer that simple -
the object being locked is not the one *path points to.  It's the
mountpoint of path-&gt;mnt.  The thing is, without sufficient locking
-&gt;mnt_parent may change under us and none of the locks are held
at that point.  The rules are
	* mount_lock stabilizes m-&gt;mnt_parent for any mount m.
	* namespace_sem stabilizes m-&gt;mnt_parent, provided that
m is mounted.
	* if either of the above holds and refcount of m is positive,
we are guaranteed the same for refcount of m-&gt;mnt_parent.

namespace_sem nests inside inode_lock(), so do_lock_mount() has
to take inode_lock() before grabbing namespace_sem.  It does
recheck that path-&gt;mnt is still mounted in the same place after
getting namespace_sem, and it does take care to pin the dentry.
It is needed, since otherwise we might end up with racing mount --move
(or umount) happening while we were getting locks; in that case
dentry would no longer be a mountpoint and could've been evicted
on memory pressure along with its inode - not something you want
when grabbing lock on that inode.

However, pinning a dentry is not enough - the matching mount is
also pinned only by the fact that path-&gt;mnt is mounted on top it
and at that point we are not holding any locks whatsoever, so
the same kind of races could end up with all references to
that mount gone just as we are about to enter inode_lock().
If that happens, we are left with filesystem being shut down while
we are holding a dentry reference on it; results are not pretty.

What we need to do is grab both dentry and mount at the same time;
that makes inode_lock() safe *and* avoids the problem with fs getting
shut down under us.  After taking namespace_sem we verify that
path-&gt;mnt is still mounted (which stabilizes its -&gt;mnt_parent) and
check that it's still mounted at the same place.  From that point
on to the matching namespace_unlock() we are guaranteed that
mount/dentry pair we'd grabbed are also pinned by being the mountpoint
of path-&gt;mnt, so we can quietly drop both the dentry reference (as
the current code does) and mnt one - it's OK to do under namespace_sem,
since we are not dropping the final refs.

That solves the problem on do_lock_mount() side; unlock_mount()
also has one, since dentry is guaranteed to stay pinned only until
the namespace_unlock().  That's easy to fix - just have inode_unlock()
done earlier, while it's still pinned by mp-&gt;m_dentry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:31:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37989 | net: phy: leds: fix memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37989</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: leds: fix memory leak

A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition,
which was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.

The root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function
(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, not
phy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)
is called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register and
unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY
device, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is
unbound.

This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm API
internally stores the allocated pointer.

Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard
kzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister
path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:31:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37990 | wifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37990</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

a second SIGFPE in the signal handler.  Dave analyzed it, and it happens
because glibc uses a double-word floating-point store to atomically update
function descriptors. As a result of lazy binding, we hit a floating-point
store in fpe_func almost immediately.

When the T bit is set, an assist exception trap occurs when when the
co-processor encounters *any* floating-point instruction except for a double
store of register %fr0.  The latter cancels all pending traps.  Let's fix this
by clearing the Trap (T) bit in the FP status register before returning to the
signal handler in userspace.

The issue can be reproduced with this test program:

root@parisc:~# cat fpe.c

static void fpe_func(int sig, siginfo_t *i, void *v) {
        sigset_t set;
        sigemptyset(&amp;amp;set);
        sigaddset(&amp;amp;set, SIGFPE);
        sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;amp;set, NULL);
        printf("GOT signal %d with si_code %ld\n", sig, i-&gt;si_code);
}

int main() {
        struct sigaction action = {
                .sa_sigaction = fpe_func,
                .sa_flags = SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO };
        sigaction(SIGFPE, &amp;amp;action, 0);
        feenableexcept(FE_OVERFLOW);
        return printf("%lf\n",1.7976931348623158E308*1.7976931348623158E308);
}

wifi: ath12k: Fix invalid entry fetch in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process

[ Upstream commit 63fdc4509bcf483e79548de6bc08bf3c8e504bb3 ]

Currently, ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process uses ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry
to fetch the next entry from the destination ring. This is incorrect because
ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry is intended for source rings, not destination
rings. This leads to invalid entry fetches, causing potential data corruption or
crashes due to accessing incorrect memory locations. This happens because the
source ring and destination ring have different handling mechanisms and using
the wrong function results in incorrect pointer arithmetic and ring management.

To fix this issue, replace the call to ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry with
ath12k_hal_srng_dst_get_next_entry in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process. This ensures
that the correct function is used for fetching entries from the destination
ring, preventing invalid memory accesses.

true at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This

drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped

When a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progress
since the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware, we skip
the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a
chance to complete.

However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed
from the pending list, which means it won't be automatically freed through
`free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the job
running, the job won't be freed when it finally completes.

This situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].

Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 ("drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler when
GPU is still active"), this patch ensures the job is put back on the
pending list when extending the timeout.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37952 | ksmbd: Fix UAF in __close_file_table_ids</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37952</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  |-&gt; htb_next_rb_node()

For htb_next_rb_node(), after calling the 1st htb_deactivate(), the
clprio[prio]-&gt;ptr could be already set to  NULL, which means
htb_next_rb_node() is vulnerable here.

For htb_deactivate(), although we checked qlen before calling it, in
case of qlen==0 after qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog(), we may call it again
which triggers the warning inside.

To fix the issues here, we need to:

1) Make htb_deactivate() idempotent, that is, simply return if we
   already call it before.
2) Make htb_next_rb_node() safe against ptr==NULL.

Many thanks to Alan for testing and for the reproducer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37954 | smb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37954</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks

A pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir might
race with a lease break, meaning open_cached_dir doesn't consider it
valid, and thinks it's newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference
if the allocation occurs before the queued lease break work runs.

Avoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across
find_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37955 | virtio-net: free xsk_buffs on error in virtnet_xsk_pool_enable()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37955</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Forcibly leave SMM mode on SHUTDOWN interception

Previously, commit ed129ec9057f ("KVM: x86: forcibly leave nested mode
on vCPU reset") addressed an issue where a triple fault occurring in
nested mode could lead to use-after-free scenarios. However, the commit
did not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).

This omission results in triggering a WARN when KVM forces a vCPU INIT
after SHUTDOWN interception while the vCPU is in SMM. This situation was
reprodused using Syzkaller by:

  1) Creating a KVM VM and vCPU
  2) Sending a KVM_SMI ioctl to explicitly enter SMM
  3) Executing invalid instructions causing consecutive exceptions and
     eventually a triple fault

The issue manifests as follows:

Architecturally, INIT is blocked when the CPU is in SMM, hence KVM's WARN()
in kvm_vcpu_reset() to guard against KVM bugs, e.g. to detect improper
emulation of INIT.  SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to
do _something_ sane with the VMCB, since it's technically undefined, and
INIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.

So, double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN, and force the vCPU out of
SMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

mm/huge_memory: fix dereferencing invalid pmd migration entry

When migrating a THP, concurrent access to the PMD migration entry during
a deferred split scan can lead to an invalid address access, as
illustrated below.  To prevent this invalid access, it is necessary to
check the PMD migration entry and return early.  In this context, there is
no need to use pmd_to_swp_entry and pfn_swap_entry_to_page to verify the
equality of the target folio.  Since the PMD migration entry is locked, it
cannot be served as the target.

Mailing list discussion and explanation from Hugh Dickins: "An anon_vma
lookup points to a location which may contain the folio of interest, but
might instead contain another folio: and weeding out those other folios is
precisely what the "folio != pmd_folio((*pmd)" check (and the "risk of
replacing the wrong folio" comment a few lines above it) is for."

bpf: Scrub packet on bpf_redirect_peer

When bpf_redirect_peer is used to redirect packets to a device in
another network namespace, the skb isn't scrubbed. That can lead skb
information from one namespace to be "misused" in another namespace.

As one example, this is causing Cilium to drop traffic when using
bpf_redirect_peer to redirect packets that just went through IPsec
decryption to a container namespace. The following pwru trace shows (1)
the packet path from the host's XFRM layer to the container's XFRM
layer where it's dropped and (2) the number of active skb extensions at
each function.

                             .active_extensions = (__u8)2,

In this case, there are no XFRM policies in the container's network
namespace so the drop is unexpected. When we decrypt the IPsec packet,
the XFRM state used for decryption is set in the skb extensions. This
information is preserved across the netns switch. When we reach the
XFRM policy check in the container's netns, __xfrm_policy_check drops
the packet with LINUX_MIB_XFRMINNOPOLS because a (container-side) XFRM
policy can't be found that matches the (host-side) XFRM state used for
decryption.

This patch fixes this by scrubbing the packet when using
bpf_redirect_peer, as is done on typical netns switches via veth
devices except skb-&gt;mark and skb-&gt;tstamp are not zeroed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37960 | memblock: Accept allocated memory before use in memblock_double_array()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37960</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memblock: Accept allocated memory before use in memblock_double_array()

When increasing the array size in memblock_double_array() and the slab

reserve/allocate memory. However, the range returned may not have been

Mitigate this by calling accept_memory() on the memory range returned
before the slab is available.

Prior to v6.12, the accept_memory() interface used a 'start' and 'end'
parameter instead of 'start' and 'size', therefore the accept_memory()
call must be adjusted to specify 'start + size' for 'end' when applying
to kernels prior to v6.12.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37961 | ipvs: fix uninit-value for saddr in do_output_route4</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37961</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix memory leak in parse_lease_state()

The previous patch that added bounds check for create lease context
introduced a memory leak. When the bounds check fails, the function
returns NULL without freeing the previously allocated lease_ctx_info
structure.

This patch fixes the issue by adding kfree(lreq) before returning NULL
in both boundary check cases.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37963 | arm64: bpf: Only mitigate cBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37963</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm: Eliminate window where TLB flushes may be inadvertently skipped

tl;dr: There is a window in the mm switching code where the new CR3 is
set and the CPU should be getting TLB flushes for the new mm.  But
should_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by
widening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.

Long Version:

=== History ===

There were a few things leading up to this.

First, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was
made lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs
due to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull
mm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive
and skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are
again.

=== Problem ===

The too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:

	// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only
	// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:
	cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));

	next_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&amp;amp;next-&gt;context.tlb_gen);
	choose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &amp;amp;new_asid, &amp;amp;need_flush);
	load_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);
	// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*
	// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.

        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);
	// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()
	// become true!

should_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()
and writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be
suppressed.  Whoops.

=== Solution ===

Thankfully, the fuzzy "just about to write CR3" window is already marked
with loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in
should_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with
an IPI.

This will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small
and I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance
impact.

Update the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew
yet another user.

Peter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe
'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()
writes them.  Add a barrier to ensure that they are observed in the
order they are written.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:18:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37940 | ftrace: Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37940</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash()

When the kernel contains a large number of functions that can be traced,
the loop in ftrace_graph_set_hash() may take a lot of time to execute.
This may trigger the softlockup watchdog.

Add cond_resched() within the loop to allow the kernel to remain

This matches the cond_resched() that is used in other locations of the

wifi: ath12k: Fix invalid entry fetch in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process

Currently, ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process uses ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry
to fetch the next entry from the destination ring. This is incorrect because
ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry is intended for source rings, not destination
rings. This leads to invalid entry fetches, causing potential data corruption or
crashes due to accessing incorrect memory locations. This happens because the
source ring and destination ring have different handling mechanisms and using
the wrong function results in incorrect pointer arithmetic and ring management.

To fix this issue, replace the call to ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry with
ath12k_hal_srng_dst_get_next_entry in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process. This ensures
that the correct function is used for fetching entries from the destination
ring, preventing invalid memory accesses.

net: phy: allow MDIO bus PM ops to start/stop state machine for phylink-controlled PHY

DSA has 2 kinds of drivers:

1. Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from
   their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz
2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.

For type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -&gt; phylink_stop(),
and dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -&gt; phylink_start().
These seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because
that is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the
biggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.

Talking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which
do not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,
mdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),
I have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is
triggered:

	WARN_ON(phydev-&gt;state != PHY_HALTED &amp;&amp; phydev-&gt;state != PHY_READY &amp;&amp;
		phydev-&gt;state != PHY_UP);

because the PHY state machine is running.

It's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -&gt; ... -&gt;
phylink_start() -&gt; phy_start() having been initiated by the user.

The previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called
phy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state
PHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.

mdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for
phylink, the phydev-&gt;adjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a
technicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 ("phylib: fix PAL state
machine restart on resume"). That commit was written before phylink
existed, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which
don't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.
But phylink itself has historically not been developed with
suspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that
scenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior
to the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.

This issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to
the above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC
driver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where
the issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a
quick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:

drivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c

Make the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a
phydev-&gt;phy_link_change() implementation equal to the default
phy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that
the phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and
when phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/
started on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that
if phydev-&gt;phy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the
kernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.

The trace event verifier checks the formats of trace events to make sure
that they do not point at memory that is not in the trace event itself or

allocated when the event triggered and that same data is freed before the
event is read, then the kernel can crash by reading freed memory.

The verifier runs at boot up (or module load) and scans the print formats
of the events and checks their arguments to make sure that dereferenced
pointers are safe. If the format uses "%*p.." the verifier will ignore it,
and that could be dangerous. Cover this case as well.

powerpc64/ftrace: fix module loading without patchable function entries

get_stubs_size assumes that there must always be at least one patchable
function entry, which is not always the case (modules that export data
but no code), otherwise it returns -ENOEXEC and thus the section header
sh_size is set to that value. During module_memory_alloc() the size is
passed to execmem_alloc() after being page-aligned and thus set to zero
which will cause it to fail the allocation (and thus module loading) as
__vmalloc_node_range() checks for zero-sized allocs and returns null:

[  115.466896] module_64: cast_common: doesn't contain __patchable_function_entries.

irqchip/qcom-mpm: Prevent crash when trying to handle non-wake GPIOs

On Qualcomm chipsets not all GPIOs are wakeup capable. Those GPIOs do not
have a corresponding MPM pin and should not be handled inside the MPM
driver. The IRQ domain hierarchy is always applied, so it's required to
explicitly disconnect the hierarchy for those. The pinctrl-msm driver marks
these with GPIO_NO_WAKE_IRQ. qcom-pdc has a check for this, but
irq-qcom-mpm is currently missing the check. This is causing crashes when
setting up interrupts for non-wake GPIOs:

[CAUSE]
When btrfs_alloc_path() failed, btrfs_iget() directly returned without
releasing the inode already allocated by btrfs_iget_locked().

This results the above busy inode and trigger the kernel BUG.

[FIX]
Fix it by calling iget_failed() if btrfs_alloc_path() failed.

If we hit error inside btrfs_read_locked_inode(), it will properly call
iget_failed(), so nothing to worry about.

Although the iget_failed() cleanup inside btrfs_read_locked_inode() is a
break of the normal error handling scheme, let's fix the obvious bug
and backport first, then rework the error handling later.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37905 | firmware: arm_scmi: Balance device refcount when destroying devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37905</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scmi: Balance device refcount when destroying devices

Using device_find_child() to lookup the proper SCMI device to destroy
causes an unbalance in device refcount, since device_find_child() calls an
implicit get_device(): this, in turns, inhibits the call of the provided
release methods upon devices destruction.

As a consequence, one of the structures that is not freed properly upon
destruction is the internal struct device_private dev-&gt;p populated by the
drivers subsystem core.

KMemleak detects this situation since loading/unloding some SCMI driver
causes related devices to be created/destroyed without calling any
device_release method.

accel/ivpu: Fix locking order in ivpu_job_submit

Fix deadlock in job submission and abort handling.
When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault,
it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1).

After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context
and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread,
the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs
lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list.

This order of locking causes a deadlock. To resolve this issue,

bnxt_en: Fix out-of-bound memcpy() during ethtool -w

When retrieving the FW coredump using ethtool, it can sometimes cause
memory corruption:

BUG: KFENCE: memory corruption in __bnxt_get_coredump+0x3ef/0x670 [bnxt_en]

...

This happens when copying the coredump segment list in
bnxt_hwrm_dbg_dma_data() with the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST FW command.
The info-&gt;dest_buf buffer is allocated based on the number of coredump
segments returned by the FW.  The segment list is then DMA'ed by
the FW and the length of the DMA is returned by FW.  The driver then
copies this DMA'ed segment list to info-&gt;dest_buf.

In some cases, this DMA length may exceed the info-&gt;dest_buf length
and cause the above BUG condition.  Fix it by capping the copy
length to not exceed the length of info-&gt;dest_buf.  The extra
DMA data contains no useful information.

This code path is shared for the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST and the
HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE FW commands.  The buffering is different
for these 2 FW commands.  To simplify the logic, we need to move
the line to adjust the buffer length for HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE
up, so that the new check to cap the copy length will work for both
commands.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37912 | ice: Check VF VSI Pointer Value in ice_vc_add_fdir_fltr()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37912</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: avoid NULL pointer dereference in skb_dequeue()

A NULL pointer dereference can occur in skb_dequeue() when processing a
QCA firmware crash dump on WCN7851 (0489:e0f3).

[ 93.672166] Bluetooth: hci0: ACL memdump size(589824)

[ 93.672475] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
[ 93.672517] Workqueue: hci0 hci_devcd_rx [bluetooth]
[ 93.672598] RIP: 0010:skb_dequeue+0x50/0x80

The issue stems from handle_dump_pkt_qca() returning 0 even when a dump
packet is successfully processed. This is because it incorrectly
forwards the return value of hci_devcd_init() (which returns 0 on
success). As a result, the caller (btusb_recv_acl_qca() or
btusb_recv_evt_qca()) assumes the packet was not handled and passes it
to hci_recv_frame(), leading to premature kfree() of the skb.

Later, hci_devcd_rx() attempts to dequeue the same skb from the dump
queue, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by:
1. Making handle_dump_pkt_qca() return 0 on success and negative errno
   on failure, consistent with kernel conventions.
2. Splitting dump packet detection into separate functions for ACL
   and event packets for better structure and readability.

This ensures dump packets are properly identified and consumed, avoiding
double handling and preventing NULL pointer access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37919 | ASoC: amd: acp: Fix NULL pointer deref in acp_i2s_set_tdm_slot</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37919</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vxlan: vnifilter: Fix unlocked deletion of default FDB entry

When a VNI is deleted from a VXLAN device in 'vnifilter' mode, the FDB
entry associated with the default remote (assuming one was configured)
is deleted without holding the hash lock. This is wrong and will result
in a warning [1] being generated by the lockdep annotation that was
added by commit ebe642067455 ("vxlan: Create wrappers for FDB lookup").

Reproducer:

 # ip link add vx0 up type vxlan dstport 4789 external vnifilter local 192.0.2.1
 # bridge vni add vni 10010 remote 198.51.100.1 dev vx0
 # bridge vni del vni 10010 dev vx0

Fix by acquiring the hash lock before the deletion and releasing it
afterwards. Blame the original commit that introduced the issue rather
than the one that exposed it.

book3s64/radix : Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE

A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide
backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap
should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are
created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap
start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap
start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the
current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also.
During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two
namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does
not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a
normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads
to a kernel crash.

Another issue is that if there is no altmap, a PMD-sized vmemmap
page will be allocated from RAM, regardless of the alignment of
the section start address. If the section start address is not
aligned to the PMD size, a VM_BUG_ON will be triggered when
setting the PMD-sized page to page table.

In this patch, we are aligning the section vmemmap start address
to PAGE_SIZE. After alignment, the start address will not be
part of the current namespace, and a normal page will be allocated
for the vmemmap mapping of the current section. For the remaining
sections, altmaps will be allocated. During the free operation,
the normal page will be correctly freed.

In the same way, a PMD_SIZE vmemmap page will be allocated only if
the section start address is PMD_SIZE-aligned; otherwise, it will
fall back to a PAGE-sized vmemmap allocation.

iommu/amd: Fix potential buffer overflow in parse_ivrs_acpihid

There is a string parsing logic error which can lead to an overflow of hid
or uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn't
take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the
check is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid
string is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str
will be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer
which size is 256.

The same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with
length 250.

Check the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent
buffer overflow.

arm64: errata: Add missing sentinels to Spectre-BHB MIDR arrays

Commit a5951389e58d ("arm64: errata: Add newer ARM cores to the
spectre_bhb_loop_affected() lists") added some additional CPUs to the
Spectre-BHB workaround, including some new arrays for designs that
require new 'k' values for the workaround to be effective.

Unfortunately, the new arrays omitted the sentinel entry and so
is_midr_in_range_list() will walk off the end when it doesn't find a
match. With UBSAN enabled, this leads to a crash during boot when
is_midr_in_range_list() is inlined (which was more common prior to
c8c2647e69be ("arm64: Make  _midr_in_range_list() an exported

drm/nouveau: Fix WARN_ON in nouveau_fence_context_kill()

Nouveau is mostly designed in a way that it's expected that fences only
ever get signaled through nouveau_fence_signal(). However, in at least
one other place, nouveau_fence_done(), can signal fences, too. If that
happens (race) a signaled fence remains in the pending list for a while,
until it gets removed by nouveau_fence_update().

Should nouveau_fence_context_kill() run in the meantime, this would be
a bug because the function would attempt to set an error code on an
already signaled fence.

Have nouveau_fence_context_kill() check for a fence being signaled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37931 | btrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37931</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize

When running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started
seeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because
we were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects
all metadata writes.

When writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty
range.  If the range isn't dirty we do

	bit_start++;

to move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the
number of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k
pagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4
bits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per
page.

To make this easier this is how everything looks

[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address
[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset
[               64k page               ] folio
[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers
[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap

Now we use all of our addressing based on fs_info-&gt;sectorsize_bits, so
as you can see the above our 16k eb-&gt;start turns into radix entry 4.

When we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=
sectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the
next eb is 4, to correspond to eb-&gt;start 16k.

However if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now
put us offset from our radix tree entries.

In our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is
not dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop
around and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that
start using the following equation

	start = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info-&gt;sectorsize;

so in the case above, eb-&gt;start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start
as

	0 + 1 * fs_info-&gt;sectorsize = 4096
	4096 &gt;&gt; 12 = 1

Now we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.
What's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=
sectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into
the same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the
radix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.

The best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,
but that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix
it simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37932 | sch_htb: make htb_qlen_notify() idempotent</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37932</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: Fix host hang issue during device reboot

When the host loses heartbeat messages from the device,
the driver calls the device-specific ndo_stop function,
which frees the resources. If the driver is unloaded in
this scenario, it calls ndo_stop again, attempting to free
resources that have already been freed, leading to a host
hang issue. To resolve this, dev_close should be called
instead of the device-specific stop function.dev_close
internally calls ndo_stop to stop the network interface
and performs additional cleanup tasks. During the driver
unload process, if the device is already down, ndo_stop
is not called.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37934 | ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix pointer check in graph_util_parse_link_direction</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37934</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/intel: KVM: Mask PEBS_ENABLE loaded for guest with vCPU's value.

When generating the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value that will be loaded on
VM-Entry to a KVM guest, mask the value with the vCPU's desired PEBS_ENABLE
value.  Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in
running the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use
PEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply
looking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host
userspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.

Running the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as
crashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't
written MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when
trying to record PEBS events.

The issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before
commit 7b100989b4f6 ("perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default") (after
which, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).	The userspace side
of perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()
misconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.

Arguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events
simply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there
is no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad
userspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to
guest-owned events.

Note, commit 854250329c02 ("KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily
in two rare situations") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling
KVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only
KVM.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:40:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48014 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48014</link><description>Password guessing limits could be bypassed when using LDAP authentication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:22:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48015 | Observable Response Discrepancy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48015</link><description>Failed login response could be different depending on whether the username was local or central.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:22:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48016 | Improper Control of Interaction Frequency</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48016</link><description>OpenFlow discovery protocol can exhaust resources because it is not rate limited</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:22:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48017 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48017</link><description>Improper limitation of pathname in Circuit Provisioning and File Import applications allows modification and uploading of files</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:22:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48018 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48018</link><description>An authenticated user can modify application state data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 15:22:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33861 | IBM Security ReaQta improper certificate validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33861</link><description>IBM Security ReaQta EDR 3.12 could allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering with the communication path between the host and client.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:59:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41225 | VMware vCenter Server authenticated command-execution vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41225</link><description>The vCenter Server contains an authenticated command-execution vulnerability. A malicious actor with privileges to create or modify alarms and run script action may exploit this issue to run arbitrary commands on the vCenter Server.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:40:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41226 | Guest Operations Denial-of-Service Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41226</link><description>VMware ESXi contains a denial-of-service vulnerability that occurs when performing a guest operation. A malicious actor with guest operation privileges on a VM, who is already authenticated through vCenter Server or ESXi may trigger this issue to create a denial-of-service condition of guest VMs with VMware Tools running and guest operations enabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:40:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41227 | Denial-of-Service Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41227</link><description>VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a denial-of-service vulnerability due to certain guest options. A malicious actor with non-administrative privileges within a guest operating system may be able to exploit this issue by exhausting memory of the host process leading to a denial-of-service condition.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:40:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41228 | VMware ESXi and vCenter Server Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41228</link><description>VMware ESXi and vCenter Server contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability due to improper input validation. A malicious actor with network access to the login page of certain ESXi host or vCenter Server URL paths may exploit this issue to steal cookies or redirect to malicious websites.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26086 | An unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in RSI Queue Management System v3.0 within the TaskID parameter of the get reque...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26086</link><description>An unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in RSI Queue Management System v3.0 within the TaskID parameter of the get request handler.

By design, the file management module in TYPO3’s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type, with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful, such as executable binaries (e.g., `.exe` files), or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example, a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12 LTS. Although such files are not directly executable through the web server, their presence can introduce indirect risks. For example, third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:18:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4980 | Netgear DGND3700 mini_http currentsetting.htm information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4980</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Netgear DGND3700 1.1.00.15_1.00.15NA and classified as problematic.

When an administrator updates their own account or modifies other user accounts via the admin interface, the current password is not requested for verification. This behavior may lower the protection against unauthorized access in scenarios where an admin session is hijacked or left unattended, as it enables password changes without additional authentication.

A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.

Prior to version 2.25.1, rendering `{{ attributes }}` or using any method that returns a `ComponentAttributes` instance (e.g. `only()`, `defaults()`, `without()`) ouputs attribute values directly without escaping. If these values are unsafe (e.g. contain user input), this can lead to HTML attribute injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The issue is fixed in version `2.25.1` of `symfony/ux-twig-component` Those who use `symfony/ux-live-component` must also update it to `2.25.1` to benefit from the fix, as it reuses the `ComponentAttributes` class internally. As a workaround, avoid rendering `{{ attributes }}` or derived objects directly if it may contain untrusted values.
Instead, use `{{ attributes.render('name') }}` for safe output of individual attributes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 19:32:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47949 | samlify SAML Signature Wrapping attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47949</link><description>samlify is a Node.js library for SAML single sign-on.

Versions prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error, the internal `busboy` stream is not closed, violating Node.js stream safety guidance. This leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time, consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions, this can result in denial of service, requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted. Users should upgrade to 2.0.0 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 19:25:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47944 | Multer vulnerable to Denial of Service from maliciously crafted requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47944</link><description>Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 19:10:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39451 | WordPress JetBlocks For Elementor &amp;lt;= 1.3.16 - Broken Access Control Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39451</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Crocoblock JetBlocks For Elementor allows Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs.This issue affects JetBlocks For Elementor: from n/a through 1.3.16.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:56:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39458 | WordPress Foton theme &amp;lt;= 2.5.2 - Local File Inclusion vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39458</link><description>Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in Mikado-Themes Foton allows PHP Local File Inclusion.This issue affects Foton: from n/a through 2.5.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39459 | WordPress Real Estate 7 theme &amp;lt;= 3.5.2 - Privilege Escalation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39459</link><description>Incorrect Privilege Assignment vulnerability in Contempo Themes Real Estate 7 allows Privilege Escalation.This issue affects Real Estate 7: from n/a through 3.5.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43832 | WordPress Remote Images Grabber plugin &amp;lt;= 0.6 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43832</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in andreyk Remote Images Grabber allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Remote Images Grabber: from n/a through 0.6.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:56:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47283 | Bypassing project secret validation can lead to privilege escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47283</link><description>Gardener implements the automated management and operation of Kubernetes clusters as a service.

A security vulnerability was discovered in Gardener's External DNS Management prior to version 0.23.6 that could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or a user with administrative privileges for a shoot cluster, including administrative privileges for a single namespace of the shoot cluster, to obtain control over the seed cluster where the shoot cluster is managed. This CVE affects all Gardener installations no matter of the public cloud provider(s) used for the seed clusters/shoot clusters. The affected component is `gardener/external-dns-management`. The `external-dns-management` component may also be deployed on the seeds by the `gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-dns-service` extension when the extension is enabled. In this case, all versions of the `shoot-dns-service` extension `&lt;= v1.60.0` are affected by this vulnerability.

ALSA: ump: Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversion

The conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an
internal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as
it was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data.
However, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a
different format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in
do_convert_to_ump().  It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, and
may corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received.

The fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx
UMP message.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 07:22:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46801 | Pgpool-II provided by PgPool Global Development Group contains an authentication bypass by primary weakness vulnerability. if the vulnerabil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46801</link><description>Pgpool-II provided by PgPool Global Development Group contains an authentication bypass by primary weakness vulnerability. if the vulnerability is exploited, an attacker may be able to log in to the system as an arbitrary user, allowing them to read or tamper with data in the database, and/or disable the database.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 07:22:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4916 | PHPGurukul Auto Taxi Stand Management System admin-profile.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4916</link><description>A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Auto Taxi Stand Management System 1.0.

This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.

The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.

Impact:
* This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 03:11:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4905 | iop-apl-uw basestation3 QC.py load_qc_pickl deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4905</link><description>A vulnerability was found in iop-apl-uw basestation3 up to 3.0.4 and classified as problematic.
