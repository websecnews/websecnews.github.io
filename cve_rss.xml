LoongArch: KVM: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context

Like commit 2c0d278f3293f ("KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard
interrupt context") and commit 9090825fa9974 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Let the
timer expire in hardirq context on RT"), On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels
unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft interrupt expiry mode by default.
Then the timers are canceled from an preempt-notifier which is invoked
with disabled preemption which is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT.

The timer callback is short so in could be invoked in hard-IRQ context.
So let the timer expire on hard-IRQ context even on -RT.

This fix a "scheduling while atomic" bug for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels:

afs: Fix lock recursion

afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it
is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the -&gt;notify_lock, but it tries to
take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but
if the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must
be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through
rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the
-&gt;notify_lock again.

This case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops
looks something like:

bpf: Add sk_is_inet and IS_ICSK check in tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx

As the introduction of the support for vsock and unix sockets in sockmap,
tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx cannot presume the socket passed in must be IS_ICSK.
vsock and af_unix sockets have vsock_sock and unix_sock instead of
inet_connection_sock. For these sockets, tls_get_ctx may return an invalid
pointer and cause page fault in function tls_sw_ctx_rx.

virtio_pci: Fix admin vq cleanup by using correct info pointer

vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs() clean up admin vq
resources by virtio_pci_vq_info pointer. The info pointer of admin
vq is stored in vp_dev-&gt;admin_vq.info instead of vp_dev-&gt;vqs[].
Using the info pointer from vp_dev-&gt;vqs[] for admin vq causes a

In vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs(), get the info pointer
from vp_dev-&gt;admin_vq.info for admin vq to clean up the resources.
Also make info ptr as argument of vp_del_vq() to be symmetric with
vp_setup_vq().

nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning

We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the
controller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will
wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that
action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the

While running ISER over SIW, the initiator machine encounters a warning

send_page. To address this, it is better to add a sendpage_ok() check
within the driver itself, and if it returns 0, then MSG_SPLICE_PAGES flag

smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while
reconnecting to a server.  [0]

The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers
in non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but
it was always while the pod was dying.

The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.

CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that
the socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is
always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.

The repro steps are roughly:

  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns
  2. drop packets from the netns
  3. destroy the netns
  4. unmount CIFS

We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see
the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.

When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime
without holding refcnt due to async timers.

Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit
9744d2bf1976 ("smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().").

Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to
clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a
freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().

Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because
the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same
address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45194 | In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45194</link><description>In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.

First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion.

Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7. No known workarounds for the vulnerability are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:37:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45663 | IBM Db2 denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45663</link><description>IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) 11.1 and 11.5 is vulnerable to a denial of service as the server may crash under certain conditions with a specially crafted query.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:13:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52755 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.26A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the host_ip parameter in the ipsec_road_asp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52755</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.26A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the host_ip parameter in the ipsec_road_asp function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:57:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51151 | D-Link DI-8200 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to remote command execution in the msp_info_htm function via the flag parameter and cmd parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51151</link><description>D-Link DI-8200 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to remote command execution in the msp_info_htm function via the flag parameter and cmd parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:50:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9875 | Okta Privileged Access server agent (SFTD) versions 1.82.0 to 1.84.0 are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability when the sudo comm...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9875</link><description>Okta Privileged Access server agent (SFTD) versions 1.82.0 to 1.84.0 are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability when the sudo command bundles feature is enabled.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 22:31:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52581 | Litestar allows unbounded resource consumption (DoS vulnerability)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52581</link><description>Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 2.13.0, the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large files wrapped in a `multipart/form-data` request and cause excessive memory consumption on the server. The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design. The public method signature as well as its implementation both expect the entire request body to be available as a single byte string. It is not possible to accept large file uploads in a safe way using this parser. This may be a regression, as a variation of this issue was already reported in CVE-2023-25578. Limiting the part number is not sufficient to prevent out-of-memory errors on the server. A patch is available in version 2.13.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:54:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52765 | H3C GR-1800AX MiniGRW1B0V100R007 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via the aspForm parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52765</link><description>H3C GR-1800AX MiniGRW1B0V100R007 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via the aspForm parameter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48531 | A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the Rental Availability module of eSoft Planner 3.24.08271-USA allows attackers to e...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48531</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the Rental Availability module of eSoft Planner 3.24.08271-USA allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser via injecting a crafted payload.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:40:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48533 | A discrepancy between responses for valid and invalid e-mail accounts in the Forgot your Login?

This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there.

When parsing hci reports, the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report, uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report, etc. In doing this, it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not, however, validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible, though unlikely, that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied, it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:30:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48986 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

The subsequent write operation, however, copies the amount of data specified in the packet header, which may lead to a buffer overflow.

Zimbra Webmail (Modern UI) is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to improper sanitization of user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into specific fields of an e-mail message. When the victim adds the attacker to their contacts, the malicious code is stored and executed when viewing the contact list. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary mail sending, mailbox exfiltration, profile picture alteration, and other malicious actions. Proper sanitization and escaping of input fields are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48983 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large, no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state, where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48981 | An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0.

During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet header by looking up the identifying first byte and matching it against a table of possible lengths. The initial parsing function, hciTrSerialRxIncoming does not drop packets with invalid identifiers but also does not set a safe default for the length of unknown packets' headers, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to a not-yet-allocated buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which state of packet parsing is currently occurring. Because the buffer is allocated when the last byte of the header has been copied, the combination of having a bad header length variable that will never match the counter variable and being able to overwrite the state variable with the resulting buffer overflow can be used to advance the function to the next step while skipping the buffer allocation and resulting pointer write. The next 16 bytes from the packet body are then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52754 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the fn parameter in the tgfile_htm function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52754</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the fn parameter in the tgfile_htm function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:48:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52757 | D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the notify parameter in the arp_sys_asp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52757</link><description>D-LINK DI-8003 v16.07.16A1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the notify parameter in the arp_sys_asp function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:48:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33439 | An issue in Kasda LinkSmart Router KW5515 v1.7 and before allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands via cgi p...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33439</link><description>An issue in Kasda LinkSmart Router KW5515 v1.7 and before allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands via cgi parameters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:53:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45511 | An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) through 10.1.

Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52597 | 2FAuth vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via SVG upload and direct access render</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52597</link><description>2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Versions prior to 5.4.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting due to improper headers in direct access to uploaded SVGs. The application allows uploading images in several places. One of the accepted types of image is SVG, which allows JS scripting. Therefore, by uploading a malicious SVG which contains JS code, an attacker which is able to drive a victim to the uploaded image could compromise that victim's session and access to their tokens. Version 5.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-10913 | Clone &amp;lt;= 2.4.6 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection via &amp;#x27;recursive_unserialized_replace&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10913</link><description>The Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'recursive_unserialized_replace' function.
