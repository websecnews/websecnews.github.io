Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 5.0.2, the `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default in Sprig enables capturing of env variables on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations, on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive environment variables. Users should upgrade to v5.0.2 to mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 16:46:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-25999 | WordPress BodyCenter - Gym, Fitness WooCommerce WordPress Theme &amp;lt;= 2.4 - Local File Inclusion Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25999</link><description>Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in snstheme BodyCenter - Gym, Fitness WooCommerce WordPress Theme allows PHP Local File Inclusion.

Prior to version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch, Codepen is present in the default `allowed_iframes` site setting, and it can potentially auto-run arbitrary JS in the iframe scope, which is unintended. This issue is patched in version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, the Codepen prefix can be removed from a site's `allowed_iframes`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:04:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49006 | Wasp has case insensitive OAuth ID vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49006</link><description>Wasp (Web Application Specification) is a Rails-like framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma. Prior to version 0.16.6, Wasp authentication has a vulnerability in the OAuth authentication implementation (affecting only Keycloak with a specific config). Wasp currently lowercases OAuth user IDs before storing / fetching them. This behavior violates OAuth and OpenID Connect specifications and can result in user impersonation, account collisions, and privilege escalation. In practice, out of the OAuth providers that Wasp auth supports, only Keycloak is affected. Keycloak uses a lowercase UUID by default, but users can configure it to be case sensitive, making it affected. Google, GitHub, and Discord use numerical IDs, making them not affected. Users should update their Wasp version to `0.16.6` which has a fix for the problematic behavior. Users using Keycloak can work around the issue by not using a case sensitive user ID in their realm configuration.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:04:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49013 | WilderForge vulnerable to code Injection via GitHub Actions Workflows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49013</link><description>WilderForge is a Wildermyth coremodding API. A critical vulnerability has been identified in multiple projects across the WilderForge organization. The issue arises from unsafe usage of `${{ github.event.review.body }}` and other user controlled variables directly inside shell script contexts in GitHub Actions workflows. This introduces a code injection vulnerability: a malicious actor submitting a crafted pull request review containing shell metacharacters or commands could execute arbitrary shell code on the GitHub Actions runner. This can lead to arbitrary command execution with the permissions of the workflow, potentially compromising CI infrastructure, secrets, and build outputs. Developers who maintain or contribute to the repos WilderForge/WilderForge, WilderForge/ExampleMod, WilderForge/WilderWorkspace, WilderForge/WildermythGameProvider, WilderForge/AutoSplitter, WilderForge/SpASM, WilderForge/thrixlvault, WilderForge/MassHash, and/or WilderForge/DLC_Disabler; as well as users who fork any of the above repositories and reuse affected GitHub Actions workflows, are affected. End users of any the above software and users who only install pre-built releases or artifacts are not affected. This vulnerability does not impact runtime behavior of the software or compiled outputs unless those outputs were produced during exploitation of this vulnerability. A current workaround is to disable GitHub Actions in affected repositories, or remove the affected workflows.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:04:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49130 | Laravel Translation Manager Vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49130</link><description>Laravel Translation Manager is a package to manage Laravel translation files. Prior to version 0.6.8, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities. Only authenticated users with access to the translation manager are impacted. The issue is fixed in version 0.6.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:04:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-49131 | FastGPT Sandbox Vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49131</link><description>FastGPT is an open-source project that provides a platform for building, deploying, and operating AI-driven workflows and conversational agents. The Sandbox container (fastgpt-sandbox) is a specialized, isolated environment used by FastGPT to safely execute user-submitted or dynamically generated code in isolation. The sandbox before version 4.9.11 has insufficient isolation and inadequate restrictions on code execution by allowing overly permissive syscalls, which allows attackers to escape the intended sandbox boundaries. Attackers could exploit this to read and overwrite arbitrary files and bypass Python module import restrictions. This is patched in version 4.9.11 by restricting the allowed system calls to a safer subset and additional descriptive error messaging.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:04:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40668 | Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in TCMAN GIM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40668</link><description>Incorrect authorization vulnerability in TCMAN's GIM v11.

As the removal of bcm_op's is already implemented with rcu handling this
patch adds the missing rcu_read_lock() and makes sure the list entries
are properly removed under rcu protection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38004 | can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updates</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38004</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updates

The CAN broadcast manager (CAN BCM) can send a sequence of CAN frames via
hrtimer. The content and also the length of the sequence can be changed
resp reduced at runtime where the 'currframe' counter is then set to zero.

Although this appeared to be a safe operation the updates of 'currframe'
can be triggered from user space and hrtimer context in bcm_can_tx().
Anderson Nascimento created a proof of concept that triggered a KASAN
slab-out-of-bounds read access which can be prevented with a spin_lock_bh.

At the rework of bcm_can_tx() the 'count' variable has been moved into
the protected section as this variable can be modified from both contexts
too.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55585 | moPS App Engine 1.8.618 has incorrect access control.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55585</link><description>moPS App Engine 1.8.618 has incorrect access control.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 19:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5840 | SourceCodester Client Database Management System user_update_customer_order.php unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5840</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0.
