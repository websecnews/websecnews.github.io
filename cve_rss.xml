a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 06:37:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2907 | AGCA – Custom Dashboard &amp;amp; Login Page &amp;lt; 7.2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Image URL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2907</link><description>The AGCA  WordPress plugin before 7.2.2 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 05:19:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4161 | Syslog traffic sent in clear-text</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4161</link><description>In Brocade SANnav, before Brocade SANnav v2.3.0, syslog traffic received

binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()

Commit 6d98eb95b450 ("binder: avoid potential data leakage when copying
txn") introduced changes to how binder objects are copied. In doing so,
it unintentionally removed an offset alignment check done through calls
to binder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -&gt; check_buffer().

These calls were replaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(),
so now an explicit offset alignment check is needed here. This avoids
later complications when unwinding the objects gets harder.

It is worth noting this check existed prior to commit 7a67a39320df
("binder: add function to copy binder object from buffer"), likely
removed due to redundancy at the time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:33:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23527 | An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in WLAvalancheService component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3, in certain conditions can allow an una...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23527</link><description>An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in WLAvalancheService component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3, in certain conditions can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read sensitive information in memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:23:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29205 | An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti P...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29205</link><description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests in-order-to cause service disruptions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 23:23:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26923 | af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26923</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()

Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo getting
enqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that
carries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see a
different set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight
count, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.

sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM
S is an unconnected socket
L is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtable
V's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumped

connect(S, addr)	sendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)	__unix_gc()
----------------	-------------------------	-----------

NS = unix_create1()
skb1 = sock_wmalloc(NS)
L = unix_find_other(addr)
unix_state_lock(L)
unix_peer(S) = NS
			// V count=1 inflight=0

 			NS = unix_peer(S)
 			skb2 = sock_alloc()
			skb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V])

			// V became in-flight
			// V count=2 inflight=1

			close(V)

			// V count=1 inflight=1
			// GC candidate condition met

						for u in gc_inflight_list:
						  if (total_refs == inflight_refs)
						    add u to gc_candidates

						// gc_candidates={L, V}

						for u in gc_candidates:
						  scan_children(u, dec_inflight)

						// embryo (skb1) was not
						// reachable from L yet, so V's
						// inflight remains unchanged
__skb_queue_tail(L, skb1)
unix_state_unlock(L)
						for u in gc_candidates:
						  if (u.inflight)
						    scan_children(u, inc_inflight_move_tail)

						// V count=1 inflight=2 (!)

If there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This
makes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After
flipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if
there is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At
this point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already
taken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:55:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26924 | netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26924</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element

Pablo reports a crash with large batches of elements with a
back-to-back add/remove pattern.  Quoting Pablo:

  add_elem("00000000") timeout 100 ms
  ...
  add_elem("0000000X") timeout 100 ms
  del_elem("0000000X") &lt;---------------- delete one that was just added
  ...
  add_elem("00005000") timeout 100 ms

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove
function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent
element.

netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort path

The commit mutex should not be released during the critical section
between nft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC
worker could collect expired objects and get the released commit lock
within the same GC sequence.

nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex to load
module dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transaction again.
Move it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() is called.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:55:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20248 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) Software could allow an authenticated, re...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20248</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.

It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS.

The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges.

All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 19:16:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4125 | Tenda W15E setStaticRoute formSetStaticRoute stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4125</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in Tenda W15E 15.11.0.14 and classified as critical.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the device reloads.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 18:30:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20359 | A vulnerability in a legacy capability that allowed for the preloading of VPN clients and plug-ins and that has been available in Cisco Adap...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20359</link><description>A vulnerability in a legacy capability that allowed for the preloading of VPN clients and plug-ins and that has been available in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges. Administrator-level privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper validation of a file when it is read from system flash memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a crafted file to the disk0: file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device after the next reload of the device, which could alter system behavior. Because the injected code could persist across device reboots, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium to High.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 18:30:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4121 | Tenda W15E formQOSRuleDel stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4121</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Tenda W15E 15.11.0.14.

A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in the V2 state resolution algorithm. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service. Servers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later. Some workarounds are available. One can ban the malicious users or ACL block servers from the rooms and/or leave the room and purge the room using the admin API.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 17:38:08
