f2fs: fix to avoid out-of-boundary access in dnode page

The root cause is in the corrupted image, there is a dnode has the same
node id w/ its inode, so during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data(), it tries to
access block address in dnode at offset 934, however it parses the dnode
as inode node, so that get_dnode_addr() returns 360, then it tries to
access page address from 360 + 934 * 4 = 4096 w/ 4 bytes.

To fix this issue, let's add sanity check for node id of all direct nodes
during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data().</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:30:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9681 | O2OA Personal Profile agent cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9681</link><description>A flaw has been found in O2OA up to 10.0-410.

Prior to version 3.4.11, a remote code execution vulnerability was identified, caused by improper validation of uploaded files. The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames, including those with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate sanitization or extension restrictions, a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded and executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 22:20:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57752 | Next.js Affected by Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization API Routes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57752</link><description>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications.

After the CVE-2025-24358 fix, a network attacker that places a form at http://example.com can't get it to submit to https://example.com because the Origin header is checked with sameOrigin against a synthetic URL. However, if a host is added to TrustedOrigins, both its HTTP and HTTPS origins will be allowed, because the schema of the synthetic URL is ignored and only the host is checked. For example, if an application is hosted on https://example.com and adds example.net to TrustedOrigins, a network attacker can serve a form at http://example.net to perform the attack. Applications should migrate to net/http.CrossOriginProtection, introduced in Go 1.25. If that is not an option, a backport is available as a module at filippo.io/csrf, and a drop-in replacement for the github.com/gorilla/csrf API is available at filippo.io/csrf/gorilla.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:59:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55750 | Gitpod Classic Affected by Bitbucket OAuth Token Exposure via Redirect Fragment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55750</link><description>Gitpod is a developer platform for cloud development environments. In versions before main-gha.33628 for both Gitpod Classic and Gitpod Classic Enterprise, OAuth integration with Bitbucket in certain conditions allowed a crafted link to expose a valid Bitbucket access token via the URL fragment when clicked by an authenticated user. This resulted from how Bitbucket returned tokens and how Gitpod handled the redirect flow. The issue was limited to Bitbucket (GitHub and GitLab integrations were not affected), required user interaction, and has been mitigated through redirect handling and OAuth logic hardening. The issue was resolved in main-gha.33628 and later. There are no workarounds.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:59:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55177 | Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55177</link><description>Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device.

This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.

Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.

The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

Impact

By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:

  *  Break the current HTTP header
  *  Inject a new header or entire body
  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
That can lead to the following attacks:

  *  reflected XSS
  *  open redirect
  *  cache poisoning
  *  header manipulation</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 01:11:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43187 | This issue was addressed by removing the vulnerable code.
