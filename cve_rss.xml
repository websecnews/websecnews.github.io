When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM, it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising data confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1087 | Arbitrary Code Execution in Kong Insomnia Desktop Application</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1087</link><description>Kong Insomnia Desktop Application before 11.0.2 contains a template injection vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenario's where you only load trusted configurations. 


Users that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:44:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3949 | Website Builder by SeedProd — Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode &amp;lt;= 6.18.15 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Information Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3949</link><description>The Website Builder by SeedProd — Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'seedprod_lite_get_revisisons' function in all versions up to, and including, 6.18.15.

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly
the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
we clean up the dev-&gt;dma_iommu flag along with everything else.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37878 | perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37878</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event-&gt;ctx assignment to
occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
child_event-&gt;ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the
cleanup code.

Details:

There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of
multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not
a single regression.

The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early
validity check for child_event was added before the
refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
added, assuming event-&gt;ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
check passed but before child_event-&gt;ctx was assigned, violating its
precondition. The solution is to assign child_event-&gt;ctx right after
its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event-&gt;ctx assignment
directly after child_event-&gt;pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
event-&gt;pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event-&gt;ctx is
non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

um: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode

sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in
time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with
time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a
sched_yield syscall.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37881 | usb: gadget: aspeed: Add NULL pointer check in ast_vhub_init_dev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37881</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Fix isochronous Ring Underrun/Overrun event handling

The TRB pointer of these events points at enqueue at the time of error
occurrence on xHCI 1.1+ HCs or it's NULL on older ones. By the time we
are handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.

I can trigger this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ
handling delay. Similar delay may occur naturally due to system load.

If this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed TDs will be
skipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could
be given back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.

Don't complete TDs on xrun events and don't warn if queued TDs don't
match the event's TRB pointer, which can be NULL or a link/no-op TRB.
Don't warn if there are no queued TDs at all.

Now that it's safe, also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear.
This ensures completion of any TD stuck in 'error mid TD' state right
before the xrun event, which could happen if a driver submits a finite
number of URBs to a buggy HC and then an error occurs on the last TD.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37883 | s390/sclp: Add check for get_zeroed_page()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37883</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postable

Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the
*new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of
the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an
MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.

The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to
the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free,
e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37886 | pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37886</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info

Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather
than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()
is done so that the context is still available after the wait
loop has given up.

There was a case where a slow development firmware caused
the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally
finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried
to complete_all() the completion context that had been created
on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.
This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing
and gnashing of teeth.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37887 | pds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37887</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result

If the FW doesn't support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL command
the driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst
crash when the user runs the "devlink dev info" devlink command.

This happens because the stack variable fw_list is not 0
initialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a
garbage value from the stack.  Then the driver tries to access
fw_list.fw_names[i] with i &gt;= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end
of the array.

Fix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing
completely if the devcmd fails because other useful information
is printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd fails.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37888 | net/mlx5: Fix null-ptr-deref in mlx5_create_{inner_,}ttc_table()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37888</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance causing leaks and use-after-free

Commit ef7134c7fc48 ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network
namespace.") attempted to fix a netns use-after-free issue by manually
adjusting reference counts via sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt and sock_inuse_add().

However, a later commit e9f2517a3e18 ("smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock
after rmmod") pointed out that the approach of manually setting
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt in the first commit was technically incorrect, as
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt should only be set for user sockets. It led to issues
like TCP timers not being cleared properly on close. The second commit
moved to a model of just holding an extra netns reference for
server-&gt;ssocket using get_net(), and dropping it when the server is torn
down.

But there remain some gaps in the get_net()/put_net() balancing added by
these commits. The incomplete reference handling in these fixes results
in two issues:

1. Netns refcount leaks[1]

The problem process is as follows:

```
mount.cifs                        cifsd

cifs_do_mount
  cifs_mount
    cifs_mount_get_session
      cifs_get_tcp_session
        get_net()  /* First get net. */
        ip_connect
          generic_ip_connect /* Try port 445 */
            get_net()
            -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
            put_net()
          generic_ip_connect /* Try port 139 */
            get_net() /* Missing matching put_net() for this get_net().*/
      cifs_get_smb_ses
        cifs_negotiate_protocol
          smb2_negotiate
            SMB2_negotiate
              cifs_send_recv
                wait_for_response
                                 cifs_demultiplex_thread
                                   cifs_read_from_socket
                                     cifs_readv_from_socket
                                       cifs_reconnect
                                         cifs_abort_connection
                                           sock_release();
                                           server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
                                           /* Missing put_net() here. */
                                           generic_ip_connect
                                             get_net()
                                             -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
                                             put_net()
                                             sock_release();
                                             server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
          free_rsp_buf
    ...
                                   clean_demultiplex_info
                                     /* It's only called once here. */
                                     put_net()
```

When cifs_reconnect() is triggered, the server-&gt;ssocket is released
without a corresponding put_net() for the reference acquired in
generic_ip_connect() before. it ends up calling generic_ip_connect()
again to retry get_net(). After that, server-&gt;ssocket is set to NULL
in the error path of generic_ip_connect(), and the net count cannot be
released in the final clean_demultiplex_info() function.

2. Potential use-after-free

The current refcounting scheme can lead to a potential use-after-free issue
in the following scenario:

```
 cifs_do_mount
   cifs_mount
     cifs_mount_get_session
       cifs_get_tcp_session
         get_net()  /* First get net */
           ip_connect
             generic_ip_connect
               get_net()
               bind_socket
	         kernel_bind /* failed */
               put_net()
         /* after out_err_crypto_release label */
         put_net()
         /* after out_err label */
         put_net()
```

In the exception handling process where binding the socket fails, the
get_net() and put_net() calls are unbalanced, which may cause the
server-&gt;net reference count to drop to zero and be prematurely released.

To address both issues, this patch ties the netns reference counti

This is because the LVCMDQ queue memory are managed by devres, while that
dmam_free_coherent() is called in the context of devm_action_release().

Jason pointed out that "arm_smmu_impl_probe() has mis-ordered the devres
callbacks if ops-&gt;device_remove() is going to be manually freeing things
that probe allocated":
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20250407174408.GB1722458@nvidia.com/

In fact, tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures() only allocates memory resources
which means any failure that it generates would be similar to -ENOMEM, so
there is no point in having that "falling back to standard SMMU" routine,
as the standard SMMU would likely fail to allocate memory too.

Remove the unwind part in tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures(), and return a
proper error code to ask SMMU driver to call tegra241_cmdqv_remove() via
impl_ops-&gt;device_remove(). Then, drop tegra241_vintf_free_lvcmdq() since
devres will take care of that.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37839 | jbd2: remove wrong sb-&amp;gt;s_sequence check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37839</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check

Hot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race
condition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires
pci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child
hotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire
pci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.

The deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()
first, not if the child happens to acquire it first.

Several workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded
over the years, e.g.:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/

A proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial
and necessarily intrusive.

Recent commit 9d573d19547b ("PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during
system sleep") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when
removing more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit
sought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.
Differentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible
because pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as
if it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.

Avoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the
hotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking
whether its child device was replaced.

This works because the -&gt;resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down
order for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device
replacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using
pci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably
detect being removed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37844 | cifs: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dbg call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37844</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

or a different future user of bg_list, better to be safe than sorry.

fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation

The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 &lt;&lt;
l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with &gt;2TB
aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined
behavior and improper AG sizing.

On 32-bit architectures:
- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow
- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in
sbi-&gt;bmap-&gt;db_agsize
- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures
- Could lead to:
  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations
  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses
  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures

Fix by casting to s64 before shifting:
bmp-&gt;db_agsize = (s64)1 &lt;&lt; l2agsize;

This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast
matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in
JFS block calculation code.

net: dsa: clean up FDB, MDB, VLAN entries on unbind

As explained in many places such as commit b117e1e8a86d ("net: dsa:
delete dsa_legacy_fdb_add and dsa_legacy_fdb_del"), DSA is written given
the assumption that higher layers have balanced additions/deletions.
As such, it only makes sense to be extremely vocal when those
assumptions are violated and the driver unbinds with entries still
present.

But Ido Schimmel points out a very simple situation where that is wrong:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/ZDazSM5UsPPjQuKr@shredder/
(also briefly discussed by me in the aforementioned commit).

Basically, while the bridge bypass operations are not something that DSA
explicitly documents, and for the majority of DSA drivers this API
simply causes them to go to promiscuous mode, that isn't the case for
all drivers. Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass
operations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().

Although in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,
we made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address
filters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,
and setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the
fact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as
kernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick
hack.

It seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim
.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP
in order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from
running, although we could do that.

Accepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.
Especially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different
angle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even
for VLANs:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

What happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,
then the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.

This is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an
informational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see
that bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'
experience, to justify the logic.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37865 | net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported

Russell King reports that on the ZII dev rev B, deleting a bridge VLAN
from a user port fails with -ENOENT:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lQXNP0s5-IiJzd@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

This comes from mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() -&gt; mv88e6xxx_mst_put(),
which tries to find an MST entry in &amp;amp;chip-&gt;msts associated with the SID,
but fails and returns -ENOENT as such.

But we know that this chip does not support MST at all, so that is not
surprising. The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()
not exit early:

	if (!sid)
		return 0;

And the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which
supposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().
But some chip-&gt;info-&gt;ops-&gt;vtu_getnext() implementations do not populate
vlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,
later in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is
just residual stack memory.

Testing for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge
VLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and
installed by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the
STU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,
so although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to
zero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the
coincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to
the same (correct) behavior.

Another option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for
mv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one
which already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means
the caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access
uninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.

So we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the
sid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure
fields which might get temporarily accessed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37866 | mlxbf-bootctl: use sysfs_emit_at() in secure_boot_fuse_state_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37866</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/userptr: fix notifier vs folio deadlock

User is reporting what smells like notifier vs folio deadlock, where
migrate_pages_batch() on core kernel side is holding folio lock(s) and
then interacting with the mappings of it, however those mappings are
tied to some userptr, which means calling into the notifier callback and
grabbing the notifier lock. With perfect timing it looks possible that
the pages we pulled from the hmm fault can get sniped by
migrate_pages_batch() at the same time that we are holding the notifier
lock to mark the pages as accessed/dirty, but at this point we also want
to grab the folio locks(s) to mark them as dirty, but if they are
contended from notifier/migrate_pages_batch side then we deadlock since
folio lock won't be dropped until we drop the notifier lock.

Fortunately the mark_page_accessed/dirty is not really needed in the
first place it seems and should have already been done by hmm fault, so
just remove it.

[Why]
When link training fails, the phy clock will be disabled. However, in
enable_streams, it is assumed that link training succeeded and the
mux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.

[How]
When enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall

nfsd: decrease sc_count directly if fail to queue dl_recall

A deadlock warning occurred when invoking nfs4_put_stid following a failed
dl_recall queue operation:
            T1                            T2
                                nfs4_laundromat
                                 nfs4_get_client_reaplist
                                  nfs4_anylock_blockers
__break_lease
 spin_lock // ctx-&gt;flc_lock
                                   spin_lock // clp-&gt;cl_lock
                                   nfs4_lockowner_has_blockers
                                    locks_owner_has_blockers
                                     spin_lock // flctx-&gt;flc_lock
 nfsd_break_deleg_cb
  nfsd_break_one_deleg
   nfs4_put_stid
    refcount_dec_and_lock
     spin_lock // clp-&gt;cl_lock

When a file is opened, an nfs4_delegation is allocated with sc_count
initialized to 1, and the file_lease holds a reference to the delegation.
The file_lease is then associated with the file through kernel_setlease.

The disassociation is performed in nfsd4_delegreturn via the following
call chain:
nfsd4_delegreturn --&gt; destroy_delegation --&gt; destroy_unhashed_deleg --&gt;
nfs4_unlock_deleg_lease --&gt; kernel_setlease --&gt; generic_delete_lease
The corresponding sc_count reference will be released after this
disassociation.

Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the
disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock
in generic_delete_lease. This means:
1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0;
2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to
acquire cl_lock;
3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created.

Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can
safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach
effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37872 | net: txgbe: fix memory leak in txgbe_probe() error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37872</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 06:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3455 | 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time &amp;lt;= 2.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3455</link><description>The 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin – 100% FREE for a limited time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'start_restore' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.

sound/virtio: Fix cancel_sync warnings on uninitialized work_structs

Betty reported hitting the following warning:

...

It seems we're hitting the error path in virtsnd_probe(), which
triggers a virtsnd_remove() which iterates over the substreams
calling cancel_work_sync() on the elapsed_period work_struct.

Looking at the code, from earlier in:
virtsnd_probe()-&gt;virtsnd_build_devs()-&gt;virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg()

We set snd-&gt;nsubstreams, allocate the snd-&gt;substreams, and if
we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in
virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having
initialized the elapsed_period work_struct.

When that error path unwinds we then call virtsnd_remove()
which as long as the substreams array is allocated, will iterate
through calling cancel_work_sync() on the uninitialized work
struct hitting this warning.

Takashi Iwai suggested this fix, which initializes the substreams
structure right after allocation, so that if we hit the error
paths we avoid trying to cleanup uninitialized data.

Note: I have not yet managed to reproduce the issue myself, so
this patch has had limited testing.

Feedback or thoughts would be appreciated!</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37806 | fs/ntfs3: Keep write operations atomic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37806</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Keep write operations atomic

syzbot reported a NULL pointer dereference in __generic_file_write_iter. [1]

Before the write operation is completed, the user executes ioctl[2] to clear
the compress flag of the file, which causes the is_compressed() judgment to
return 0, further causing the program to enter the wrong process and call the
wrong ops ntfs_aops_cmpr, which triggers the null pointer dereference of
write_begin.

Use inode lock to synchronize ioctl and write to avoid this case.

bpf: Fix kmemleak warning for percpu hashmap

Further investigation shows the reason is due to not 8-byte aligned
store of percpu pointer in htab_elem_set_ptr():
  *(void __percpu **)(l-&gt;key + key_size) = pptr;

Note that the whole htab_elem alignment is 8 (for x86_64). If the key_size
is 4, that means pptr is stored in a location which is 4 byte aligned but
not 8 byte aligned. In mm/kmemleak.c, scan_block() scans the memory based
on 8 byte stride, so it won't detect above pptr, hence reporting the memory
leak.

In htab_map_alloc(), we already have

        htab-&gt;elem_size = sizeof(struct htab_elem) +
                          round_up(htab-&gt;map.key_size, 8);
        if (percpu)
                htab-&gt;elem_size += sizeof(void *);
        else
                htab-&gt;elem_size += round_up(htab-&gt;map.value_size, 8);

So storing pptr with 8-byte alignment won't cause any problem and can fix
kmemleak too.

The issue can be reproduced with bpf selftest as well:
  1. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK config
  2. Add a getchar() before skel destroy in test_hash_map() in prog_tests/for_each.c.
     The purpose is to keep map available so kmemleak can be detected.
  3. run './test_progs -t for_each/hash_map &amp;' and a kmemleak should be reported.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37808 | crypto: null - Use spin lock instead of mutex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37808</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This check is performed before prepare_transfer() and prepare_ring(), so

it will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.

Then enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer. It will crash the kernel right

tty: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for all usages of TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT

This requirement was overeagerly loosened in commit 2f83e38a095f
("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN"), but as
it turns out,

  (1) the logic I implemented there was inconsistent (apologies!),

  (2) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT might actually be a small security risk
      after all, and

  (3) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only meant to be used by the mouse
      daemon (GPM or Consolation), which runs as CAP_SYS_ADMIN
      already.

In more detail:

1. The previous patch has inconsistent logic:

   In commit 2f83e38a095f ("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes
   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN"), we checked for sel_mode ==
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of
   this "mode" parameter were actually used as an additional way to
   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not
   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.

   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have
   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the
   value of the "hidden" mouse button argument.

   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with
   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/

2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can
   let an attacker simulate "keyboard" input to command line
   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other
   TIOCLINUX "selection mode" IOCTLs.

   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse
   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate
   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI
   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with
   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.

   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to
   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because
   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The
   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,
   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes
   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.

   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/

   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it
   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 ("tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be
   disabled")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with
   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would
   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before
   commit 2f83e38a095f ("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN").

3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or
   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:

   To quote console_codes(4):

     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console
     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these
     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the
     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These
     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application
     such as the gpm(8) daemon.

   Jared Finder has also confirmed in
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/
   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it
   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that
   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Resolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the

generic_handle_irq.

A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was

the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the

mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use

gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[]
and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length
*without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to
buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:

[   80.842193] memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0

The easiest fix would be to just drop the counted-by but with the exception
of the ack buffer in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only contains enough room
for the packet-header, all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a buffer
of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.

Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split the vsc_tp_packet struct
definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed
size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer
overrun checking still works when enabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37817 | mcb: fix a double free bug in chameleon_parse_gdd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37817</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD

LoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot
even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no
mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry
value (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.

The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address
as a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
&amp;&amp; !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a
coincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to
kernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().

Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to
check the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the
entry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULL
instead of the pointer to the slot.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37819 | irqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37819</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/eevdf: Fix se-&gt;slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash

There is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a
sched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.

The offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a
delayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.
In that case:

1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of
   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to
   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then
   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.
2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.
3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration
   tries to dequeue the parent.
4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the
   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.
5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's -&gt;slice to
   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.

This throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic
results. A manifestation we saw in production was:

6. In update_entity_lag(), se-&gt;slice is used to calculate limit, which
   ends up as a huge negative number.
7. limit is used in se-&gt;vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit
   is negative, vlag &gt; limit, so se-&gt;vlag is set to the same huge
   negative number.
8. In place_entity(), se-&gt;vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in
   another huge (positive or negative) number.
9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se-&gt;vruntime, which increases or
   decreases se-&gt;vruntime by a huge number.
10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which
    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the
    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the
    (vruntime - cfs_rq-&gt;min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.
11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.
12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of
    pick_eevdf() and crashes.

Dumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale
huge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se-&gt;slice
being set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually "benign" since
the rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).

Fix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first
non-empty cfs_rq.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37822 | riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37822</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

 BTRFS error (device sdc): zoned: write pointer offset mismatch of zones in raid1 profile

When a RAID1 block-group is created and a write pointer mismatch between
the disks in the RAID set is detected, btrfs sets the alloc_offset to the
length of the block group marking it as full. Afterwards the code expects
that a balance operation will evacuate the data in this block-group and
repair the problems.

But before this is possible, the new space of this block-group will be
accounted in the free space cache. But in __btrfs_

scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()

A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:
once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq-&gt;mq_hctx to
NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in
ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is
dereferenced, the kernel will crash.

Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an
error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer
dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is
removed.

This is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 ("scsi: ufs: core: Fix
ufshcd_abort_one racing issue").

This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37829 | cpufreq: scpi: Fix null-ptr-deref in scpi_cpufreq_get_rate()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: sun50i: prevent out-of-bounds access

A KASAN enabled kernel reports an out-of-bounds access when handling the
nvmem cell in the sun50i cpufreq driver:
==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sun50i_cpufreq_nvmem_probe+0x180/0x3d4
Read of size 4 at addr ffff000006bf31e0 by task kworker/u16:1/38

This is because the DT specifies the nvmem cell as covering only two
bytes, but we use a u32 pointer to read the value. DTs for other SoCs
indeed specify 4 bytes, so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.

Fortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem
cell, in bytes, so we can use that information to only access the valid
portion of the data.
To cover multiple cell sizes, use memcpy() to copy the information into a
zeroed u32 buffer, then also make sure we always read the data in little
endian fashion, as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37833 | net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37833</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads

Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.

Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to
work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.

For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal
trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries'
ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other
registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value
does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up,
so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the
trap.

I can reproduce this issue with the following steps:

1) When a dirty swapcache page is isolated by reclaim process and the
   page isn't locked, inject memory failure for the page. 
   me_swapcache_dirty() clears uptodate flag and tries to delete from lru,
   but fails.  Reclaim process will put the hwpoisoned page back to lru.

2) The process that maps the hwpoisoned page exits, the page is deleted
   the page will never be freed and will be in the lru forever.

3) If we trigger a reclaim again and tries to reclaim the page,
   add_to_swap() will trigger VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO due to the uptodate flag is
   cleared.

To fix it, skip the hwpoisoned page in shrink_folio_list().  Besides, the
hwpoison folio may not be unmapped by hwpoison_user_mappings() yet, unmap
it in shrink_folio_list(), otherwise the folio will fail to be unmaped by
hwpoison_user_mappings() since the folio isn't in lru list.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 06:51:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3419 | Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin &amp;lt;= 4.0.26 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3419</link><description>The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.26 via the proxy_image() function.

Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&amp;`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:27:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32441 | Rack session gets restored after deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32441</link><description>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0936 | On affected platforms running Arista EOS with a gNMI transport enabled, running the gNOI File TransferToRemote RPC with credentials for a remote server may cause these remote-server credentials to be logged or accounted on the local EOS device or possibly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0936</link><description>On affected platforms running Arista EOS with a gNMI transport enabled, running the gNOI File TransferToRemote RPC with credentials for a remote server may cause these remote-server credentials to be logged or accounted on the local EOS device or possibly on other remote accounting servers (i.e. TACACS, RADIUS, etc).</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 23:08:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-35939 | Craft CMS stores user-provided content session files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-35939</link><description>Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication to the login page and generates a session file on the server at `/var/lib/php/sessions`. Such session files are named `sess_[session_value]`, where `[session_value]` is provided to the client in a `Set-Cookie` response header. Craft CMS stores the return URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location on the server. Craft CMS versions 5.7.5 and 4.15.3 have been released to address this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 22:47:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31644 | Appliance mode BIG-IP iControl REST and tmsh vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31644</link><description>When running in Appliance mode, a command injection vulnerability exists in an undisclosed iControl REST and BIG-IP TMOS Shell (tmsh) command which may allow an authenticated attacker with administrator role privileges to execute arbitrary system commands.

Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:45:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20194 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20194</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform an injection attack against an affected device.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by polling an affected device from a source address that should have been denied. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations from a source that should be denied.
Note: The attacker has no control of the SNMPv3 configuration. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid SNMPv3 user credentials.

Starting in JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.12.1 and prior to version 0.15.4 (corresponding to JRuby versions starting in 9.3.4.0 prior to 9.4.12.1 and 10.0.0.0 prior to 10.0.0.1), when verifying SSL certificates, JRuby-OpenSSL does not verify that the hostname presented in the certificate matches the one the user tries to connect to. This means a man-in-the-middle could just present any valid cert for a completely different domain they own, and JRuby would accept the cert. Anybody using JRuby to make requests of external APIs, or scraping the web, that depends on https to connect securely. JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.15.4 contains a fix for the issue.

net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation

In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
I moved cp-&gt;hash calculation before the first
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp-&gt;alloc_hash is left untouched.
This difference could lead to another out of bound access.

cp-&gt;alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should
update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 13:24:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-33093 | IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-33093</link><description>IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.2.2 JWT secret is stored in public Helm Charts and is not stored as a Kubernetes secret.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 11:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4104 | Frontend Dashboard 1.0 - 2.2.6 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post Function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4104</link><description>The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.6.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39361 | WordPress Royal Elementor Addons plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.1017 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39361</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WProyal Royal Elementor Addons allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Royal Elementor Addons: from n/a through 1.7.1017.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20980 | Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20980</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20937 | Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20937</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20949 | Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20949</link><description>Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privilege of Samsung Members.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20953 | Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20953</link><description>Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20954 | Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitiv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20954</link><description>Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitive information.
