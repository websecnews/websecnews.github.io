Versions 2.11.2 and prior are vulnerable to server-side request forgery and cross-site scripting. This vulnerability enables read access to internal HTTP endpoints but also write access using HTTP POST, PUT, and other methods. Attackers can also use this vulnerability to mask their source IP by forwarding malicious traffic intended for other Internet targets through these open proxies. As of time of publication, no patch is available, but other mitigation strategies are available. Users may avoid exposing the application to the public internet or, if exposing the application to the internet, ensure it is an isolated network with no access to any other internal resources.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 23:28:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28199 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values in Phlex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28199</link><description>phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks. If you render an `&lt;a&gt;` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 22:55:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-46070 | GV-ASManager V6.0.1.0 contains a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in GeoWebServer via Path.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46070</link><description>GV-ASManager V6.0.1.0 contains a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in GeoWebServer via Path.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:45:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1400 | The Mollie Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post or page duplication due to a missing capability check on the duplic...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1400</link><description>The Mollie Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post or page duplication due to a missing capability check on the duplicateForm function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.3.

Each document in Collabora Online is opened by a separate "Kit" instance in a different "jail" with a unique directory "jailID" name. For security reasons, this directory name is randomly generated and should not be given out to the client. In affected versions of Collabora Online it is possible to use the CELL() function, with the "filename" argument, in the spreadsheet component to get a path which includes this JailID. The impact of this vulnerability in its own is low because it requires to be chained with another vulnerability. Users should upgrade to Collabora Online 23.05.9; Collabora Online 22.05.22; Collabora Online 21.11.10 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:38:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27297 | Nix Corruption of fixed-output derivations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27297</link><description>Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. A fixed-output derivations on Linux can send file descriptors to files in the Nix store to another program running on the host (or another fixed-output derivation) via Unix domain sockets in the abstract namespace. This allows to modify the output of the derivation, after Nix has registered the path as "valid" and immutable in the Nix database. In particular, this allows the output of fixed-output derivations to be modified from their expected content. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.3.18 2.18.2 2.19.4 and 2.20.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:31:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27938 | SMTP Smuggling in Postal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27938</link><description>Postal is an open source SMTP server. Postal versions less than 3.0.0 are vulnerable to SMTP Smuggling attacks which may allow incoming e-mails to be spoofed. This, in conjunction with a cooperative outgoing SMTP service, would allow for an incoming e-mail to be received by Postal addressed from a server that a user has 'authorised' to send mail on their behalf but were not the genuine author of the e-mail. Postal is not affected for sending outgoing e-mails as email is re-encoded with `&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;` line endings when transmitted over SMTP. This issue has been addressed and users should upgrade to Postal v3.0.0 or higher. Once upgraded, Postal will only accept End of DATA sequences which are explicitly `&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;`. If a non-compliant sequence is detected it will be logged to the SMTP server log. There are no workarounds for this issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:24:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25854 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sourcecodester Insurance Management System 1.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the Su...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25854</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sourcecodester Insurance Management System 1.0 allows attackers to run arbitrary code via the Subject and Description fields when submitting a support ticket.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28120 | API key leak in codeium-chrome</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28120</link><description>codeium-chrome is an open source code completion plugin for the chrome web browser. The service worker of the codeium-chrome extension doesn't check the sender when receiving an external message.

Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.  Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 19:56:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28198 | XML external entity (XXE) injection in OpenOLAT</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28198</link><description>OpenOlat is an open source web-based e-learning platform for teaching, learning, assessment and communication. By manually manipulating http requests when using the draw.io integration it is possible to read arbitrary files as the configured system user and SSRF. The problem is fixed in version 18.1.6 and 18.2.2. It is advised to upgrade to the latest version of 18.1.x or 18.2.x. Users unable to upgrade may work around this issue by disabling the Draw.io module or the entire REST API which will secure the system.</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 19:49:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2357 | IKEv2 misconfiguration can cause libreswan to abort and restart</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2357</link><description>The Libreswan Project was notified of an issue causing libreswan to restart under some IKEv2 retransmit scenarios when a connection is configured to use PreSharedKeys (authby=secret) and the connection cannot find a matching configured secret.
