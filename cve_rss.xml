usb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()

The variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned long and is
assigned to tpgt-&gt;tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an
integer overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I
haven't tried to trigger it myself, but it is possible to trigger it
by calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.

I modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt-&gt;tport_tpgt and adjusted the
relevant code accordingly.

vhost-vdpa: fix an iotlb memory leak

Before commit 3d5698793897 ("vhost-vdpa: introduce asid based IOTLB")
we called vhost_vdpa_iotlb_unmap(v, iotlb, 0ULL, 0ULL - 1) during
release to free all the resources allocated when processing user IOTLB
messages through vhost_vdpa_process_iotlb_update().
That commit changed the handling of IOTLB a bit, and we accidentally
removed some code called during the release.

We partially fixed this with commit 037d4305569a ("vhost-vdpa: call
vhost_vdpa_cleanup during the release") but a potential memory leak is
still there as showed by kmemleak if the application does not send
VHOST_IOTLB_INVALIDATE or crashes:

      [&lt;00000000986ec465&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd

Let's fix this calling vhost_vdpa_iotlb_unmap() on the whole range in
vhost_vdpa_remove_as(). We move that call before vhost_dev_cleanup()
since we need a valid v-&gt;vdev.mm in vhost_vdpa_pa_unmap().
vhost_iotlb_reset() call can be removed, since vhost_vdpa_iotlb_unmap()
on the whole range removes all the entries.

The kmemleak log reported was observed with a vDPA device that has `use_va`
set to true (e.g. VDUSE). This patch has been tested with both types of
devices.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50739 | fs/ntfs3: Add null pointer check for inode operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50739</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Add null pointer check for inode operations

This adds a sanity check for the i_op pointer of the inode which is
returned after reading Root directory MFT record. We should check the
i_op is valid before trying to create the root dentry, otherwise we may
encounter a NPD while mounting a image with a funny Root directory MFT
record.

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()

Syzkaller reports a long-known leak of urbs in
ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().

The cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb() is called but usb_free_urb()
(or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb-&gt;dev or
urb-&gt;ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns
immediately.

The patch removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev-&gt;tx.tx_buf
because hif_dev-&gt;tx.tx_buf is not supposed to contain urbs which are in
pending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev-&gt;tx.tx_pending).
The tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50741 | media: imx-jpeg: Disable useless interrupt to avoid kernel panic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50741</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Disable useless interrupt to avoid kernel panic

There is a hardware bug that the interrupt STMBUF_HALF may be triggered
after or when disable interrupt.
It may led to unexpected kernel panic.
And interrupt STMBUF_HALF and STMBUF_RTND have no other effect.
So disable them and the unused interrupts.

meanwhile clear the interrupt status when disable interrupt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50742 | misc: ocxl: fix possible refcount leak in afu_ioctl()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50742</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: Fix pcluster memleak when its block address is zero

syzkaller reported a memleak:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=62f37ff612f0021641eda5b17f056f1668aa9aed

unreferenced object 0xffff88811009c7f8 (size 136):

    [] z_erofs_readahead+0x24e/0x580
    [] read_pages+0x86/0x3d0
    ...

syzkaller constructed a case: in z_erofs_register_pcluster(),
ztailpacking = false and map-&gt;m_pa = zero. This makes pcl-&gt;obj.index be
zero although pcl is not a inline pcluster.

Then following path adds refcount for grp, but the refcount won't be put
because pcl is inline.

z_erofs_readahead()
  z_erofs_do_read_page() # for another page
    z_erofs_collector_begin()
      erofs_find_workgroup()
        erofs_workgroup_get()

Since it's illegal for the block address of a non-inlined pcluster to
be zero, add check here to avoid registering the pcluster which would
be leaked.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50744 | scsi: lpfc: Fix hard lockup when reading the rx_monitor from debugfs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50744</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: media: tegra-video: fix device_node use after free

At probe time this code path is followed:

 * tegra_csi_init
   * tegra_csi_channels_alloc
     * for_each_child_of_node(node, channel) -- iterates over channels
       * automatically gets 'channel'
         * tegra_csi_channel_alloc()
           * saves into chan-&gt;of_node a pointer to the channel OF node
       * automatically gets and puts 'channel'
       * now the node saved in chan-&gt;of_node has refcount 0, can disappear
   * tegra_csi_channels_init
     * iterates over channels
       * tegra_csi_channel_init -- uses chan-&gt;of_node

After that, chan-&gt;of_node keeps storing the node until the device is
removed.

of_node_get() the node and of_node_put() it during teardown to avoid any
risk.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50746 | erofs: validate the extent length for uncompressed pclusters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50746</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

syzkaller reported a KASAN use-after-free:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=2ae90e873e97f1faf6f2

The referenced fuzzed image actually has two issues:
 - m_pa == 0 as a non-inlined pcluster;
 - The logical length is longer than its physical length.

The first issue has already been addressed.  This patch addresses
the second issue by checking the extent length validity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50747 | hfs: Fix OOB Write in hfs_asc2mac</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

that case, when the dst reaches the boundary, the srclen is still
greater than 0, which causes a OOB write.
Fix this by adding a check on dstlen in while() before writing to dst

acct: fix potential integer overflow in encode_comp_t()

The integer overflow is descripted with following codes:
  &gt; 317 static comp_t encode_comp_t(u64 value)
  &gt; 318 {
  &gt; 319         int exp, rnd;

  &gt; 342         exp += value;
  &gt; 343         return exp;
  &gt; 344 }

Currently comp_t is defined as type of '__u16', but the variable 'exp' is
type of 'int', so overflow would happen when variable 'exp' in line 343 is
greater than 65535.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50750 | drm/panel/panel-sitronix-st7701: Remove panel on DSI attach failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50750</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because the refcount is not correct in configfs_make_dirent().
For normal stage, the refcount is changing as:

configfs_register_subsystem()
  configfs_create_dir()
    configfs_make_dirent()
      configfs_new_dirent() # set s_count = 1
      dentry-&gt;d_fsdata = configfs_get(sd); # s_count = 2
...
configfs_unregister_subsystem()
  configfs_remove_dir()
    remove_dir()
      configfs_remove_dirent() # s_count = 1
    dput() ...
      *dentry_unlink_inode()*
        configfs_d_iput() # s_count = 0, release

However, if we failed in configfs_create():

configfs_register_subsystem()
  configfs_create_dir()
    configfs_make_dirent() # s_count = 2
    ...
    configfs_create() # fail
    -&gt;out_remove:
    configfs_remove_dirent(dentry)
      configfs_put(sd) # s_count = 1
      return PTR_ERR(inode);

There is no inode in the error path, so the configfs_d_iput() is lost
and makes sd and fragment memory leaked.

To fix this, when we failed in configfs_create(), manually call
configfs_put(sd) to keep the refcount correct.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50752 | md/raid5: Remove unnecessary bio_put() in raid5_read_one_chunk()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50752</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The double free is caused by an unnecessary bio_put() in the

The error path was moved ahead of bio_alloc_clone() in c82aa1b76787c
("md/raid5: move checking badblock before clone bio in
raid5_read_one_chunk"). The previous code checked and freed align_bio
which required a bio_put. After the move that is no longer needed as
raid_bio is returned to the control of the common io path which
performs its own endio resulting in a double free on bad device blocks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50753 | f2fs: fix to do sanity check on summary info</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50753</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The cause of the issue is that brelse() is called on both ofibh.sbh
and ofibh.ebh by udf_find_entry() when it returns NULL.  However,
brelse() is called by udf_rename(), too.  So, b_count on buffer_head
becomes unbalanced.

This patch fixes the issue by not calling brelse() by udf_rename()
when udf_find_entry() returns NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50756 | nvme-pci: fix mempool alloc size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50756</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Convert the max size to bytes to match the units of the divisor that
calculates the worst-case number of PRP entries.

The result is used to determine how many PRP Lists are required. The
code was previously rounding this to 1 list, but we can require 2 in the
worst case. In that scenario, the driver would corrupt memory beyond the
size provided by the mempool.

While unlikely to occur (you'd need a 4MB in exactly 127 phys segments

protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible.
Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and

Since memzero_extent_buffer() will reset "struct btrfs_header" part, we

This call stack is related to two problems.  Firstly, the ocfs2 super uses
"replay_map" to trace online/offline slots, in order to recover offline
slots during recovery and mount.  But when ocfs2_truncate_log_init()
returns an error in ocfs2_mount_volume(), the memory of "replay_map" will
not be freed in error handling path.  Secondly, the memory of "replay_map"
will not be freed if d_make_root() returns an error in ocfs2_fill_super().
But the memory of "replay_map" will be freed normally when completing
recovery and mount in ocfs2_complete_mount_recovery().

Fix the first problem by adding error handling path to free "replay_map"
when ocfs2_truncate_log_init() fails.  And fix the second problem by
calling ocfs2_free_replay_slots(osb) in the error handling path
"out_dismount".  In addition, since ocfs2_free_replay_slots() is static,
it is necessary to remove its static attribute and declare it in header
file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50771 | rcu: Fix __this_cpu_read() lockdep warning in rcu_force_quiescent_state()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50771</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - fix DMA transfer direction

When CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is selected, while running the crypto self
test on the QAT crypto algorithms, the function add_dma_entry() reports
a warning similar to the one below, saying that overlapping mappings
are not supported. This occurs in tests where the input and the output
scatter list point to the same buffers (i.e. two different scatter lists
which point to the same chunks of memory).

The logic that implements the mapping uses the flag DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL
for both the input and the output scatter lists which leads to
overlapped write mappings. These are not supported by the DMA layer.

Fix by specifying the correct DMA transfer directions when mapping
buffers. For in-place operations where the input scatter list
matches the output scatter list, buffers are mapped once with
DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL, otherwise input buffers are mapped using the flag
DMA_TO_DEVICE and output buffers are mapped with DMA_FROM_DEVICE.
Overlapping a read mapping with a write mapping is a valid case in
dma-coherent devices like QAT.
The function that frees and unmaps the buffers, qat_alg_free_bufl()
has been changed accordingly to the changes to the mapping function.

fortify: Fix __compiletime_strlen() under UBSAN_BOUNDS_LOCAL

With CONFIG_FORTIFY=y and CONFIG_UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS=y enabled, we observe
a runtime panic while running Android's Compatibility Test Suite's (CTS)
android.hardware.input.cts.tests. This is stemming from a strlen()
call in hidinput_allocate().

__compiletime_strlen() is implemented in terms of __builtin_object_size(),
then does an array access to check for NUL-termination. A quirk of
__builtin_object_size() is that for strings whose values are runtime
dependent, __builtin_object_size(str, 1 or 0) returns the maximum size
of possible values when those sizes are determinable at compile time.
Example:

  static const char *v = "FOO BAR";
  static const char *y = "FOO BA";
  unsigned long x (int z) {
      // Returns 8, which is:
      // max(__builtin_object_size(v, 1), __builtin_object_size(y, 1))
      return __builtin_object_size(z ? v : y, 1);
  }

So when FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled, the current implementation of
__compiletime_strlen() will try to access beyond the end of y at runtime
using the size of v. Mixed with UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS we get a fault.

hidinput_allocate() has a local C string whose value is control flow
dependent on a switch statement, so __builtin_object_size(str, 1)
evaluates to the maximum string length, making all other cases fault on
the last character check. hidinput_allocate() could be cleaned up to
avoid runtime calls to strlen() since the local variable can only have
literal values, so there's no benefit to trying to fortify the strlen
call site there.

Perform a __builtin_constant_p() check against index 0 earlier in the
macro to filter out the control-flow-dependant case. Add a KUnit test
for checking the expected behavioral characteristics of FORTIFY_SOURCE
internals.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50779 | orangefs: Fix kmemleak in orangefs_prepare_debugfs_help_string()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50779</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix UAF issue in nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() when ops_init() failed

When the ops_init() interface is invoked to initialize the net, but
ops-&gt;init() fails, data is released. However, the ptr pointer in
net-&gt;gen is invalid. In this case, when nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() is invoked
to release the net, invalid address access occurs.

The process is as follows:
setup_net()
	ops_init()
		data = kzalloc(...)   ---&gt; alloc "data"
		net_assign_generic()  ---&gt; assign "date" to ptr in net-&gt;gen
		...
		ops-&gt;init()           ---&gt; failed
		...
		kfree(data);          ---&gt; ptr in net-&gt;gen is invalid
	...
	ops_exit_list()
		...
		nfqnl_nf_hook_drop()
			*q = nfnl_queue_pernet(net) ---&gt; q is invalid

In the above issue, s_usr_quota_inum is set to 5, but inode&lt;5&gt; contains
incorrect imode and disordered extents. Because 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO,
the ext4_ext_check_inode check in the ext4_iget function can be bypassed,
finally, the extents that are not checked trigger the BUG_ON in the
__es_tree_search function. To solve this issue, check whether the inode is
bad_inode in vfs_setup_quota_inode().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50783 | mptcp: use proper req destructor for IPv6</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50783</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Label ATTR_ROOT in ntfs_read_mft() sets is_root = true and

and alloc ni-&gt;dir.alloc_run. However two states are not always

 1) attr_name in ATTR_ROOT does not fit the condition it will set
 is_root = true but NI_FLAG_DIR is not set.
 2) next attr_name in ATTR_ALLOC fits the condition and alloc
 ni-&gt;dir.alloc_run
 3) in cleanup function ni_clear(), when NI_FLAG_DIR is set, it frees
 ni-&gt;dir.alloc_run, otherwise it frees ni-&gt;file.run
 4) because NI_FLAG_DIR is not set in this case, ni-&gt;dir.alloc_run is
 leaked as kmemleak reported:

power: supply: bq27xxx: Fix poll_interval handling and races on remove

Before this patch bq27xxx_battery_teardown() was setting poll_interval = 0
to avoid bq27xxx_battery_update() requeuing the delayed_work item.

There are 2 problems with this:

1. If the driver is unbound through sysfs, rather then the module being
   rmmod-ed, this changes poll_interval unexpectedly

2. This is racy, after it being set poll_interval could be changed
   before bq27xxx_battery_update() checks it through
   /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval

Fix this by added a removed attribute to struct bq27xxx_device_info and
using that instead of setting poll_interval to 0.

There also is another poll_interval related race on remove(), writing
/sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval will requeue
the delayed_work item for all devices on the bq27xxx_battery_devices
list and the device being removed was only removed from that list
after cancelling the delayed_work item.

Fix this by moving the removal from the bq27xxx_battery_devices list
to before cancelling the delayed_work item.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54080 | btrfs: zoned: skip splitting and logical rewriting on pre-alloc write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54080</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: skip splitting and logical rewriting on pre-alloc write

When doing a relocation, there is a chance that at the time of
btrfs_reloc_clone_csums(), there is no checksum for the corresponding
region.

In this case, btrfs_finish_ordered_zoned()'s sum points to an invalid item
and so ordered_extent's logical is set to some invalid value. Then,
btrfs_lookup_block_group() in btrfs_zone_finish_endio() failed to find a
block group and will hit an assert or a null pointer dereference as
following.

This can be reprodcued by running btrfs/028 several times (e.g, 4 to 16
times) with a null_blk setup. The device's zone size and capacity is set to
32 MB and the storage size is set to 5 GB on my setup.

On the zoned mode, writing to pre-allocated region means data relocation
write. Such write always uses WRITE command so there is no need of splitting
and rewriting logical address. Thus, we can just skip the function for the
case.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54081 | xen: speed up grant-table reclaim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54081</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: speed up grant-table reclaim

When a grant entry is still in use by the remote domain, Linux must put
it on a deferred list.  Normally, this list is very short, because
the PV network and block protocols expect the backend to unmap the grant
first.  However, Qubes OS's GUI protocol is subject to the constraints
of the X Window System, and as such winds up with the frontend unmapping
the window first.  As a result, the list can grow very large, resulting
in a massive memory leak and eventual VM freeze.

To partially solve this problem, make the number of entries that the VM
will attempt to free at each iteration tunable.  The default is still
10, but it can be overridden via a module parameter.

This is Cc: stable because (when combined with appropriate userspace
changes) it fixes a severe performance and stability problem for Qubes
OS users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54082 | af_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54082</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().

Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage()
with detailed analysis and a nice repro.

unix_stream_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's
recv queue without locking the queue.

If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is
passed to the peer, there is a loop between them.  If we close both
sockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage
collection.

The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with
FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.

So, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb
locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in
use-after-free.

To avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv
queue.

Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()
refactoring.

This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.

the flush bio.

could fix the flush order issue and do flush optimization later.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54090 | ixgbe: Fix panic during XDP_TX with &amp;gt; 64 CPUs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbe: Fix panic during XDP_TX with &gt; 64 CPUs

Commit 4fe815850bdc ("ixgbe: let the xdpdrv work with more than 64 cpus")
adds support to allow XDP programs to run on systems with more than
64 CPUs by locking the XDP TX rings and indexing them using cpu % 64
(IXGBE_MAX_XDP_QS).

Upon trying this out patch on a system with more than 64 cores,
the kernel paniced with an array-index-out-of-bounds at the return in
ixgbe_determine_xdp_ring in ixgbe.h, which means ixgbe_determine_xdp_q_idx
was just returning the cpu instead of cpu % IXGBE_MAX_XDP_QS.  An example
splat:

I think this is how it happens:

Upon loading the first XDP program on a system with more than 64 CPUs,
ixgbe_xdp_locking_key is incremented in ixgbe_xdp_setup.  However,
immediately after this, the rings are reconfigured by ixgbe_setup_tc.
ixgbe_setup_tc calls ixgbe_clear_interrupt_scheme which calls
ixgbe_free_q_vectors which calls ixgbe_free_q_vector in a loop.
ixgbe_free_q_vector decrements ixgbe_xdp_locking_key once per call if
it is non-zero.  Commenting out the decrement in ixgbe_free_q_vector
stopped my system from panicing.

I suspect to make the original patch work, I would need to load an XDP
program and then replace it in order to get ixgbe_xdp_locking_key back
above 0 since ixgbe_setup_tc is only called when transitioning between
XDP and non-XDP ring configurations, while ixgbe_xdp_locking_key is
incremented every time ixgbe_xdp_setup is called.

Also, ixgbe_setup_tc can be called via ethtool --set-channels, so this
becomes another path to decrement ixgbe_xdp_locking_key to 0 on systems
with more than 64 CPUs.

Since ixgbe_xdp_locking_key only protects the XDP_TX path and is tied
to the number of CPUs present, there is no reason to disable it upon
unloading an XDP program.  To avoid confusion, I have moved enabling
ixgbe_xdp_locking_key into ixgbe_sw_init, which is part of the probe path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54091 | drm/client: Fix memory leak in drm_client_target_cloned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/iommu: Fix notifiers being shared by PCI and VIO buses

fail_iommu_setup() registers the fail_iommu_bus_notifier struct to both
PCI and VIO buses.  struct notifier_block is a linked list node, so this
causes any notifiers later registered to either bus type to also be
registered to the other since they share the same node.

This causes issues in (at least) the vgaarb code, which registers a
notifier for PCI buses.  pci_notify() ends up being called on a vio
device, converted with to_pci_dev() even though it's not a PCI device,
and finally makes a bad access in vga_arbiter_add_pci_device() as
discovered with KASAN:

soundwire: fix enumeration completion

The soundwire subsystem uses two completion structures that allow
drivers to wait for soundwire device to become enumerated on the bus and
initialised by their drivers, respectively.

The code implementing the signalling is currently broken as it does not
signal all current and future waiters and also uses the wrong
reinitialisation function, which can potentially lead to memory
corruption if there are still waiters on the queue.

Not signalling future waiters specifically breaks sound card probe
deferrals as codec drivers can not tell that the soundwire device is
already attached when being reprobed. Some codec runtime PM
implementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration
during resume can also timeout despite the device already having been
enumerated.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54097 | regulator: stm32-pwr: fix of_iomap leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In stm32_pwr_regulator_probe(), base is not released

To fix this issue, replace of_iomap() with
devm_platform_ioremap_resource(). devm_platform_ioremap_resource()
is a specialized function for platform devices.
It allows 'base' to be automatically released whether the probe
function succeeds or fails.

fs: Protect reconfiguration of sb read-write from racing writes

The reconfigure / remount code takes a lot of effort to protect
filesystem's reconfiguration code from racing writes on remounting
read-only. However during remounting read-only filesystem to read-write
mode userspace writes can start immediately once we clear SB_RDONLY
flag. This is inconvenient for example for ext4 because we need to do
some writes to the filesystem (such as preparation of quota files)
before we can take userspace writes so we are clearing SB_RDONLY flag
before we are fully ready to accept userpace writes and syzbot has found
a way to exploit this [1]. Also as far as I'm reading the code
the filesystem remount code was protected from racing writes in the
legacy mount path by the mount's MNT_READONLY flag so this is relatively
new problem. It is actually fairly easy to protect remount read-write
from racing writes using sb-&gt;s_readonly_remount flag so let's just do
that instead of having to workaround these races in the filesystem code.

scsi: qedi: Fix use after free bug in qedi_remove()

In qedi_probe() we call __qedi_probe() which initializes

scsi: lpfc: Prevent lpfc_debugfs_lockstat_write() buffer overflow

A static code analysis tool flagged the possibility of buffer overflow when
using copy_from_user() for a debugfs entry.

Currently, it is possible that copy_from_user() copies more bytes than what
would fit in the mybuf char array.  Add a min() restriction check between
sizeof(mybuf) - 1 and nbytes passed from the userspace buffer to protect
against buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54103 | media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to uncanceled work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Add missing check to block non-AF_CAN binds.

Syzbot created some code which matched the right sockaddr struct size

blk-cgroup: dropping parent refcount after pd_free_fn() is done

Some cgroup policies will access parent pd through child pd even
after pd_offline_fn() is done. If pd_free_fn() for parent is called
before child, then UAF can be triggered. Hence it's better to guarantee
the order of pd_free_fn().

Currently refcount of parent blkg is dropped in __blkg_release(), which
is before pd_free_fn() is called in blkg_free_work_fn() while
blkg_free_work_fn() is called asynchronously.

This patch make sure pd_free_fn() called from removing cgroup is ordered
by delaying dropping parent refcount after calling pd_free_fn() for
child.

BTW, pd_free_fn() will also be called from blkcg_deactivate_policy()
from deleting device, and following patches will guarantee the order.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54108 | scsi: qla2xxx: Fix DMA-API call trace on NVMe LS requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54108</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In kcm_sendmsg(), kcm_tx_msg(head)-&gt;last_skb is used as a cursor to append
newly allocated skbs to 'head'. If some bytes are copied, an error occurred,

The is because damage rectangles computed by
drm_fb_helper_memory_range_to_clip() function is not guaranteed to be
bound in the screen's active display area. Possible reasons are:

1) Buffers are allocated in the granularity of page size, for mmap system
   call support. The shadow screen buffer consumed by fbdev emulation may
   also choosed be page size aligned.

2) The DIV_ROUND_UP() used in drm_fb_helper_memory_range_to_clip()
   will introduce off-by-one error.

For example, on a 16KB page size system, in order to store a 1920x1080
XRGB framebuffer, we need allocate 507 pages. Unfortunately, the size
1920*1080*4 can not be divided exactly by 16KB.

 1920 * 1080 * 4 = 8294400 bytes
 506 * 16 * 1024 = 8290304 bytes
 507 * 16 * 1024 = 8306688 bytes

 line_length = 1920*4 = 7680 bytes

 507 * 16 * 1024 / 7680 = 1081.6

 off / line_length = 507 * 16 * 1024 / 7680 = 1081
 DIV_ROUND_UP(507 * 16 * 1024, 7680) will yeild 1082

memcpy_toio() typically issue the copy line by line, when copy the last
line, out-of-bound access will be happen. Because:

 1082 * line_length = 1082 * 7680 = 8309760, and 8309760 &gt; 8306688

Note that userspace may still write to the invisiable area if a larger
buffer than width x stride is exposed. But it is not a big issue as
long as there still have memory resolve the access if not drafting so
far.

s390/dcssblk: fix kernel crash with list_add corruption

Commit fb08a1908cb1 ("dax: simplify the dax_device &lt;-&gt; gendisk
association") introduced new logic for gendisk association, requiring
drivers to explicitly call dax_add_host() and dax_remove_host().

For dcssblk driver, some dax_remove_host() calls were missing, e.g. in
device remove path. The commit also broke error handling for out_dax case
in device add path, resulting in an extra put_device() w/o the previous
get_device() in that case.

This lead to stale xarray entries after device add / remove cycles. In the
case when a previously used struct gendisk pointer (xarray index) would be
used again, because blk_alloc_disk() happened to return such a pointer, the
xa_insert() in dax_add_host() would fail and go to out_dax, doing the extra
put_device() in the error path. In combination with an already flawed error
handling in dcssblk (device_register() cleanup), which needs to be
addressed in a separate patch, this resulted in a missing device_del() /
klist_del(), and eventually in the kernel crash with list_add corruption on
a subsequent device_add() / klist_add().

Fix this by adding the missing dax_remove_host() calls, and also move the
put_device() in the error path to restore the previous logic.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54118 | serial: sc16is7xx: setup GPIO controller later in probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54118</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix incorrect splitting in btrfs_drop_extent_map_range

In production we were seeing a variety of WARN_ON()'s in the extent_map
code, specifically in btrfs_drop_extent_map_range() when we have to call
add_extent_mapping() for our second split.

Consider the following extent map layout

	PINNED
	[0 16K)  [32K, 48K)

and then we call btrfs_drop_extent_map_range for [0, 36K), with
skip_pinned == true.  The initial loop will have

	start = 0
	end = 36K
	len = 36K

we will find the [0, 16k) extent, but since we are pinned we will skip
it, which has this code

	start = em_end;
	if (end != (u64)-1)
		len = start + len - em_end;

em_end here is 16K, so now the values are

	start = 16K
	len = 16K + 36K - 16K = 36K

len should instead be 20K.  This is a problem when we find the next
extent at [32K, 48K), we need to split this extent to leave [36K, 48k),
however the code for the split looks like this

	split-&gt;start = start + len;
	split-&gt;len = em_end - (start + len);

In this case we have

	em_end = 48K
	split-&gt;start = 16K + 36K       // this should be 16K + 20K
	split-&gt;len = 48K - (16K + 36K) // this overflows as 16K + 36K is 52K

and now we have an invalid extent_map in the tree that potentially
overlaps other entries in the extent map.  Even in the non-overlapping
case we will have split-&gt;start set improperly, which will cause problems
with any block related calculations.

We don't actually need len in this loop, we can simply use end as our
end point, and only adjust start up when we find a pinned extent we need
to skip.

Adjust the logic to do this, which keeps us from inserting an invalid
extent map.

We only skip_pinned in the relocation case, so this is relatively rare,
except in the case where you are running relocation a lot, which can
happen with auto relocation on.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54122 | drm/msm/dpu: Add check for cstate</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54122</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

JFS_SBI(ipbmap-&gt;i_sb)-&gt;bmap wasn't set to NULL after kfree() in
dbUnmount().

Syzkaller uses faultinject to reproduce this KASAN double-free
warning. The issue is triggered if either diMount() or dbMount() fail
in jfs_remount(), since diUnmount() or dbUnmount() already happened in
such a case - they will do double-free on next execution: jfs_umount
or jfs_remount.

Tested on both upstream and jfs-next by syzkaller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54128 | fs: drop peer group ids under namespace lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: drop peer group ids under namespace lock

When cleaning up peer group ids in the failure path we need to make sure
to hold on to the namespace lock. Otherwise another thread might just
turn the mount from a shared into a non-shared mount concurrently.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54129 | octeontx2-af: Add validation for lmac type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54129</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-af: Add validation for lmac type

Upon physical link change, firmware reports to the kernel about the
change along with the details like speed, lmac_type_id, etc.
Kernel derives lmac_type based on lmac_type_id received from firmware.

In a few scenarios, firmware returns an invalid lmac_type_id, which
is resulting in below kernel panic. This patch adds the missing
validation of the lmac_type_id field.

hfs/hfsplus: avoid WARN_ON() for sanity check, use proper error handling

Commit 55d1cbbbb29e ("hfs/hfsplus: use WARN_ON for sanity check") fixed
a build warning by turning a comment into a WARN_ON(), but it turns out
that syzbot then complains because it can trigger said warning with a
corrupted hfs image.

The warning actually does warn about a bad situation, but we are much
better off just handling it as the error it is.  So rather than warn
about us doing bad things, stop doing the bad things and return -EIO.

While at it, also fix a memory leak that was introduced by an earlier
fix for a similar syzbot warning situation, and add a check for one case
that historically wasn't handled at all (ie neither comment nor
subsequent WARN_ON).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54131 | wifi: rt2x00: Fix memory leak when handling surveys</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54131</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

autofs_wait_queue structs should be freed if their wait_ctr becomes zero.
Otherwise they will be lost.

In this case an AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_MULTI ioctl is done, then a new
waitqueue struct is allocated in autofs_wait(), its initial wait_ctr
equals 2. After that wait_event_killable() is interrupted (it returns
-ERESTARTSYS), so that 'wq-&gt;name.name == NULL' condition may be not
satisfied. Actually, this condition can be satisfied when
autofs_wait_release() or autofs_catatonic_mode() is called and, what is
also important, wait_ctr is decremented in those places. Upon the exit of
autofs_wait(), wait_ctr is decremented to 1. Then the unmounting process
begins: kill_sb calls autofs_catatonic_mode(), which should have freed the
waitqueues, but it only decrements its usage counter to zero which is not
a correct behaviour.

edit:imk
This description is of course not correct. The umount performed as a result
of an expire is a umount of a mount that has been automounted, it's not the
autofs mount itself. They happen independently, usually after everything
mounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything
hasn't been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts
in place. But expires done in both cases will result in a notification that
calls autofs_wait_release() with a result status. The problem case is the
summary execution of of the automount daemon. In this case any waiting
processes won't be woken up until either they are terminated or the mount
is umounted.
end edit: imk

So in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which counter becomes zero.

edit: imk
Initially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release() and
autofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can't be the
case (obviously) because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the
list when either of these two functions are called. Consequently the wait
entry will be freed by only one of these functions or by the woken process
in autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls.

maple_tree: fix potential out-of-bounds access in mas_wr_end_piv()

Check the write offset end bounds before using it as the offset into the
pivot array.  This avoids a possible out-of-bounds access on the pivot
array if the write extends to the last slot in the node, in which case the
node maximum should be used as the end pivot.

akpm: this doesn't affect any current callers, but new users of mapletree
may encounter this problem if backported into earlier kernels, so let's
fix it in -stable kernels in case of this.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54136 | serial: sprd: Fix DMA buffer leak issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54136</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/type1: fix cap_migration information leak

Fix an information leak where an uninitialized hole in struct
vfio_iommu_type1_info_cap_migration on the stack is exposed to userspace.

The definition of struct vfio_iommu_type1_info_cap_migration contains a hole as
shown in this pahole(1) output:

  struct vfio_iommu_type1_info_cap_migration {
          struct vfio_info_cap_header header;              /*     0     8 */
          __u32                      flags;                /*     8     4 */

          /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

          __u64                      pgsize_bitmap;        /*    16     8 */
          __u64                      max_dirty_bitmap_size; /*    24     8 */

          /* size: 32, cachelines: 1, members: 4 */
          /* sum members: 28, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
          /* last cacheline: 32 bytes */
  };

The cap_mig variable is filled in without initializing the hole:

  static int vfio_iommu_migration_build_caps(struct vfio_iommu *iommu,
                         struct vfio_info_cap *caps)
  {
      struct vfio_iommu_type1_info_cap_migration cap_mig;

      cap_mig.header.id = VFIO_IOMMU_TYPE1_INFO_CAP_MIGRATION;
      cap_mig.header.version = 1;

      cap_mig.flags = 0;
      /* support minimum pgsize */
      cap_mig.pgsize_bitmap = (size_t)1 &lt;&lt; __ffs(iommu-&gt;pgsize_bitmap);
      cap_mig.max_dirty_bitmap_size = DIRTY_BITMAP_SIZE_MAX;

      return vfio_info_add_capability(caps, &amp;cap;_mig.header, sizeof(cap_mig));
  }

The structure is then copied to a temporary location on the heap. At this point
it's already too late and ioctl(VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO) copies it to userspace
later:

  int vfio_info_add_capability(struct vfio_info_cap *caps,
                   struct vfio_info_cap_header *cap, size_t size)
  {
      struct vfio_info_cap_header *header;

      header = vfio_info_cap_add(caps, size, cap-&gt;id, cap-&gt;version);
      if (IS_ERR(header))
          return PTR_ERR(header);

      memcpy(header + 1, cap + 1, size - sizeof(*header));

      return 0;
  }

This issue was found by code inspection.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54138 | drm/msm: fix NULL-deref on irq uninstall</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54138</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix WARNING in mark_buffer_dirty due to discarded buffer reuse

A syzbot stress test using a corrupted disk image reported that
mark_buffer_dirty() called from __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() or
nilfs_palloc_commit_alloc_entry() may output a kernel warning, and can
panic if the kernel is booted with panic_on_warn.

This is because nilfs2 keeps buffer pointers in local structures for some
metadata and reuses them, but such buffers may be forcibly discarded by
nilfs_clear_dirty_page() in some critical situations.

This issue is reported to appear after commit 28a65b49eb53 ("nilfs2: do
not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only"), but the issue has
potentially existed before.

Fix this issue by checking the uptodate flag when attempting to reuse an
internally held buffer, and reloading the metadata instead of reusing the
buffer if the flag was lost.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54141 | wifi: ath11k: Add missing hw_ops-&amp;gt;get_ring_selector() for IPQ5018</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54141</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If we encounter any error in the vdec_msg_queue_init() then we need

inside the vdec_msg_queue_deinit() function.  However, if the

bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log

It's trivial for user to trigger "verifier log line truncated" warning,
as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at
least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through
this buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:
  - BTF names;
  - BTF.ext source code lines strings.

Verifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state
output. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long enough
in some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will
work correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54146 | x86/kexec: Fix double-free of elf header buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Move representor neigh cleanup to profile cleanup_tx

For IP tunnel encapsulation in ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath) mode, as
the flow is duplicated to the peer eswitch, the related neighbour
information on the peer uplink representor is created as well.

In the cited commit, eswitch devcom unpair is moved to uplink unload
API, specifically the profile-&gt;cleanup_tx. If there is a encap rule
offloaded in ECMP mode, when one eswitch does unpair (because of
unloading the driver, for instance), and the peer rule from the peer
eswitch is going to be deleted, the use-after-free error is triggered
while accessing neigh info, as it is already cleaned up in uplink's
profile-&gt;disable, which is before its profile-&gt;cleanup_tx.

To fix this issue, move the neigh cleanup to profile's cleanup_tx
callback, and after mlx5e_cleanup_uplink_rep_tx is called. The neigh
init is moved to init_tx for symmeter.

net: dsa: avoid suspicious RCU usage for synced VLAN-aware MAC addresses

When using the felix driver (the only one which supports UC filtering
and MC filtering) as a DSA master for a random other DSA switch, one can
see the following stack trace when the downstream switch ports join a
VLAN-aware bridge:

=============================
WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
-----------------------------
net/8021q/vlan_core.c:238 suspicious rcu_dereference_protected() usage!

stack backtrace:
Workqueue: dsa_ordered dsa_slave_switchdev_event_work
Call trace:

 dsa_slave_switchdev_event_work+0x7c/0x1c8
 process_one_work+0x290/0x568

What it's saying is that vlan_for_each() expects rtnl_lock() context and
it's not getting it, when it's called from the DSA master's ndo_set_rx_mode().

The caller of that - dsa_slave_set_rx_mode() - is the slave DSA
interface's dsa_port_bridge_host_fdb_add() which comes from the deferred
dsa_slave_switchdev_event_work().

We went to great lengths to avoid the rtnl_lock() context in that call
path in commit 0faf890fc519 ("net: dsa: drop rtnl_lock from
dsa_slave_switchdev_event_work"), and calling rtnl_lock() is simply not
an option due to the possibility of deadlocking when calling
dsa_flush_workqueue() from the call paths that do hold rtnl_lock() -
basically all of them.

So, when the DSA master calls vlan_for_each() from its ndo_set_rx_mode(),
the state of the 8021q driver on this device is really not protected
from concurrent access by anything.

Looking at net/8021q/, I don't think that vlan_info-&gt;vid_list was
particularly designed with RCU traversal in mind, so introducing an RCU
read-side form of vlan_for_each() - vlan_for_each_rcu() - won't be so
easy, and it also wouldn't be exactly what we need anyway.

In general I believe that the solution isn't in net/8021q/ anyway;
vlan_for_each() is not cut out for this task. DSA doesn't need rtnl_lock()
to be held per se - since it's not a netdev state change that we're
blocking, but rather, just concurrent additions/removals to a VLAN list.
We don't even need sleepable context - the callback of vlan_for_each()
just schedules deferred work.

The proposed escape is to remove the dependency on vlan_for_each() and
to open-code a non-sleepable, rtnl-free alternative to that, based on
copies of the VLAN list modified from .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid() and
.ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54150 | drm/amd: Fix an out of bounds error in BIOS parser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This commit addresses a deadlock situation that can occur in certain

the error queue while receiving a net down event. The deadlock involves
locks in the following order:

3

  j1939_session_activate
  ...
  j1939_sk_queue_activate_next -&gt; sk_session_queue_lock

  lock(&amp;amp;priv-&gt;j1939_socks_lock);

The solution implemented in this commit is to move the

xdp-&gt;frame_sz &gt; PAGE_SIZE check was introduced in commit c8741e2bfe87
("xdp: Allow bpf_xdp_adjust_tail() to grow packet size"). But Jesper
Dangaard Brouer  noted that after introducing the
xdp_init_buff() which all XDP driver use - it's safe to remove this
check. The original intend was to catch cases where XDP drivers have
not been updated to use xdp.frame_sz, but that is not longer a concern
(since xdp_init_buff).

Running the initial syzkaller repro it was discovered that the
contiguous physical memory allocation is used for both xdp paths in
tun_get_user(), e.g. tun_build_skb() and tun_alloc_skb(). It was also
stated by Jesper Dangaard Brouer  that XDP can
work on higher order pages, as long as this is contiguous physical
memory (e.g. a page).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54156 | sfc: fix crash when reading stats while NIC is resetting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54156</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix UAF of alloc-&gt;vma in race with munmap()

[ cmllamas: clean forward port from commit 015ac18be7de ("binder: fix
  UAF of alloc-&gt;vma in race with munmap()") in 5.10 stable. It is needed
  in mainline after the revert of commit a43cfc87caaf ("android: binder:
  stop saving a pointer to the VMA") as pointed out by Liam. The commit
  log and tags have been tweaked to reflect this. ]

In commit 720c24192404 ("ANDROID: binder: change down_write to
down_read") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect
alloc-&gt;vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate
until commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma
from the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the
vma with only the read lock held.

This means that accesses to alloc-&gt;vma in binder_update_page_range() now
will race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown
in the following KASAN trace:

To prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock
inside binder_update_page_range(). One might expect an increase of mmap
lock contention. However, binder already serializes these calls via top
level alloc-&gt;mutex. Also, there was no performance impact shown when
running the binder benchmark tests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54158 | btrfs: don&amp;#x27;t free qgroup space unless specified</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54158</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: don't free qgroup space unless specified

Boris noticed in his simple quotas testing that he was getting a leak
with Sweet Tea's change to subvol create that stopped doing a
transaction commit.  This was just a side effect of that change.

In the delayed inode code we have an optimization that will free extra
reservations if we think we can pack a dir item into an already modified
leaf.  Previously this wouldn't be triggered in the subvolume create
case because we'd commit the transaction, it was still possible but
much harder to trigger.  It could actually be triggered if we did a
mkdir &amp;&amp; subvol create with qgroups enabled.

This occurs because in btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index(), which gets
called when we're adding the dir item, we do the following:

  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info, trans-&gt;block_rsv, bytes, NULL);

if we're able to skip reserving space.

The problem here is that trans-&gt;block_rsv points at the temporary block
rsv for the subvolume create, which has qgroup reservations in the block
rsv.

This is a problem because btrfs_block_rsv_release() will do the
following:

  if (block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved &gt;= block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_size) {
	  qgroup_to_release = block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved -
		  block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_size;
	  block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved = block_rsv-&gt;qgroup_rsv_size;
  }

The temporary block rsv just has -&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved set,
-&gt;qgroup_rsv_size == 0.  The optimization in
btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() sets -&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved = 0.  Then
later on when we call btrfs_subvolume_release_metadata() which has

  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info, rsv, (u64)-1, &amp;amp;qgroup_to_release);
  btrfs_qgroup_convert_reserved_meta(root, qgroup_to_release);

qgroup_to_release is set to 0, and we do not convert the reserved
metadata space.

The problem here is that the block rsv code has been unconditionally
messing with -&gt;qgroup_rsv_reserved, because the main place this is used
is delalloc, and any time we call btrfs_block_rsv_release() we do it
with qgroup_to_release set, and thus do the proper accounting.

The subvolume code is the only other code that uses the qgroup
reservation stuff, but it's intermingled with the above optimization,
and thus was getting its reservation freed out from underneath it and
thus leaking the reserved space.

The solution is to simply not mess with the qgroup reservations if we
don't have qgroup_to_release set.  This works with the existing code as
anything that messes with the delalloc reservations always have
qgroup_to_release set.  This fixes the leak that Boris was observing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:41:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54159 | usb: mtu3: fix kernel panic at qmu transfer done irq handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54159</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sdei_cpuhp_up() is called in the STARTING hotplug section,
which runs with interrupts disabled. Use a CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN entry
instead to execute the cpuhp cb later, with preemption enabled.

SDEI originally got its own cpuhp slot to allow interacting
with perf. It got superseded by pNMI and this early slot is not
relevant anymore. [1]

Some SDEI calls (e.g. SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PE_MASK) take actions on the
calling CPU. It is checked that preemption is disabled for them.
_ONLINE cpuhp cb are executed in the 'per CPU hotplug thread'.
Preemption is enabled in those threads, but their cpumask is limited
to 1 CPU.
Move 'WARN_ON_ONCE(preemptible())' statements so that SDEI cpuhp cb
don't trigger them.

Also add a check for the SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PRIVATE_RESET SDEI call
which acts on the calling CPU.

af_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().

Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage()
with detailed analysis and a nice repro.

unix_stream_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's
recv queue without locking the queue.

If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is
passed to the peer, there is a loop between them.  If we close both
sockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage
collection.

The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with
FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.

So, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb
locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in
use-after-free.

To avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv
queue.

Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()
refactoring.

This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.

In ar5523_probe(), ar5523_host_available() calls ar5523_cmd() as below
(there are other functions which finally call ar5523_cmd()):

ar5523_probe()
-&gt; ar5523_host_available()
   -&gt; ar5523_cmd_read()
      -&gt; ar5523_cmd()

If ar5523_cmd() timed out, then ar5523_host_available() failed and
ar5523_probe() freed the device structure.  So, ar5523_cmd_tx_cb()
might touch the freed structure.

This patch fixes this issue by canceling in-flight tx cmd if submitted
urb timed out.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50717 | nvmet-tcp: add bounds check on Transfer Tag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50717</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/apic: Don't disable x2APIC if locked

The APIC supports two modes, legacy APIC (or xAPIC), and Extended APIC
(or x2APIC).  X2APIC mode is mostly compatible with legacy APIC, but
it disables the memory-mapped APIC interface in favor of one that uses
MSRs.  The APIC mode is controlled by the EXT bit in the APIC MSR.

The MMIO/xAPIC interface has some problems, most notably the APIC LEAK
[1].  This bug allows an attacker to use the APIC MMIO interface to
extract data from the SGX enclave.

Introduce support for a new feature that will allow the BIOS to lock
the APIC in x2APIC mode.  If the APIC is locked in x2APIC mode and the
kernel tries to disable the APIC or revert to legacy APIC mode a GP
fault will occur.

Introduce support for a new MSR (IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS) and handle
the new locked mode when the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED bit is set by
preventing the kernel from trying to disable the x2APIC.

On platforms with the IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS MSR, if SGX or TDX are
enabled the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED will be set by the BIOS.  If
legacy APIC is required, then it SGX and TDX need to be disabled in the
BIOS.

dmaengine: qcom-adm: fix wrong calling convention for prep_slave_sg

The calling convention for pre_slave_sg is to return NULL on error and
provide an error log to the system. Qcom-adm instead provide error
pointer when an error occur. This indirectly cause kernel panic for
example for the nandc driver that checks only if the pointer returned by
device_prep_slave_sg is not NULL. Returning an error pointer makes nandc
think the device_prep_slave_sg function correctly completed and makes
the kernel panics later in the code.

While nandc is the one that makes the kernel crash, it was pointed out
that the real problem is qcom-adm not following calling convention for
that function.

To fix this, drop returning error pointer and return NULL with an error
log.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50722 | media: ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active selection access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50722</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

What the IMGU driver did was that it first acquired the pointers to active

The problem with that approach and a later patch (see Fixes: tag) is that
as sd_state argument to v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop() et al is NULL, there is
now an attempt to dereference that.

It is because the error handling in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init() is wrong.

First, vidtv_bridge_dmx(dev)_init() will clean themselves when fail, but
goto fail_dmx(_dev): calls release functions again, which causes
use-after-free.

Also, in fail_fe, fail_tuner_probe and fail_demod_probe, j = i will cause
out-of-bound when i finished its loop (i == NUM_FE). And the loop
releasing is wrong, although now NUM_FE is 1 so it won't cause problem.

Fix this by correctly releasing everything.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50726 | net/mlx5: Fix possible use-after-free in async command interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50726</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix possible use-after-free in async command interface

mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx should return only after all its callback
handlers were completed. Before this patch, the below race between
mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx and mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler was possible and
lead to a use-after-free:

1. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx is called while num_inflight is 2 (i.e.
   elevated by 1, a single inflight callback).
2. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx decreases num_inflight to 1.
3. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler is called, decreases num_inflight to 0 and
   is about to call wake_up().
4. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx calls wait_event, which returns
   immediately as the condition (num_inflight == 0) holds.
5. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx returns.
6. The caller of mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx frees the mlx5_async_ctx
   object.
7. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler goes on and calls wake_up() on the freed
   object.

Fix it by syncing using a completion object. Mark it completed when
num_inflight reaches 0.

ext4: silence the warning when evicting inode with dioread_nolock

When evicting an inode with default dioread_nolock, it could be raced by
the unwritten extents converting kworker after writeback some new
allocated dirty blocks. It convert unwritten extents to written, the
extents could be merged to upper level and free extent blocks, so it
could mark the inode dirty again even this inode has been marked
I_FREEING. But the inode-&gt;i_io_list check and warning in
ext4_evict_inode() missing this corner case. Fortunately,
ext4_evict_inode() will wait all extents converting finished before this
check, so it will not lead to inode use-after-free problem, every thing
is OK besides this warning. The WARN_ON_ONCE was originally designed
for finding inode use-after-free issues in advance, but if we add
current dioread_nolock case in, it will become not quite useful, so fix
this warning by just remove this check.

crypto: akcipher - default implementation for setting a private key

Changes from v1:
  * removed the default implementation from set_pub_key: it is assumed that
    an implementation must always have this callback defined as there are
    no use case for an algorithm, which doesn't need a public key

Many akcipher implementations (like ECDSA) support only signature
verifications, so they don't have all callbacks defined.

Commit 78a0324f4a53 ("crypto: akcipher - default implementations for
request callbacks") introduced default callbacks for sign/verify
operations, which just return an error code.

However, these are not enough, because before calling sign the caller would
likely call set_priv_key first on the instantiated transform (as the
in-kernel testmgr does). This function does not have a default stub, so the
kernel crashes, when trying to set a private key on an akcipher, which
doesn't support signature generation.

I've noticed this, when trying to add a KAT vector for ECDSA signature to
the testmgr.

With this patch the testmgr returns an error in dmesg (as it should)
instead of crashing the kernel NULL ptr dereference.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50732 | staging: rtl8192u: Fix use after free in ieee80211_rx()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50732</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Correctly set send queue element opcode during immediate work request
flushing in post sendqueue operation, if the QP is in ERROR state.
An undefined ocode value results in out-of-bounds access to an array

in work completion generation. It resulted in a KASAN BUG report
of type 'global-out-of-bounds' during NFSoRDMA testing.

This patch further fixes a potential case of a malicious user which may
write undefined values for completion queue elements status or opcode,

ubifs: Fix memleak when insert_old_idx() failed

Following process will cause a memleak for copied up znode:

dirty_cow_znode
  zn = copy_znode(c, znode);
  err = insert_old_idx(c, zbr-&gt;lnum, zbr-&gt;offs);
  if (unlikely(err))
     return ERR_PTR(err);   // No one refers to zn.

Fetch a reproducer in [Link].

Function copy_znode() is split into 2 parts: resource allocation
and znode replacement, insert_old_idx() is split in similar way,
so resource cleanup could be done in error handling path without
corrupting metadata(mem &amp; disk).
It's okay that old index inserting is put behind of add_idx_dirt(),
old index is used in layout_leb_in_gaps(), so the two processes do
not depend on each other.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54051 | net: do not allow gso_size to be set to GSO_BY_FRAGS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54051</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 ("x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000020081000

ext4: fix invalid free tracking in ext4_xattr_move_to_block()

In ext4_xattr_move_to_block(), the value of the extended attribute
which we need to move to an external block may be allocated by
kvmalloc() if the value is stored in an external inode.  So at the end
of the function the code tried to check if this was the case by
testing entry-&gt;e_value_inum.

However, at this point, the pointer to the xattr entry is no longer
valid, because it was removed from the original location where it had
been stored.  So we could end up calling kvfree() on a pointer which
was not allocated by kvmalloc(); or we could also potentially leak
memory by not freeing the buffer when it should be freed.  Fix this by
storing whether it should be freed in a separate variable.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54063 | fs/ntfs3: Fix OOB read in indx_insert_into_buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54063</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix OOB read in indx_insert_into_buffer

Syzbot reported a OOB read bug:

If the member struct INDEX_BUFFER *index of struct indx_node is
incorrect, that is, the value of __le32 used is greater than the value
of __le32 total in struct INDEX_HDR. Therefore, OOB read occurs when
memmove is called in indx_insert_into_buffer().
Fix this by adding a check in hdr_find_e().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54064 | ipmi:ssif: Fix a memory leak when scanning for an adapter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54064</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The adapter scan ssif_info_find() sets info-&gt;adapter_name if the adapter
info came from SMBIOS, as it's not set in that case.  However, this
function can be called more than once, and it will leak the adapter name
if it had already been set.

net: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access

The probe function sets priv-&gt;chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)
with the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.

However, only realtek-smi actually allocated this chip_data space.
Do likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.

These accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused)
buf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv, which caused kmalloc to
round up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of
value was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox
bootloader port of the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption
becomes quickly apparent.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54066 | media: dvb-usb-v2: gl861: Fix null-ptr-deref in gl861_i2c_master_xfer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54066</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In gl861_i2c_master_xfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf

passed. Malicious data finally reach gl861_i2c_master_xfer. If accessing
msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.
We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.

btrfs: fix race when deleting free space root from the dirty cow roots list

When deleting the free space tree we are deleting the free space root
from the list fs_info-&gt;dirty_cowonly_roots without taking the lock that
protects it, which is struct btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock.
This unsynchronized list manipulation may cause chaos if there's another
concurrent manipulation of this list, such as when adding a root to it
with ctree.c:add_root_to_dirty_list().

This can result in all sorts of weird failures caused by a race, such as
the following crash:

The reproducer was a simple script:

  #!/bin/sh
  for i in `seq 1 5`; do
    modprobe -rv igb
    modprobe -v igb max_vfs=1
    sleep 1
    modprobe -rv igb
  done

It turned out that this could only be reproduce on 82580 (quad and
dual-port), but not on 82576, i350 and i210.  Further debugging showed
that igb_enable_sriov()'s call to pci_enable_sriov() is failing, because
dev-&gt;is_physfn is 0 on 82580.

Prior to commit 50f303496d92 ("igb: Enable SR-IOV after reinit"),
igb_enable_sriov() jumped into the "err_out" cleanup branch.  After this
commit it only returned the error code.

So the cleanup didn't take place, and the incorrect VF setup in the
igb_adapter structure fooled the igb driver into assuming that VFs have
been set up where no VF actually existed.

Fix this problem by cleaning up again if pci_enable_sriov() fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54071 | wifi: rtw88: use work to update rate to avoid RCU warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54071</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Fix potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers

The PCM memory allocation helpers have a sanity check against too many
buffer allocations.  However, the check is performed without a proper
lock and the allocation isn't serialized; this allows user to allocate
more memories than predefined max size.

Practically seen, this isn't really a big problem, as it's more or
less some "soft limit" as a sanity check, and it's not possible to
allocate unlimitedly.  But it's still better to address this for more
consistent behavior.

The patch covers the size check in do_alloc_pages() with the
card-&gt;memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there for
preventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails,
the size is decreased accordingly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:06:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54073 | tpm: Add !tpm_amd_is_rng_defective() to the hwrng_unregister() call site</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54073</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Use correct encap attribute during invalidation

With introduction of post action infrastructure most of the users of encap
attribute had been modified in order to obtain the correct attribute by
calling mlx5e_tc_get_encap_attr() helper instead of assuming encap action
is always on default attribute. However, the cited commit didn't modify
mlx5e_invalidate_encap() which prevents it from destroying correct modify
header action which leads to a warning [0]. Fix the issue by using correct
attribute.

drm/panthor: Prevent potential UAF in group creation

This commit prevents the possibility of a use after free issue in the
GROUP_CREATE ioctl function, which arose as pointer to the group is
accessed in that ioctl function after storing it in the Xarray.
A malicious userspace can second guess the handle of a group and try
to call GROUP_DESTROY ioctl from another thread around the same time
as GROUP_CREATE ioctl.

To prevent the use after free exploit, this commit uses a mark on an
entry of group pool Xarray which is added just before returning from
the GROUP_CREATE ioctl function. The mark is checked for all ioctls
that specify the group handle and so userspace won't be abe to delete
a group that isn't marked yet.

landlock: Fix handling of disconnected directories

Disconnected files or directories can appear when they are visible and
opened from a bind mount, but have been renamed or moved from the source
of the bind mount in a way that makes them inaccessible from the mount
point (i.e. out of scope).

Previously, access rights tied to files or directories opened through a
disconnected directory were collected by walking the related hierarchy
down to the root of the filesystem, without taking into account the
mount point because it couldn't be found. This could lead to
inconsistent access results, potential access right widening, and
hard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot be printed.

For a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to
have write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to
the underlying source of the bind mount, and read access to the related
mount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access
rights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to
inconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be
inherited from the mount point hierarchy, while inheriting permissions
from the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.

Landlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected
directories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the
mount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also always taking
into account the mount point from which these disconnected directories
were opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would
widen access rights [1].

The rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be
visible or accessible to a sandboxed task, relying on the collected
access rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will
not be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison
between the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).
It may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and
directories, but the security policies are always enforced for all the
evaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to
users and safer from an access control perspective.

Remove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and
fix the related comment.

Because opened files have their access rights stored in the related file
security properties, there is no impact for disconnected or unlinked
files.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68737 | arm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68737</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()

In ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to
the rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check
and sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing
extra files to be measured by IMA.

This issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:
After unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA
measurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,
in ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &amp;&amp;
!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In
ima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule
becomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix improper freeing of purex item

In qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated via
qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls
qla24xx_alloc_purex_item().

The qla24xx_alloc_purex_item() function may return a pre-allocated item
from a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead of dynamically
allocating memory with kzalloc().

An error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb() incorrectly uses
kfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated
pool, calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.

Fix this by using the correct deallocation function,
qla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically
allocated and pre-allocated items.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68742 | bpf: Fix invalid prog-&amp;gt;stats access when update_effective_progs fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68742</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix invalid prog-&gt;stats access when update_effective_progs fails

Syzkaller triggers an invalid memory access issue following fault
injection in update_effective_progs. The issue can be described as
follows:

__cgroup_bpf_detach
  update_effective_progs
    compute_effective_progs
      bpf_prog_array_alloc &lt;-- fault inject
  purge_effective_progs
    /* change to dummy_bpf_prog */
    array-&gt;items[index] = &amp;amp;dummy_bpf_prog.prog

---softirq start---
__do_softirq
  ...
    __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb
      __bpf_prog_run_save_cb
        bpf_prog_run
          stats = this_cpu_ptr(prog-&gt;stats)
          /* invalid memory access */
          flags = u64_stats_update_begin_irqsave(&amp;amp;stats-&gt;syncp)
---softirq end---

  static_branch_dec(&amp;amp;cgroup_bpf_enabled_key[atype])

The reason is that fault injection caused update_effective_progs to fail
and then changed the original prog into dummy_bpf_prog.prog in
purge_effective_progs. Then a softirq came, and accessing the members of
dummy_bpf_prog.prog in the softirq triggers invalid mem access.

To fix it, skip updating stats when stats is NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68743 | mshv: Fix create memory region overlap check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68743</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling

When the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)
is excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not
running before the transfer timeout is reached.

While handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and
the message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves
the curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.

To avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this
condition when the IRQ thread is finally run.

While at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new
interrupts can be run.

A better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a
hard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ
thread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the
extra check for a valid transfer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:21:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68747 | drm/panthor: Fix UAF on kernel BO VA nodes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68747</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

To handle errors from loops, clean up partial iterations before doing the
goto.  So add a clk_hw_unregister().
Then use a while (--i &gt;= 0) loop in the unwind section.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50699 | selinux: enable use of both GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC in convert_context()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50699</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It was found that within a critical section of spin_lock_irqsave in
sidtab_context_to_sid(), convert_context() (hooked by
sidtab_convert_params.func) might cause the process to sleep via
allocating memory with GFP_KERNEL, which is problematic.

As Ondrej pointed out [1], convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func
has another caller sidtab_convert_tree(), which is okay with GFP_KERNEL.
Therefore, fix this problem by adding a gfp_t argument for
convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func and pass GFP_KERNEL/_ATOMIC
properly in individual callers.

wifi: ath10k: Delay the unmapping of the buffer

On WCN3990, we are seeing a rare scenario where copy engine hardware is
sending a copy complete interrupt to the host driver while still
processing the buffer that the driver has sent, this is leading into an
SMMU fault triggering kernel panic. This is happening on copy engine
channel 3 (CE3) where the driver normally enqueues WMI commands to the
firmware. Upon receiving a copy complete interrupt, host driver will
immediately unmap and frees the buffer presuming that hardware has
processed the buffer. In the issue case, upon receiving copy complete
interrupt, host driver will unmap and free the buffer but since hardware
is still accessing the buffer (which in this case got unmapped in
parallel), SMMU hardware will trigger an SMMU fault resulting in a
kernel panic.

In order to avoid this, as a work around, add a delay before unmapping
the copy engine source DMA buffer. This is conditionally done for
WCN3990 and only for the CE3 channel where issue is seen.

Below is the crash signature:

wifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix slab-out-of-bounds access in sdio host

SDIO may need addtional 511 bytes to align bus operation. If the tailroom
of this skb is not big enough, we would access invalid memory region.
For low level operation, increase skb size to keep valid memory access in
SDIO host.

In the process of switching USB config from rndis to other config,

hardware encounters a low probability fault, both of them may cause
the -&gt;pullup callback to fail, which will then cause a system panic

net/ieee802154: don't warn zero-sized raw_sendmsg()

syzbot is hitting skb_assert_len() warning at __dev_queue_xmit() [1],
for PF_IEEE802154 socket's zero-sized raw_sendmsg() request is hitting
__dev_queue_xmit() with skb-&gt;len == 0.

Since PF_IEEE802154 socket's zero-sized raw_sendmsg() request was
able to return 0, don't call __dev_queue_xmit() if packet length is 0.

  ----------
  #include socket.h&gt;
  #include in.h&gt;

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    struct sockaddr_in addr = { .sin_family = AF_INET, .sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_LOOPBACK) };
    struct iovec iov = { };
    struct msghdr hdr = { .msg_name = &amp;amp;addr, .msg_namelen = sizeof(addr), .msg_iov = &amp;amp;iov, .msg_iovlen = 1 };
    sendmsg(socket(PF_IEEE802154, SOCK_RAW, 0), &amp;amp;hdr, 0);
    return 0;
  }
  ----------

Note that this might be a sign that commit fd1894224407c484 ("bpf: Don't
redirect packets with invalid pkt_len") should be reverted, for
skb-&gt;len == 0 was acceptable for at least PF_IEEE802154 socket.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50707 | virtio-crypto: fix memory leak in virtio_crypto_alg_skcipher_close_session()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50707</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: avoid uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()

syzbot is reporting uninit value at ath9k_htc_rx_msg() [1], for
ioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_WRITE) can call ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() with
pkt_len = 0 but ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() uses
__dev_alloc_skb(pkt_len + 32, GFP_ATOMIC) based on an assumption that
pkt_len is valid. As a result, ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() allocates skb
with uninitialized memory and ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is reading from
uninitialized memory.

Since bytes accessed by ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is not known until
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is called, it would be difficult to check minimal valid
pkt_len at "if (pkt_len &gt; 2 * MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE) {" line in
ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

We have two choices. One is to workaround by adding __GFP_ZERO so that
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() sees 0 if pkt_len is invalid. The other is to let
ath9k_htc_rx_msg() validate pkt_len before accessing. This patch chose
the latter.

Note that I'm not sure threshold condition is correct, for I can't find
details on possible packet length used by this protocol.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50710 | ice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50710</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: mm: fix VA-range sanity check

Both create_mapping_noalloc() and update_mapping_prot() sanity-check
their 'virt' parameter, but the check itself doesn't make much sense.
The condition used today appears to be a historical accident.

The sanity-check condition:

	if ((virt &gt;= PAGE_END) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

... can only be true for the KASAN shadow region or the module region,
and there's no reason to exclude these specifically for creating and
updateing mappings.

When arm64 support was first upstreamed in commit:

  c1cc1552616d0f35 ("arm64: MMU initialisation")

... the condition was:

	if (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

At the time, VMALLOC_START was the lowest kernel address, and this was
checking whether 'virt' would be translated via TTBR1.

Subsequently in commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... the condition was changed to:

	if ((virt &gt;= VA_START) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

This appear to have been a thinko. The commit moved the linear map to
the bottom of the kernel address space, with VMALLOC_START being at the
halfway point. The old condition would warn for changes to the linear
map below this, and at the time VA_START was the end of the linear map.

Subsequently we cleaned up the naming of VA_START in commit:

  77ad4ce69321abbe ("arm64: memory: rename VA_START to PAGE_END")

... keeping the erroneous condition as:

	if ((virt &gt;= PAGE_END) &amp;&amp; (virt &lt; VMALLOC_START)) {
		[ ... warning here ... ]
		return;
	}

Correct the condition to check against the start of the TTBR1 address
space, which is currently PAGE_OFFSET. This simplifies the logic, and
more clearly matches the "outside kernel range" message in the warning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53990 | SMB3: Add missing locks to protect deferred close file list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53990</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Disallow unallocated resources to be returned

In the event that the topology requests resources that have not been
created by the system (because they are typically not represented in
dpu_mdss_cfg ^1), the resource(s) in global_state (in this case DSC
blocks, until their allocation/assignment is being sanity-checked in
"drm/msm/dpu: Reject topologies for which no DSC blocks are available")
remain NULL but will still be returned out of
dpu_rm_get_assigned_resources, where the caller expects to get an array
containing num_blks valid pointers (but instead gets these NULLs).

To prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences
typically result in a hard-to-debug platform lockup, num_blks shouldn't
increase past NULL blocks and will print an error and break instead.
After all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of
blocks whereas the actual amount varies per platform.

^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended up moving additions to
_dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.

Since commit 3d439b1a2ad3 ("thermal/core: Alloc-copy-free the thermal
zone parameters structure"), thermal_zone_device_register() allocates
a copy of the tzp argument and frees it when unregistering, so
thermal_of_zone_register() now ends up leaking its original tzp and
double-freeing the tzp copy. Fix this by locating tzp on stack instead.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53998 | hwrng: virtio - Fix race on data_avail and actual data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53998</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwrng: virtio - Fix race on data_avail and actual data

The virtio rng device kicks off a new entropy request whenever the
data available reaches zero.  When a new request occurs at the end
of a read operation, that is, when the result of that request is
only needed by the next reader, then there is a race between the
writing of the new data and the next reader.

This is because there is no synchronisation whatsoever between the
writer and the reader.

Fix this by writing data_avail with smp_store_release and reading
it with smp_load_acquire when we first enter read.  The subsequent
reads are safe because they're either protected by the first load
acquire, or by the completion mechanism.

Also remove the redundant zeroing of data_idx in random_recv_done
(data_idx must already be zero at this point) and data_avail in
request_entropy (ditto).</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53999 | net/mlx5e: TC, Fix internal port memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53999</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: TC, Fix internal port memory leak

The flow rule can be splited, and the extra post_act rules are added
to post_act table. It's possible to trigger memleak when the rule
forwards packets from internal port and over tunnel, in the case that,
for example, CT 'new' state offload is allowed. As int_port object is
assigned to the flow attribute of post_act rule, and its refcnt is
incremented by mlx5e_tc_int_port_get(), but mlx5e_tc_int_port_put() is
not called, the refcnt is never decremented, then int_port is never
freed.

The kmemleak reports the following error:

In externel_lb process, the hns3 driver call napi_disable()
first, then the reset happen, then the restore process of the
externel_lb will fail, and will not call napi_enable(). When
doing externel_lb again, napi_disable() will be double call,
cause a deadlock of rtnl_lock().

This patch use the HNS3_NIC_STATE_DOWN state to protect the
calling of napi_disable() and napi_enable() in externel_lb
process, just as the usage in ndo_stop() and ndo_start().</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54001 | staging: r8712: Fix memory leak in _r8712_init_xmit_priv()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54001</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix assertion of exclop condition when starting balance

Balance as exclusive state is compatible with paused balance and device
add, which makes some things more complicated. The assertion of valid
states when starting from paused balance needs to take into account two
more states, the combinations can be hit when there are several threads
racing to start balance and device add. This won't typically happen when
the commands are started from command line.

Scenario 1: With exclusive_operation state == BTRFS_EXCLOP_NONE.

Concurrently adding multiple devices to the same mount point and
btrfs_exclop_finish executed finishes before assertion in
btrfs_exclop_balance, exclusive_operation will changed to
BTRFS_EXCLOP_NONE state which lead to assertion failed:

Scenario 2: With exclusive_operation state == BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED.

Concurrently adding multiple devices to the same mount point and
btrfs_exclop_balance executed finish before the latter thread execute
assertion in btrfs_exclop_balance, exclusive_operation will changed to
BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED state which lead to assertion failed:

udplite: Fix NULL pointer dereference in __sk_mem_raise_allocated().

syzbot reported [0] a null-ptr-deref in sk_get_rmem0() while using
IPPROTO_UDPLITE (0x88):

  14:25:52 executing program 1:
  r0 = socket$inet6(0xa, 0x80002, 0x88)

We had a similar report [1] for probably sk_memory_allocated_add()
in __sk_mem_raise_allocated(), and commit c915fe13cbaa ("udplite: fix
NULL pointer dereference") fixed it by setting .memory_allocated for
udplite_prot and udplitev6_prot.

To fix the variant, we need to set either .sysctl_wmem_offset or
.sysctl_rmem.

Now UDP and UDPLITE share the same value for .memory_allocated, so we
use the same .sysctl_wmem_offset for UDP and UDPLITE.

Example thread interleaving that causes the general protection fault
is as follows:

CPU1 (vmci_host_poll)               CPU2 (vmci_host_do_init_context)
-----                               -----
// Read uninitialized context
context = vmci_host_dev-&gt;context;
                                    // Initialize context
                                    vmci_host_dev-&gt;context = vmci_ctx_create();
                                    vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type = VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT;

if (vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type == VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT) {
    // Dereferencing the wrong pointer
    poll_wait(..., &amp;amp;context-&gt;host_context);
}

In this scenario, vmci_host_poll() reads vmci_host_dev-&gt;context first,
and then reads vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type to check that
vmci_host_dev-&gt;context is initialized. However, since these two reads
are not atomically executed, there is a chance of a race condition as
described above.

To fix this race condition, read vmci_host_dev-&gt;context after checking
the value of vmci_host_dev-&gt;ct_type so that vmci_host_poll() always
reads an initialized context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54008 | virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54008</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally

We try to build affinity mask via create_affinity_masks()
unconditionally which may lead several issues:

- the affinity mask is not used for parent without affinity support
  (only VDUSE support the affinity now)
- the logic of create_affinity_masks() might not work for devices
  other than block. For example it's not rare in the networking device
  where the number of queues could exceed the number of CPUs. Such
  case breaks the current affinity logic which is based on
  group_cpus_evenly() who assumes the number of CPUs are not less than
  the number of groups. This can trigger a warning[1]:

	if (ret &gt;= 0)
		WARN_ON(nr_present + nr_others &lt; numgrps);

Fixing this by only build the affinity masks only when

- Driver passes affinity descriptor, driver like virtio-blk can make
  sure to limit the number of queues when it exceeds the number of CPUs
- Parent support affinity setting config ops

This help to avoid the warning. More optimizations could be done on
top.

i2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path

The cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the
function is entered. This reference is released when the function is
exited. There is currently one error path where the function exits
directly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.

Make sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54010 | ACPICA: ACPICA: check null return of ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED in acpi_db_display_objects</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54010</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix stack overflow when LRO is disabled for virtual interfaces

When the virtual interface's feature is updated, it synchronizes the
updated feature for its own lower interface.
This propagation logic should be worked as the iteration, not recursively.
But it works recursively due to the netdev notification unexpectedly.
This problem occurs when it disables LRO only for the team and bonding
interface type.

       team0
         |
  +------+------+-----+-----+
  |      |      |     |     |
team1  team2  team3  ...  team200

If team0's LRO feature is updated, it generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE
event to its own lower interfaces(team1 ~ team200).
It is worked by netdev_sync_lower_features().
So, the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE notification logic of each lower interface
work iteratively.
But generated NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event is also sent to the upper
interface too.
upper interface(team0) generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event for its own
lower interfaces again.
lower and upper interfaces receive this event and generate this
event again and again.
So, the stack overflow occurs.

But it is not the infinite loop issue.
Because the netdev_sync_lower_features() updates features before
generating the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event.
Already synchronized lower interfaces skip notification logic.
So, it is just the problem that iteration logic is changed to the
recursive unexpectedly due to the notification mechanism.

Reproducer:

ip link add team0 type team
ethtool -K team0 lro on
for i in {1..200}
do
        ip link add team$i master team0 type team
        ethtool -K team$i lro on
done

ethtool -K team0 lro off

In order to fix it, the notifier_ctx member of bonding/team is introduced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54013 | interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54013</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim

For cases where icc_bw_set() can be called in callbaths that could
deadlock against shrinker/reclaim, such as runpm resume, we need to
decouple the icc locking.  Introduce a new icc_bw_lock for cases where
we need to serialize bw aggregation and update to decouple that from
paths that require memory allocation such as node/link creation/
destruction.

This is cause of memory leak. These allocated memory should be
freed in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.

In ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init(), we can save base address of rx_descs

sched/psi: use kernfs polling functions for PSI trigger polling

Destroying psi trigger in cgroup_file_release causes UAF issues when
a cgroup is removed from under a polling process. This is happening
because cgroup removal causes a call to cgroup_file_release while the
actual file is still alive. Destroying the trigger at this point would
also destroy its waitqueue head and if there is still a polling process
on that file accessing the waitqueue, it will step on the freed pointer:

do_select
  vfs_poll
                           do_rmdir
                             cgroup_rmdir
                               kernfs_drain_open_files

  poll_freewait -&gt; UAF access to the trigger's waitqueue head

Patch [1] fixed this issue for epoll() case using wake_up_pollfree(),
however the same issue exists for synchronous poll() case.
The root cause of this issue is that the lifecycles of the psi trigger's
waitqueue and of the file associated with the trigger are different. Fix
this by using kernfs_generic_poll function when polling on cgroup-specific
psi triggers. It internally uses kernfs_open_node-&gt;poll waitqueue head
with its lifecycle tied to the file's lifecycle. This also renders the
fix in [1] obsolete, so revert it.

dmaengine: sf-pdma: pdma_desc memory leak fix

Commit b2cc5c465c2c ("dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a
DMA channel") changed sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy() to unconditionally
allocate a new sf_pdma_desc each time it is called.

The driver previously recycled descs, by checking the in_use flag, only
allocating additional descs if the existing one was in use. This logic
was removed in commit b2cc5c465c2c ("dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread
support for a DMA channel"), but sf_pdma_free_desc() was not changed to
handle the new behaviour.

As a result, each time sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy() is called, the previous
descriptor is leaked, over time leading to memory starvation:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open

The allocation and initialization errors at alloc_midi_urbs() that is
called at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at the
caller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs()
loops only for ep-&gt;num_urbs entries, and since ep-&gt;num_entries wasn't
updated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this
entry won't be released.

The intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so
change the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing
the missed releases.

Also, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at
snd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at
reopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at
the error path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54023 | btrfs: fix race between balance and cancel/pause</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54023</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reproducer is running a balance and a cancel or pause in parallel.
The way balance finishes is a bit wonky, if we were paused we need to
save the balance_ctl in the fs_info, but clear it otherwise and cleanup.
However we rely on the return values being specific errors, or having a
cancel request or no pause request.  If balance completes and returns 0,
but we have a pause or cancel request we won't do the appropriate
cleanup, and then the next time we try to start a balance we'll trip
this ASSERT.

The error handling is just wrong here, we always want to clean up,
unless we got -ECANCELLED and we set the appropriate pause flag in the
exclusive op.  With this patch the reproducer ran for an hour without
tripping, previously it would trip in less than a few minutes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54024 | KVM: Destroy target device if coalesced MMIO unregistration fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54024</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

opp: Fix use-after-free in lazy_opp_tables after probe deferral

When dev_pm_opp_of_find_icc_paths() in _allocate_opp_table() returns

interconnect paths are available.

However, if the OPP table is using required-opps then it may already
have been added to the global lazy_opp_tables list. The error path
does not remove the opp_table from the list again.

This can cause crashes later when the provider of the required-opps
is added, since we will iterate over OPP tables that have already been
freed. E.g.:

iio: core: Prevent invalid memory access when there is no parent

Commit 813665564b3d ("iio: core: Convert to use firmware node handle
instead of OF node") switched the kind of nodes to use for label
retrieval in device registration.  Probably an unwanted change in that
commit was that if the device has no parent then NULL pointer is
accessed.  This is what happens in the stock IIO dummy driver when a
new entry is created in configfs:

  # mkdir /sys/kernel/config/iio/devices/dummy/foo
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: ...
  ...
  Call Trace:
  __iio_device_register
  iio_dummy_probe

Since there seems to be no reason to make a parent device of an IIO
dummy device mandatory, let’s prevent the invalid memory access in
__iio_device_register when the parent device is NULL.  With this
change, the IIO dummy driver works fine with configfs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54028 | RDMA/rxe: Fix the error &amp;quot;trying to register non-static key in rxe_cleanup_task&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix a memory leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps

The LRU and LRU_PERCPU maps allocate a new element on update before locking the
target hash table bucket. Right after that the maps try to lock the bucket.
If this fails, then maps return -EBUSY to the caller without releasing the
allocated element. This makes the element untracked: it doesn't belong to
either of free lists, and it doesn't belong to the hash table, so can't be
re-used; this eventually leads to the permanent -ENOMEM on LRU map updates,
which is unexpected. Fix this by returning the element to the local free list
if bucket locking fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54034 | iommufd: Make sure to zero vfio_iommu_type1_info before copying to user</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54034</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl8xxxu: Fix memory leaks with RTL8723BU, RTL8192EU

The wifi + bluetooth combo chip RTL8723BU can leak memory (especially?)
when it's connected to a bluetooth audio device. The busy bluetooth
traffic generates lots of C2H (card to host) messages, which are not
freed correctly.

To fix this, move the dev_kfree_skb() call in rtl8xxxu_c2hcmd_callback()
inside the loop where skb_dequeue() is called.

The RTL8192EU leaks memory because the C2H messages are added to the
queue and left there forever. (This was fine in the past because it
probably wasn't sending any C2H messages until commit e542e66b7c2e
("wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control"). Since that commit
it sends a C2H message when the TX rate changes.)

To fix this, delete the check for rf_paths &gt; 1 and the goto. Let the
function process the C2H messages from RTL8192EU like the ones from
the other chips.

Theoretically the RTL8188FU could also leak like RTL8723BU, but it
most likely doesn't send C2H messages frequently enough.

This change was tested with RTL8723BU by Erhard F. I tested it with
RTL8188FU and RTL8192EU.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54037 | ice: prevent NULL pointer deref during reload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54037</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_conn: return ERR_PTR instead of NULL when there is no link

hci_connect_sco currently returns NULL when there is no link (i.e. when
hci_conn_link() returns NULL).

sco_connect() expects an ERR_PTR in case of any error (see line 266 in
sco.c). Thus, hcon set as NULL passes through to sco_conn_add(), which
tries to get hcon-&gt;hdev, resulting in dereferencing a NULL pointer as
reported by syzkaller.

The same issue exists for iso_connect_cis() calling hci_connect_cis().

Thus, make hci_connect_sco() and hci_connect_cis() return ERR_PTR
instead of NULL.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:14:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-54039 | can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-54039</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access

In the j1939_tp_tx_dat_new() function, an out-of-bounds memory access
could occur during the memcpy() operation if the size of skb-&gt;cb is
larger than the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This is because the
memcpy() operation uses the size of skb-&gt;cb, leading to a read beyond
the struct j1939_sk_buff_cb.

Updated the memcpy() operation to use the size of struct
j1939_sk_buff_cb instead of the size of skb-&gt;cb. This ensures that the
memcpy() operation only reads the memory within the bounds of struct
j1939_sk_buff_cb, preventing out-of-bounds memory access.

Additionally, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check that the size of skb-&gt;cb
is greater than or equal to the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This
ensures that the skb-&gt;cb buffer is large enough to hold the
j1939_sk_buff_cb structure.

spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans-&gt;len + 1)',
which includes the 1-byte command header.

When copying data from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
as the length is incorrect because:

1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans-&gt;tx_buf' (which has size
   'trans-&gt;len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341-&gt;tx_buf' if 'len' is
   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341-&gt;tx_buf + 1
   overflows the buffer.

Fix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68353 | net: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68353</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Prevent recursive memory reclaim

Function new_inode() returns a new inode with inode-&gt;i_mapping-&gt;gfp_mask
set to GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.  This value includes the __GFP_FS flag, so
allocations in that address space can recurse into filesystem memory
reclaim.  We don't want that to happen because it can consume a
significant amount of stack memory.

Worse than that is that it can also deadlock: for example, in several
places, gfs2_unstuff_dinode() is called inside filesystem transactions.
This calls filemap_grab_folio(), which can allocate a new folio, which
can trigger memory reclaim.  If memory reclaim recurses into the
filesystem and starts another transaction, a deadlock will ensue.

To fix these kinds of problems, prevent memory reclaim from recursing
into filesystem code by making sure that the gfp_mask of inode address
spaces doesn't include __GFP_FS.

The "meta" and resource group address spaces were already using GFP_NOFS
as their gfp_mask (which doesn't include __GFP_FS).  The default value
of GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is less restrictive than GFP_NOFS, though.  To
avoid being overly limiting, use the default value and only knock off
the __GFP_FS flag.  I'm not sure if this will actually make a
difference, but it also shouldn't hurt.

This patch is loosely based on commit ad22c7a043c2 ("xfs: prevent stack
overflows from page cache allocation").

Fixes xfstest generic/273.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68357 | iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68357</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix racy bitfield write in btrfs_clear_space_info_full()

From the memory-barriers.txt document regarding memory barrier ordering
guarantees:

 (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often
     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write
     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel
     algorithms.

 (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields
     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields
     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's
     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one
     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.

btrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of
the fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush:

struct btrfs_space_info {
        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info;              /*     0     8 */
        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent;               /*     8     8 */
        ...
        int                        clamp;                /*   172     4 */
        unsigned int               full:1;               /*   176: 0  4 */
        unsigned int               chunk_alloc:1;        /*   176: 1  4 */
        unsigned int               flush:1;              /*   176: 2  4 */
        ...

Therefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to
one of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the
bitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and
writes out found-&gt;full = 0 without a lock.

Imagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we
finished deleting a block_group and are thus calling
btrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim
ticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space():

          T1                                             T2
btrfs_commit_transaction
  btrfs_clear_space_info_full
  data_sinfo-&gt;full = 0
  READ: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)
                                              spin_lock(&amp;amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                              if(list_empty(tickets))
                                                space_info-&gt;flush = 0;
                                                READ: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1
                                                MOD/WRITE: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:0
                                                spin_unlock(&amp;amp;space_info-&gt;lock);
                                                return;
  MOD/WRITE: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1

and now data_sinfo-&gt;flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This
breaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or
running. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go
into __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info-&gt;tickets but will
see space_info-&gt;flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,
they will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible
to kick the worker again.

I also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that
it is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,
the assembly is:
  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)
and similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0:
  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)

So I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed
a number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to
reproduce it.

Rather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take
advantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that
it is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to
bools. This avoids writes to space_info-&gt;full having any effect on

btrfs: fix double free of qgroup record after failure to add delayed ref head

In the previous code it was possible to incur into a double kfree()
scenario when calling add_delayed_ref_head(). This could happen if the
record was reported to already exist in the
btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error
later on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since
add_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the
record. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer
to NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object
which was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.

The problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the
object is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the
fix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of
the add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()
the given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to
act on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the
'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the
tracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'
boolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object
only if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the
tracing logic.

As a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that
'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the
function, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert
happens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid
value on an early exit.

The documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated
to reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68360 | wifi: mt76: wed: use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68360</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()

by subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer.
However, it does not validate if the received packet

If a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer
underflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,

bpf: Check skb-&gt;transport_header is set in bpf_skb_check_mtu

The bpf_skb_check_mtu helper needs to use skb-&gt;transport_header when
the BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS flag is used:

	bpf_skb_check_mtu(skb, ifindex, &amp;amp;mtu_len, 0, BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS)

The transport_header is not always set. There is a WARN_ON_ONCE
report when CONFIG_DEBUG_NET is enabled + skb-&gt;gso_size is set +
bpf_prog_test_run is used:

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2216 at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:3071

 bpf_prog_3920e25740a41171_tc_chk_segs_flag # A test in the next patch
 bpf_test_run
 bpf_prog_test_run_skb

For a normal ingress skb (not test_run), skb_reset_transport_header
is performed but there is plan to avoid setting it as described in
commit 2170a1f09148 ("net: no longer reset transport_header in __netif_receive_skb_core()").

This patch fixes the bpf helper by checking
skb_transport_header_was_set(). The check is done just before
skb-&gt;transport_header is used, to avoid breaking the existing bpf prog.
The WARN_ON_ONCE is limited to bpf_prog_test_run, so targeting bpf-next.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68364 | ocfs2: relax BUG() to ocfs2_error() in __ocfs2_move_extent()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68364</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal

Correct possible race conditions during device removal.

Previously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute
after the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other
resource access issues.

This race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN
reset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to
use-after-free and improper access to freed resources.

  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in
    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset
    is skipped.

  - Cancel any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().

  - Ensure device freeing in sdev_destroy() is done while holding the
    LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68372 | nbd: defer config put in recv_work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68372</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: defer config put in recv_work

There is one uaf issue in recv_work when running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK and

Commit 87aac3a80af5 ("nbd: call nbd_config_put() before notifying the
waiter") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in
recv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not
be woken up while nbd-&gt;task_recv was still uncleared.

However, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly
calls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.
Therefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.

Move nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is
held for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the
config cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear
+ reconfigure interleave.

In addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last
nbd_put (which causes deadlock):

path A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_disconnect_and_put
        flush_workqueue // recv_work done
      nbd_config_put
        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0
        queue_work

path B (netlink without NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=2 (trigger recv_work)

4. rdev remove path calls del_gendisk because MD_DELETED is set
5. md stop path release reconfig_mutex and calls del_gendisk again

So there is a race condition we should resolve. This patch adds a

perf/x86: Fix NULL event access and potential PEBS record loss

When intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() is called to drain PEBS records, the
perf_event_overflow() could be called to process the last PEBS record.

While perf_event_overflow() could trigger the interrupt throttle and
stop all events of the group, like what the below call-chain shows.

perf_event_overflow()
  -&gt; __perf_event_overflow()
    -&gt;__perf_event_account_interrupt()
      -&gt; perf_event_throttle_group()
        -&gt; perf_event_throttle()
          -&gt; event-&gt;pmu-&gt;stop()
            -&gt; x86_pmu_stop()

The side effect of stopping the events is that all corresponding event
pointers in cpuc-&gt;events[] array are cleared to NULL.

Assume there are two PEBS events (event a and event b) in a group. When
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() calls perf_event_overflow() to process the
last PEBS record of PEBS event a, interrupt throttle is triggered and
all pointers of event a and event b are cleared to NULL. Then
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() tries to process the last PEBS record of
event b and encounters NULL pointer access.

To avoid this issue, move cpuc-&gt;events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop()
to x86_pmu_del(). It's safe since cpuc-&gt;active_mask or
cpuc-&gt;pebs_enabled is always checked before access the event pointer
from cpuc-&gt;events[].</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:43:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68376 | coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68376</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment

In ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is sent to
firmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,
which goes against firmwire's definition.

While connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not
supported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff
is assigned to he_mcs-&gt;rx_mcs_set field.

	Ext Tag: HE Capabilities
	    [...]
	    Supported HE-MCS and NSS Set
		[...]
	        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz
		    [...]
	            Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff

Swap the assignment to fix this issue.

As the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it
needs to go via he_mcs-&gt;rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping
done, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.

bpf: Do not let BPF test infra emit invalid GSO types to stack

Yinhao et al. reported that their fuzzer tool was able to trigger a
skb_warn_bad_offload() from netif_skb_features() -&gt; gso_features_check().
When a BPF program - triggered via BPF test infra - pushes the packet
to the loopback device via bpf_clone_redirect() then mentioned offload
warning can be seen. GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.

We get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting
gso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense
that this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due
to the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy
through setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific
assumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further
into the GSO engine in the first place.

The checks were added in 121d57af308d ("gso: validate gso_type in GSO
handlers") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine
a protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such
packets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via
netif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs
could be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be
an additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given
bpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit
such packets, lets reject them right there.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:44:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68726 | crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68726</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling

Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg")
introduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type
specific reqsize fields. It looks like this was introduced specifically
for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent commits
add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.

However, this is being recommended for use in all crypto algs
instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
cra_reqsize in aead algorithms, hence, causes memory corruptions and
crashes as the underlying functions in the algorithm framework have not
been updated to set the reqsize properly from cra_reqsize. [1]

Add proper set_reqsize calls in the aead init function to properly
initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.

ntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be

uptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a
buffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record

wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path

Currently, packets received on the REO exception ring from
unassociated peers are of MSDU buffer type, while the driver expects
link descriptor type packets. These packets are not parsed further due
to a return check on packet type in ath12k_hal_desc_reo_parse_err(),
but the associated skb is not freed. This may lead to kernel
crashes and buffer leaks.

Hence to fix, update the RX error handler to explicitly drop
MSDU buffer type packets received on the REO exception ring.
This prevents further processing of invalid packets and ensures
stability in the RX error handling path.
