A vulnerability in CraftCMS allows an attacker to bypass local file system validation by utilizing a double file:// scheme (e.g., file://file:////). This enables the attacker to specify sensitive folders as the file system, leading to potential file overwriting through malicious uploads, unauthorized access to sensitive files, and, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE) via Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) payloads. Note that this will only work if you have an authenticated administrator account with allowAdminChanges enabled. This is fixed in 5.4.6 and 4.12.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:32:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52292 | Craft Allows Attackers to Read Arbitrary System Files</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52292</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS). The dataUrl function can be exploited if an attacker has write permissions on system notification templates. This function accepts an absolute file path, reads the file's content, and converts it into a Base64-encoded string. By embedding this function within a system notification template, the attacker can exfiltrate the Base64-encoded file content through a triggered system email notification. Once the email is received, the Base64 payload can be decoded, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. This is fixed in 5.4.9 and 4.12.8.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:32:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9413 | The transport_message_handler function in SCP-Firmware release versions 2.11.0-2.15.0 does not properly handle errors, potentially allowing ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9413</link><description>The transport_message_handler function in SCP-Firmware release versions 2.11.0-2.15.0 does not properly handle errors, potentially allowing an Application Processor (AP) to cause a buffer overflow in System Control Processor (SCP) firmware.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:32:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52293 | Craft has a Potential Remote Code Execution via missing path normalization &amp;amp; Twig SSTI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52293</link><description>Craft is a content management system (CMS).

memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 10:36:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8001 | VIWIS LMS Print authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8001</link><description>A vulnerability was found in VIWIS LMS 9.11.

A command injection vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the host. Zoraxy has a Web SSH terminal feature that allows authenticated users to connect to SSH servers from their browsers. In HandleCreateProxySession the request to create an SSH session is handled. An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because, unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7571 | Incorrect permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before 22.7R4 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7571</link><description>Incorrect permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before 22.7R4 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8539 | Improper authorization in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.7R3 allows a local authenticated attacker to modify sensitive config...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8539</link><description>Improper authorization in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.7R3 allows a local authenticated attacker to modify sensitive configuration files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9842 | Incorrect permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.7R4 allows a local authenticated attacker to create arbitrary folders...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9842</link><description>Incorrect permissions in Ivanti Secure Access Client before version 22.7R4 allows a local authenticated attacker to create arbitrary folders.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9843 | A buffer over-read in Ivanti Secure Access Client before 22.7R4 allows a local unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9843</link><description>A buffer over-read in Ivanti Secure Access Client before 22.7R4 allows a local unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11007 | Command injection in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.1 allows a remote authenti...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11007</link><description>Command injection in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.1 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.1 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47905 | A stack-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2 allows a rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47905</link><description>A stack-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47906 | Excessive binary privileges in Ivanti Connect Secure which affects versions 22.4R2 through 22.7R2.2 inclusive within the R2 release line and...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47906</link><description>Excessive binary privileges in Ivanti Connect Secure which affects versions 22.4R2 through 22.7R2.2 inclusive within the R2 release line and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2 allow a local authenticated attacker to escalate privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47907 | A stack-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47907</link><description>A stack-based buffer overflow in IPsec of Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-47909 | A stack-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2 allows a rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47909</link><description>A stack-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.3 and Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:22:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52296 | libosdp has a null pointer deref in osdp_reply_name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52296</link><description>libosdp is an implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol) and provides a C library with support for C++, Rust and Python3.

Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.


Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue. 

Additionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully."; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf "\n\n"; done
For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info."; qemu-img info -U $file; printf "\n\n"; done</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:40:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11124 | TimGeyssens UIOMatic uioMaticObject.r sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11124</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in TimGeyssens UIOMatic 5 and classified as critical.
