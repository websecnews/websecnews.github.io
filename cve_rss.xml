Third-party applications may be able to access some endpoints or Websocket APIs that are incorrectly specified as [kind](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L811) or [secure](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L805) without the user's permission and perform operations such as reading or adding non-public content. As a result, if the user who authenticated the application is an administrator, confidential information such as object storage secret keys and SMTP server passwords will be leaked, and general users can also create invitation codes without permission and leak non-public user information. This is patched in version [2023.12.1](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/c96bc36fedc804dc840ea791a9355d7df0748e64).</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 17:31:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52137 | GitHub Action tj-actions/verify-changed-files is vulnerable to command injection in output filenames</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52137</link><description>The [`tj-actions/verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) action allows for command injection in changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets. The [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands, an attacker may be able to steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`.

This has been patched in versions [17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling `safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special characters for bash environments.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 17:20:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51663 | Hail authentication can be bypassed by changing email address</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51663</link><description>Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data. Hail relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) email addresses from ID tokens to verify the validity of a user's domain, but because users have the ability to change their email address, they could create accounts and use resources in clusters that they should not have access to. For example, a user could create a Microsoft or Google account and then change their email to `test@example.org`. This account can then be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is `example.org`. The attacker is not able to access private data or impersonate another user, but they would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are enabled and create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory Administrator access.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-17163 | Visual Studio Code Python Extension Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-17163</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 16:39:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51527 | WordPress GPT3 AI Content Writer Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.8.2 is vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51527</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Senol Sahin AI Power: Complete AI Pack – Powered by GPT-4.This issue affects AI Power: Complete AI Pack – Powered by GPT-4: from n/a through 1.8.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 15:18:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51688 | WordPress eCommerce Product Catalog Plugin &amp;lt;= 3.3.26 is vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51688</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in impleCode eCommerce Product Catalog Plugin for WordPress.This issue affects eCommerce Product Catalog Plugin for WordPress: from n/a through 3.3.26.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 14:58:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51517 | WordPress Calculated Fields Form Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.28 is vulnerable to Open Redirection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51517</link><description>URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in CodePeople Calculated Fields Form.This issue affects Calculated Fields Form: from n/a through 1.2.28.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 14:58:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51687 | WordPress Product Catalog Simple Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.6 is vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51687</link><description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in impleCode Product Catalog Simple.This issue affects Product Catalog Simple: from n/a through 1.7.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 14:58:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4675 | SQLi i GM Informatics MDO</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4675</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in GM Information Technologies MDO allows SQL Injection.This issue affects MDO: through 20231229.

Several URI Schemes are defined for this purpose.

Links can be activated by clicks, or by automatic document events.

The execution of such links must be subject to user approval.

In the affected versions of OpenOffice, approval for certain links is not requested; when activated, such links could therefore result in arbitrary script execution.

This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.

This issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default as of wrangler@3.16.0, an  SSRF vulnerability in miniflare https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7  (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2 introduced validation for the Origin/Host headers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:31:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7078 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Miniflare</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7078</link><description>Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server.

Prior to 0.2.0, the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 15:40:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7129 | code-projects Voting System Voters Login sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7129</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in code-projects Voting System 1.0.
