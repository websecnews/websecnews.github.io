An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.

Users are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 10:15:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39923 | dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT error handling for num-channels/ees</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39923</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT error handling for num-channels/ees

When we don't have a clock specified in the device tree, we have no way to
ensure the BAM is on. This is often the case for remotely-controlled or
remotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channels
from the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.

However, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and without
num-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missing
return statements. The driver will then later try to read the number of
channels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on boot
firmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of proper
error handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,
causing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].

Avoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT
properties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs
upstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,
clearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the
kernel log was just ignored. It's safer to disable the crypto engine for
these broken DTBs.

can: j1939: implement NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler

syzbot is reporting

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2

problem, for j1939 protocol did not have NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification
handler for undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind().

Commit 25fe97cb7620 ("can: j1939: move j1939_priv_put() into sk_destruct
callback") expects that a call to j1939_priv_put() can be unconditionally
delayed until j1939_sk_sock_destruct() is called. But we need to call
j1939_priv_put() against an extra ref held by j1939_sk_bind() call
(as a part of undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind()) as soon as
NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification fires (i.e. before j1939_sk_sock_destruct()
is called via j1939_sk_release()). Otherwise, the extra ref on "struct
j1939_priv" held by j1939_sk_bind() call prevents "struct net_device" from
dropping the usage count to 1; making it impossible for
unregister_netdevice() to continue.

genetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM

Per family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced to allow families
to track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop
producing events depending on listeners.

However, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even if
capability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that
callbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the
syscall still returned failure to user space.

Fix this by only invoking bind() after "if (ret) break;" check
i.e. after permission checks have succeeded.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 08:13:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39927 | ceph: fix race condition validating r_parent before applying state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39927</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix race condition validating r_parent before applying state

Add validation to ensure the cached parent directory inode matches the
directory info in MDS replies. This prevents client-side race conditions
where concurrent operations (e.g. rename) cause r_parent to become stale
between request initiation and reply processing, which could lead to
applying state changes to incorrect directory inodes.

[ idryomov: folded a kerneldoc fixup and a follow-up fix from Alex to
  move CEPH_CAP_PIN reference when r_parent is updated:

  When the parent directory lock is not held, req-&gt;r_parent can become
  stale and is updated to point to the correct inode.  However, the
  associated CEPH_CAP_PIN reference was not being adjusted.  The
  CEPH_CAP_PIN is a reference on an inode that is tracked for
  accounting purposes.  Moving this pin is important to keep the
  accounting balanced. When the pin was not moved from the old parent
  to the new one, it created two problems: The reference on the old,
  stale parent was never released, causing a reference leak.
  A reference for the new parent was never acquired, creating the risk
  of a reference underflow later in ceph_mdsc_release_request().  This
  patch corrects the logic by releasing the pin from the old parent and
  acquiring it for the new parent when r_parent is switched.  This
  ensures reference accounting stays balanced. ]</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 08:13:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39928 | i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39928</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range

Add an explicit check for the xfer length to 'rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'
to ensure the data length isn't within the supported range. In
particular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and
causes unintended or destructive behaviour.

This limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register
documentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value
of these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of
1 &lt;= len &lt;= 16.

Affected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data
length of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value
due to:

(len - 1) &amp; 0xf

and effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.
This causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For
example, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks
them by overwriting some initial bytes.

For completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.

pcmcia: Add error handling for add_interval() in do_validate_mem()

In the do_validate_mem(), the call to add_interval() does not
handle errors. If kmalloc() fails in add_interval(), it could
result in a null pointer being inserted into the linked list,
leading to illegal memory access when sub_interval() is called
next.

This patch adds an error handling for the add_interval(). If
add_interval() returns an error, the function will return early

spi: microchip-core-qspi: stop checking viability of op-&gt;max_freq in supports_op callback

In commit 13529647743d9 ("spi: microchip-core-qspi: Support per spi-mem
operation frequency switches") the logic for checking the viability of
op-&gt;max_freq in mchp_coreqspi_setup_clock() was copied into
mchp_coreqspi_supports_op(). Unfortunately, op-&gt;max_freq is not valid
when this function is called during probe but is instead zero.
Accordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division
by zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.

Seemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a
modification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq
capability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 08:13:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39922 | ixgbe: fix incorrect map used in eee linkmode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39922</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: kexec: initialize kexec_buf struct in load_other_segments()

Patch series "kexec: Fix invalid field access".

The kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization. 
commit bf454ec31add ("kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly")
added a field that is always read but not consistently populated by all
architectures.  This un-initialized field will contain garbage.

This is also triggering a UBSAN warning when the uninitialized data was
accessed:

	------------[ cut here ]------------
	UBSAN: invalid-load in ./include/linux/kexec.h:210:10
	load of value 252 is not a valid value for type '_Bool'

Zero-initializing kexec_buf at declaration ensures all fields are cleanly
set, preventing future instances of uninitialized memory being used.

An initial fix was already landed for arm64[0], and this patchset fixes
the problem on the remaining arm64 code and on riscv, as raised by Mark.

Discussions about this problem could be found at[1][2].

net: phylink: add lock for serializing concurrent pl-&gt;phydev writes with resolver

Currently phylink_resolve() protects itself against concurrent
phylink_bringup_phy() or phylink_disconnect_phy() calls which modify
pl-&gt;phydev by relying on pl-&gt;state_mutex.

The problem is that in phylink_resolve(), pl-&gt;state_mutex is in a lock
inversion state with pl-&gt;phydev-&gt;lock. So pl-&gt;phydev-&gt;lock needs to be
acquired prior to pl-&gt;state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing
pl-&gt;phydev in the first place, and without pl-&gt;state_mutex, that is
racy.

Hence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it
will serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&amp;amp;phy-&gt;lock) will be
moved outside of the mutex_lock(&amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex) section.

Another alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()
acquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()
and phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()
runs under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when
calling flush_work(&amp;amp;pl-&gt;resolve). Additionally, it would have been
undesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call
paths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was
preferred.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:53:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39906 | drm/amd/display: remove oem i2c adapter on finish</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39906</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

external gfp_mask.  To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and
GFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate
memalloc scope.

xfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.

There was a report here
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com

This patch:
 - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;
 - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();
 - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()
   around apply_to_page_range();
 - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:53:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39911 | i40e: fix IRQ freeing in i40e_vsi_request_irq_msix error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39911</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp_bpf: Call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict() fails to allocate psock-&gt;cork.

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

The repro does the following:

  1. Load a sk_msg prog that calls bpf_msg_cork_bytes(msg, cork_bytes)
  2. Attach the prog to a SOCKMAP
  3. Add a socket to the SOCKMAP
  4. Activate fault injection
  5. Send data less than cork_bytes

At 5., the data is carried over to the next sendmsg() as it is
smaller than the cork_bytes specified by bpf_msg_cork_bytes().

Then, tcp_bpf_send_verdict() tries to allocate psock-&gt;cork to hold
the data, but this fails silently due to fault injection + __GFP_NOWARN.

If the allocation fails, we need to revert the sk-&gt;sk_forward_alloc
change done by sk_msg_alloc().

Let's call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict fails to allocate
psock-&gt;cork.

The "*copied" also needs to be updated such that a proper error can
be returned to the caller, sendmsg. It fails to allocate psock-&gt;cork.
Nothing has been corked so far, so this patch simply sets "*copied"
to 0.

   and register sched_switch tracepoint.
2. echo ' ' &gt;&gt; set_event_pid, and perform fault injection during chunk
   allocation of trace_pid_list_alloc. Let pid_list with no pid and
assign to tr-&gt;filtered_pids.
3. echo ' ' &gt;&gt; set_event_pid. Let pid_list is NULL and assign to
   tr-&gt;filtered_pids.
4. echo 9 &gt;&gt; set_event_pid, will trigger the double register
   sched_switch tracepoint warning.

The reason is that syzkaller injects a fault into the chunk allocation
in trace_pid_list_alloc, causing a failure in trace_pid_list_set, which
may trigger double register of the same tracepoint. This only occurs
when the system is about to crash, but to suppress this warning, let's
add failure handling logic to trace_pid_list_set.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:53:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39915 | net: phy: transfer phy_config_inband() locking responsibility to phylink</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39915</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: transfer phy_config_inband() locking responsibility to phylink

Problem description
===================

Lockdep reports a possible circular locking dependency (AB/BA) between
&amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex and &amp;amp;phy-&gt;lock, as follows.

phylink_resolve() // acquires &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex
-&gt; phylink_major_config()
   -&gt; phy_config_inband() // acquires &amp;amp;pl-&gt;phydev-&gt;lock

whereas all the other call sites where &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex and
&amp;amp;pl-&gt;phydev-&gt;lock have the locking scheme reversed. Everywhere else,
&amp;amp;pl-&gt;phydev-&gt;lock is acquired at the top level, and &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex at
the lower level. A clear example is phylink_bringup_phy().

The outlier is the newly introduced phy_config_inband() and the existing
lock order is the correct one. To understand why it cannot be the other
way around, it is sufficient to consider phylink_phy_change(), phylink's
callback from the PHY device's phy-&gt;phy_link_change() virtual method,
invoked by the PHY state machine.

phy_link_up() and phy_link_down(), the (indirect) callers of
phylink_phy_change(), are called with &amp;amp;phydev-&gt;lock acquired.
Then phylink_phy_change() acquires its own &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex, to
serialize changes made to its pl-&gt;phy_state and pl-&gt;link_config.
So all other instances of &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex and &amp;amp;phydev-&gt;lock must be
consistent with this order.

Problem impact
==============

I think the kernel runs a serious deadlock risk if an existing
phylink_resolve() thread, which results in a phy_config_inband() call,
is concurrent with a phy_link_up() or phy_link_down() call, which will
deadlock on &amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex in phylink_phy_change(). Practically
speaking, the impact may be limited by the slow speed of the medium
auto-negotiation protocol, which makes it unlikely for the current state
to still be unresolved when a new one is detected, but I think the
problem is there. Nonetheless, the problem was discovered using lockdep.

Proposed solution
=================

Practically speaking, the phy_config_inband() requirement of having
phydev-&gt;lock acquired must transfer to the caller (phylink is the only
caller). There, it must bubble up until immediately before
&amp;amp;pl-&gt;state_mutex is acquired, for the cases where that takes place.

Solution details, considerations, notes
=======================================

This is the phy_config_inband() call graph:

bpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt

Stanislav reported that in bpf_crypto_crypt() the destination dynptr's
size is not validated to be at least as large as the source dynptr's
size before calling into the crypto backend with 'len = src_len'. This
can result in an OOB write when the destination is smaller than the
source.

Concretely, in mentioned function, psrc and pdst are both linear
buffers fetched from each dynptr:

  psrc = __bpf_dynptr_data(src, src_len);
  [...]
  pdst = __bpf_dynptr_data_rw(dst, dst_len);

        ctx-&gt;type-&gt;encrypt(ctx-&gt;tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv);

The crypto backend expects pdst to be large enough with a src_len length
that can be written. Add an additional src_len &gt; dst_len check and bail
out if it's the case. Note that these kfuncs are accessible under root
privileges only.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:53:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39891 | wifi: mwifiex: Initialize the chan_stats array to zero</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39891</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mwifiex: Initialize the chan_stats array to zero

There are two potential issues here.  What if the user calls
mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey() before the data has been filled in.
Also the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn't necessarily
initialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized at
the start that could result in an information leak.

Also this array is pretty small.  It's a maximum of 900 bytes so it's

netfilter: br_netfilter: do not check confirmed bit in br_nf_local_in() after confirm

When send a broadcast packet to a tap device, which was added to a bridge,
br_nf_local_in() is called to confirm the conntrack. If another conntrack
with the same hash value is added to the hash table, which can be
triggered by a normal packet to a non-bridge device, the below warning

To solve the hash conflict, nf_ct_resolve_clash() try to merge the
conntracks, and update skb-&gt;_nfct. However, br_nf_local_in() still use the
old ct from local variable 'nfct' after confirm(), which leads to this
warning.

If confirm() does not insert the conntrack entry and return NF_DROP, the
warning may also occur. There is no need to reserve the WARN_ON_ONCE, just
remove it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:43:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39895 | sched: Fix sched_numa_find_nth_cpu() if mask offline</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39895</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: Fix sched_numa_find_nth_cpu() if mask offline

sched_numa_find_nth_cpu() uses a bsearch to look for the 'closest'
CPU in sched_domains_numa_masks and given cpus mask. However they
might not intersect if all CPUs in the cpus mask are offline. bsearch
will return NULL in that case, bail out instead of dereferencing a
bogus pointer.

The previous behaviour lead to this bug when using maxcpus=4 on an

mm/userfaultfd: fix kmap_local LIFO ordering for CONFIG_HIGHPTE

With CONFIG_HIGHPTE on 32-bit ARM, move_pages_pte() maps PTE pages using
kmap_local_page(), which requires unmapping in Last-In-First-Out order.

The current code maps dst_pte first, then src_pte, but unmaps them in the
same order (dst_pte, src_pte), violating the LIFO requirement.  This
causes the warning in kunmap_local_indexed():

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 604 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x178/0x17c
  addr \!= __fix_to_virt(FIX_KMAP_BEGIN + idx)

Fix this by reversing the unmap order to respect LIFO ordering.

This issue follows the same pattern as similar fixes:
- commit eca6828403b8 ("crypto: skcipher - fix mismatch between mapping and unmapping order")
- commit 8cf57c6df818 ("nilfs2: eliminate staggered calls to kunmap in nilfs_rename")

Both of which addressed the same fundamental requirement that kmap_local

i40e: remove read access to debugfs files

The 'command' and 'netdev_ops' debugfs files are a legacy debugging
interface supported by the i40e driver since its early days by commit
02e9c290814c ("i40e: debugfs interface").

Both of these debugfs files provide a read handler which is mostly useless,
and which is implemented with questionable logic. They both use a static
256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of
the 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes
space. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is
saved here.

On read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device
followed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static
buffer. For 'command' this will always be ": ". For 'netdev_ops',
this will be ": ". But note the buffer is
shared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly
meaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously
as there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.

We have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions
about their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in
reading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely
impossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.
For the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user
carefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,
which could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then
causes the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated
by kzalloc.

A minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would
cap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A
more involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,
saving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as
input.

Instead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These
are debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that
dropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is
pretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard
interfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if
you issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.

In order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to
refactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use
the same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.
Update the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we
free the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on
multiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer
along with removing the read access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:44:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39902 | mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39902</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()

object_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such as
the freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid,
attempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it does
not point to a valid object.

One known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks()
determines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of a
freelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it. The debug code
should report and handle the corruption gracefully and not crash in the
process.

In case the pointer is NULL or check_valid_pointer() returns false for
the pointer, only print the pointer value and skip accessing metadata.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:44:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39903 | of_numa: fix uninitialized memory nodes causing kernel panic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39903</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of_numa: fix uninitialized memory nodes causing kernel panic

When there are memory-only nodes (nodes without CPUs), these nodes are not
properly initialized, causing kernel panic during boot.

of_numa_init
	of_numa_parse_cpu_nodes
		node_set(nid, numa_nodes_parsed);
	of_numa_parse_memory_nodes

In of_numa_parse_cpu_nodes, numa_nodes_parsed gets updated only for nodes
containing CPUs.  Memory-only nodes should have been updated in
of_numa_parse_memory_nodes, but they weren't.

Subsequently, when free_area_init() attempts to access NODE_DATA() for
these uninitialized memory nodes, the kernel panics due to NULL pointer
dereference.

This can be reproduced on ARM64 QEMU with 1 CPU and 2 memory nodes:

A successful attack requires the presence of Janino library and Spring Framework to be present on the user's class path. In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a 
configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious 
environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both 
cases, the attack requires existing privilege.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 07:44:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36852 | Custom Searchable Data Entry System &amp;lt;= 1.7.1 - Unauthenticated Database Wiping</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36852</link><description>The Custom Searchable Data Entry System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated database wiping in versions up to, and including 1.7.1, due to a missing capability check and lack of sufficient validation on the ghazale_sds_delete_entries_table_row() function.

Versions between 2.1.0 and 2.14.19, 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.7, and 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.0.18 contain a race condition in the repository credentials handler that can cause the Argo CD server to panic and crash when concurrent operations are performed on the same repository URL. The vulnerability is located in numerous repository related handlers in the util/db/repository_secrets.go file. A valid API token with repositories resource permissions (create, update, or delete actions) is required to trigger the race condition. This vulnerability causes the entire Argo CD server to crash and become unavailable. Attackers can repeatedly and continuously trigger the race condition to maintain a denial-of-service state, disrupting all GitOps operations. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 23:00:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61792 | Quadient DS-700 iQ devices through 2025-09-30 might have a race condition during the quick clicking of (in order) the Question Mark button, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61792</link><description>Quadient DS-700 iQ devices through 2025-09-30 might have a race condition during the quick clicking of (in order) the Question Mark button, the Help Button, the About button, and the Help Button, leading to a transition out of kiosk mode into local administrative access. NOTE: the reporter indicates that the "behavior was observed sporadically" during "limited time on the client site," making it not "possible to gain more information about the specific kiosk mode crashing issue," and the only conclusion was "there appears to be some form of race condition." Accordingly, there can be doubt that a reproducible cybersecurity vulnerability was identified; sporadic software crashes can also be caused by a hardware fault on a single device (for example, transient RAM errors). The reporter also describes a variety of other issues, including initial access via USB because of the absence of a "lock-pick resistant locking solution for the External Controller PC cabinet," which is not a cybersecurity vulnerability (section 4.1.5 of the CNA Operational Rules). Finally, it is unclear whether the device or OS configuration was inappropriate, given that the risks are typically limited to insider threats within the mail operations room of a large company.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:51:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43826 | Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Web Content translation in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.112, and older unsupporte...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43826</link><description>Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Web Content translation in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.112, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.8, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.10, 7.4 GA through update 92, and older unsupported versions allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via any rich text field in a web content article.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:42:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10659 | MegaSys Enterprises Telenium Online Web Application OS Command Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10659</link><description>The Telenium Online Web Application is vulnerable due to a PHP endpoint accessible to unauthenticated network users that improperly handles user-supplied input.

The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses, allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts. Version 4.2 introduces user-based lockout mechanisms to mitigate brute-force attacks, user enumeration remains possible by default. In versions prior to 4.2, no such user-level protection is in place, only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g., rotating IP or proxies). Effectively bypassing both login and password reset security controls. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to enumerate valid email addresses registered for the application, increasing the risk of follow-up attacks such as password spraying.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 18:59:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11195 | Rapid7 AppSpider Project Name Validation Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11195</link><description>Rapid7 AppSpider Pro versions below 7.5.021 suffer from a project name validation vulnerability, whereby an attacker can change the project name directly in the configuration file to a name that already exists.

A temporary password or reset token issued to one user can be used to log in as another user, due to improper validation of token-user linkage. This allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to any user account by exploiting the password reset mechanism. The vulnerability occurs because the reset token is not correctly bound to the requesting account and is accepted for other user emails during login, enabling privilege escalation and information disclosure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:43:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7493 | Freeipa: idm: privilege escalation from host to domain admin in freeipa</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7493</link><description>A privilege escalation flaw from host to domain administrator was found in FreeIPA.

The Control and Status Register (CSR) logic has a flawed interaction between exception handling and exception return (MRET) mechanisms which can cause faulty trap behavior. When the MRET instruction is executed in machine mode without being in an exception state, an Instruction Access Fault may be triggered. This results in both the exception handling logic and the exception return logic activating simultaneously, leading to conflicting updates to the control and status registers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 14:54:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57852 | Openshift-ai: privilege escalation via excessive /etc/passwd permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57852</link><description>A container privilege escalation flaw was found in KServe ModelMesh container images.

password based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to
Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause
a memory corruption which can have various consequences including
a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.

Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to
perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS
messages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as
Moderate severity according to our Security Policy.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9231 | Timing side-channel in SM2 algorithm on 64 bit ARM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9231</link><description>Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote
recovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit
ARM platforms.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit
ARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..

While remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,
timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.

OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so
this CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is
possible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled
with the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be
recoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate
severity issue.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9232 | Out-of-bounds read in HTTP client no_proxy handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9232</link><description>Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may
trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and
the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.

Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to
Denial of Service for an application.

The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications
but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate
Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs used
by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.

In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.
Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be
passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have
a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the
issue was assessed as Low severity.

The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:
3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this
issue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
boundary.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10859 | Cookie storage for non-HTML temporary documents was being shared incorrectly with normal browsing content, allowing information from private...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10859</link><description>Cookie storage for non-HTML temporary documents was being shared incorrectly with normal browsing content, allowing information from private tabs to escape Incognito mode even after the user closed all tabs This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS &lt; 143.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:21:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11152 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.0.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11152</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.0.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:21:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11153 | This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.0.3.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11153</link><description>This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 143.0.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:21:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10217 | A vulnerability exists in Asset Suite for an authenticated user to manipulate the content of performance related log data or to inject craft...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10217</link><description>A vulnerability exists in Asset Suite for an authenticated user to manipulate the content of performance related log data or to inject crafted data in logfile for potentially carrying out further malicious attacks.

As a result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain full administrative control of the system during the initial setup. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-022 — Insecure Installation Credentials.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 20:53:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34224 | Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Unauthenticated Device Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34224</link><description>Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA/SaaS deployments) expose a set of PHP scripts under the `console_release` directory without requiring authentication.

An admin‑level attacker can therefore point the hostname to a malicious web server that issues a 301 redirect to internal endpoints such as the AWS EC2 metadata service. The server follows the redirect, retrieves the metadata, and returns or stores the credentials, enabling the attacker to steal cloud IAM keys, enumerate internal services, and pivot further into the SaaS infrastructure.

Because the key is hardcoded, any attacker who can gain container-level access can simply read the files and obtain the private key. With the private key, the attacker can decrypt TLS traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or forge TLS certificates. This enables impersonation of the appliance’s web UI, interception of credentials, and unrestricted access to any services that trust the certificate.

If an account is locked out due to not enrolling in MFA (e.g. after the 7-day enforcement window), the REST API still allows the use of Basic Authentication to authenticate and perform administrative actions. In particular, the default admin account was found to be locked out via the web interface but still usable through the REST API. This allowed creation of a new privileged user, bypassing MFA protections. This undermines the intended security posture of MFA enforcement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:35:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57428 | Default credentials in Italy Wireless Mini Router WIRELESS-N 300M v28K.MiniRouter.20190211 allows attackers to gain access to the debug shel...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57428</link><description>Default credentials in Italy Wireless Mini Router WIRELESS-N 300M v28K.MiniRouter.20190211 allows attackers to gain access to the debug shell exposed via Telnet on Port 23 and execute hardware-level flash and register manipulation commands.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:12:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13150 | SQLi in Fayton Software&amp;#x27;s fayton.pro ERP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13150</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Fayton Software and Consulting Services fayton.Pro ERP allows SQL Injection.This issue affects fayton.Pro ERP: through 20250929.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:22:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9648 | Denial of Service in CivetWeb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9648</link><description>A vulnerability in the CivetWeb library's function mg_handle_form_request allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.
