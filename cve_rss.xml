sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
switch_drv_remove()              |
 flush_work()                    |
  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                 |   schedule_work(&amp;psw-&gt;work)
 timer_shutdown_sync()           |
 ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
 kfree(psw) // free              |
                                 |   psw-&gt;state = 0 // use

This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
stopped safely before the deallocate operations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 09:22:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2409 | The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1.

netfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write

If priv-&gt;len is a multiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past
the destination array which leads to stack corruption.

This construct is necessary to clean the remainder of the register
in case -&gt;len is NOT a multiple of the register size, so make it
conditional just like nft_payload.c does.

The bug was added in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when
tcp/sctp and ip option support was added.

Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving all of the above attacks.

&#13; This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of LISP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LISP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; Note: This vulnerability could be exploited over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:03:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20316 | A vulnerability in the data model interface (DMI) services of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to acces...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20316</link><description>A vulnerability in the data model interface (DMI) services of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access resources that should have been protected by a configured IPv4 access control list (ACL).&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper handling of error conditions when a successfully authorized device administrator updates an IPv4 ACL using the NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol, and the update would reorder access control entries (ACEs) in the updated ACL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing resources that should have been protected across an affected device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:54:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20354 | A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adj...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20354</link><description>A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete DoS condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20333 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20333</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change specific data within the interface on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change a specific field within the web-based management interface, even though they should not have access to change that field.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:47:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2985 | Tenda FH1202 QuickIndex formQuickIndex stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2985</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda FH1202 1.2.0.14(408).
