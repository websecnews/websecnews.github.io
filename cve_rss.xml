In versions 2.6.0 through 2.26.3, the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication. An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback in a cookie, which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL, appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim's tokens and perform full account takeover, including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens are further leaked via browser history, Referer headers, and server logs. This vulnerability impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required. The issue is fixed in version 2.28.0. No known workarounds exist.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:13:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55619 | Reolink v4.54.0.4.20250526 was discovered to contain a hardcoded encryption key and initialization vector.

Versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.2, 3.0.0 to 3.3.6, and all versions prior to 2.71.15 are vulnerable to a username enumeration issue in the login interface. The login UI includes a security feature, Ignoring unknown usernames, that is intended to prevent username enumeration by returning a generic response for both valid and invalid usernames. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass this protection by submitting arbitrary userIDs to the select account page and distinguishing between valid and invalid accounts based on the system's response. For effective exploitation, an attacker needs to iterate through possible userIDs, but the impact can be limited by implementing rate limiting or similar measures. The issue has been patched in versions 4.0.3, 3.4.0, and 2.71.15.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:55:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53494 | Incorrect access control in the preHandle function of SpringBootBlog v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive components without authenti...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53494</link><description>Incorrect access control in the preHandle function of SpringBootBlog v1.0.0 allows attackers to access sensitive components without authentication.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:55:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50644 | zhisheng17 blog 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT has an authentication bypass vulnerability.

In versions prior to 3.25.5, Roo-Code fails to properly handle process substitution and single ampersand characters in the command parsing logic for auto-execute commands. If a user has enabled auto-approved execution for a command such as ls, an attacker who can submit crafted prompts to the agent may inject arbitrary commands to be executed alongside the intended command. Exploitation requires attacker access to submit prompts and for the user to have enabled auto-approved command execution, which is disabled by default. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The issue is fixed in version 3.25.5.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:43:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55745 | UnoPim Quick Export feature is vulnerable to CSV injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55745</link><description>UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel framework. Versions 0.3.0 and prior are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection, in the Quick Export feature. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious content into exported CSV files. When the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel, the malicious input may be interpreted as a formula or command, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's device. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, including the establishment of a reverse shell. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.1 or later.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:43:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57105 | The DI-7400G+ router has a command injection vulnerability, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device.

xfrm: state: initialize state_ptrs earlier in xfrm_state_find

In case of preemption, xfrm_state_look_at will find a different
pcpu_id and look up states for that other CPU. If we matched a state
for CPU2 in the state_cache while the lookup started on CPU1, we will
jump to "found", but the "best" state that we got will be ignored and
we will enter the "acquire" block. This block uses state_ptrs, which
isn't initialized at this point.

Let's initialize state_ptrs just after taking rcu_read_lock. This will
also prevent a possible misuse in the future, if someone adjusts this
function.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55603 | Tenda AX3 V16.03.12.10_CN is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the fromSetSysTime function via the ntpServer parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55603</link><description>Tenda AX3 V16.03.12.10_CN is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the fromSetSysTime function via the ntpServer parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55606 | Tenda AX3 V16.03.12.10_CN is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the fromAdvSetMacMtuWan function via the serverName parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55606</link><description>Tenda AX3 V16.03.12.10_CN is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the fromAdvSetMacMtuWan function via the serverName parameter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55741 | unopim/unopim allows unauthorized product deletion via mass-delete endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55741</link><description>UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel framework. In versions 0.3.0 and earlier, users without the Delete privilege for products are unable to delete individual products via the standard endpoint, as expected. However, these users can bypass intended access controls by issuing requests to the mass-delete endpoint, allowing them to delete products without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized product deletion, leading to potential data loss and business disruption. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.1.

media: ti: j721e-csi2rx: fix list_del corruption

If ti_csi2rx_start_dma() fails in ti_csi2rx_dma_callback(), the buffer is
marked done with VB2_BUF_STATE_ERROR but is not removed from the DMA queue.
This causes the same buffer to be retried in the next iteration, resulting
in a double list_del() and eventual list corruption.

Fix this by removing the buffer from the queue before calling
vb2_buffer_done() on error.

This resolves a crash due to list_del corruption:

zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set

When a zoned loop device, or zloop device, is removed, KASAN enabled
kernel reports "BUG KASAN use-after-free" in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The
BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk(), which invokes
zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for
the zlo pointer. However, after the memory is freed, zloop_ctl_remove()
calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&amp;amp;zlo-&gt;tag_set), which accesses the freed zlo.
Hence the KASAN use-after-free.

 zloop_ctl_remove()
  put_disk(zlo-&gt;disk)
   put_device()
    kobject_put()
     ...
      zloop_free_disk()
        kvfree(zlo)
  blk_mq_free_tag_set(&amp;amp;zlo-&gt;tag_set)

To avoid the BUG, move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&amp;amp;zlo-&gt;tag_set)
from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that
the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo).</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38621 | md: make rdev_addable usable for rcu mode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38621</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

To trigger gso segment in udp_queue_rcv_skb(), we should also set option
UDP_ENCAP_ESPINUDP to enable udp_sk(sk)-&gt;encap_rcv. When the encap_rcv
hook return 1 in udp_queue_rcv_one_skb(), udp_csum_pull_header() will try
to pull udphdr, but the skb size has been segmented to gso size, which
leads to this crash.

Previous commit cf329aa42b66 ("udp: cope with UDP GRO packet misdirection")
introduces segmentation in UDP receive path only for GRO, which was never
intended to be used for UFO, so drop UFO packets in udp_rcv_segment().</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38623 | PCI: pnv_php: Fix surprise plug detection and recovery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38623</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pnv_php: Fix surprise plug detection and recovery

The existing PowerNV hotplug code did not handle surprise plug events
correctly, leading to a complete failure of the hotplug system after device
removal and a required reboot to detect new devices.

This comes down to two issues:

 1) When a device is surprise removed, often the bridge upstream
    port will cause a PE freeze on the PHB.  If this freeze is not
    cleared, the MSI interrupts from the bridge hotplug notification
    logic will not be received by the kernel, stalling all plug events
    on all slots associated with the PE.

 2) When a device is removed from a slot, regardless of surprise or
    programmatic removal, the associated PHB/PE ls left frozen.
    If this freeze is not cleared via a fundamental reset, skiboot
    is unable to clear the freeze and cannot retrain / rescan the
    slot.  This also requires a reboot to clear the freeze and redetect
    the device in the slot.

Issue the appropriate unfreeze and rescan commands on hotplug events,
and don't oops on hotplug if pci_bus_to_OF_node() returns NULL.

PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug

When the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the
pnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges'
hotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.

Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources
before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().

Also modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so
that it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of
pnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will
now be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the
workqueue needs to stay allocated.

a little bit later when there is multiple threads writing data w/

vdpa/mlx5: Fix release of uninitialized resources on error path

The commit in the fixes tag made sure that mlx5_vdpa_free()
is the single entrypoint for removing the vdpa device resources
added in mlx5_vdpa_dev_add(), even in the cleanup path of
mlx5_vdpa_dev_add().

This means that all functions from mlx5_vdpa_free() should be able to
handle uninitialized resources. This was not the case though:
mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() and mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
were not able to do so. This caused the splat below when adding
a vdpa device without a MAC address.

This patch fixes these remaining issues:

- Makes mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() return early if called on
  uninitialized resources.

- Moves mlx5_cmd_init_async_ctx() early on during device addition
  because it can't fail. This means that mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
  also can't fail. To mirror this, move the call site of
  mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx() in mlx5_vdpa_free().

An additional comment was added in mlx5_vdpa_free() to document
the expectations of functions called from this context.

Splat:

and getting rid of the pm_runtime_disable() in the cleanup path.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38632 | pinmux: fix race causing mux_owner NULL with active mux_usecount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38632</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinmux: fix race causing mux_owner NULL with active mux_usecount

commit 5a3e85c3c397 ("pinmux: Use sequential access to access
desc-&gt;pinmux data") tried to address the issue when two client of the
same gpio calls pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, was
resulting in NULL pointer issue while accessing desc-&gt;mux_owner.
However, issue was not completely fixed due to the way it was handled
and it can still result in the same NULL pointer.

The issue occurs due to the following interleaving:

     cpu0 (process A)                   cpu1 (process B)

      pin_request() {                   pin_free() {

                                         mutex_lock()
                                         desc-&gt;mux_usecount--; //becomes 0
                                         ..
                                         mutex_unlock()

  mutex_lock(desc-&gt;mux)
  desc-&gt;mux_usecount++; // becomes 1
  desc-&gt;mux_owner = owner;
  mutex_unlock(desc-&gt;mux)

                                         mutex_lock(desc-&gt;mux)
                                         desc-&gt;mux_owner = NULL;
                                         mutex_unlock(desc-&gt;mux)

This sequence leads to a state where the pin appears to be in use
(`mux_usecount == 1`) but has no owner (`mux_owner == NULL`), which can
cause NULL pointer on next pin_request on the same pin.

Ensure that updates to mux_usecount and mux_owner are performed
atomically under the same lock. Only clear mux_owner when mux_usecount
reaches zero and no new owner has been assigned.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38633 | clk: spacemit: mark K1 pll1_d8 as critical</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38633</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: spacemit: mark K1 pll1_d8 as critical

The pll1_d8 clock is enabled by the boot loader, and is ultimately a
parent for numerous clocks, including those used by APB and AXI buses.
Guodong Xu discovered that this clock got disabled while responding to
getting -EPROBE_DEFER when requesting a reset controller.

The needed clock (CLK_DMA, along with its parents) had already been
enabled.  To respond to the probe deferral return, the CLK_DMA clock
was disabled, and this led to parent clocks also reducing their enable
count.  When the enable count for pll1_d8 was decremented it became 0,
which caused it to be disabled.  This led to a system hang.

Marking that clock critical resolves this by preventing it from being
disabled.

Define a new macro CCU_FACTOR_GATE_DEFINE() to allow clock flags to
be supplied for a CCU_FACTOR_GATE clock.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38634 | power: supply: cpcap-charger: Fix null check for power_supply_get_by_name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38634</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rv: Use strings in da monitors tracepoints

Using DA monitors tracepoints with KASAN enabled triggers the following
warning:

 BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0xd6/0x1a0

  trace_event_sncid+0x163/0x200
 [...]
 The buggy address belongs to the variable:
  automaton_snep+0x4e0/0x5e0

This is caused by the tracepoints reading 32 bytes __array instead of
__string from the automata definition. Such strings are literals and
reading 32 bytes ends up in out of bound memory accesses (e.g. the next
automaton's data in this case).
The error is harmless as, while printing the string, we stop at the null
terminator, but it should still be fixed.

Use the __string facilities while defining the tracepoints to avoid
reading out of bound memory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38638 | ipv6: add a retry logic in net6_rt_notify()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38638</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: reject TDLS operations when station is not associated

syzbot triggered a WARN in ieee80211_tdls_oper() by sending
NL80211_TDLS_ENABLE_LINK immediately after NL80211_CMD_CONNECT,
before association completed and without prior TDLS setup.

This left internal state like sdata-&gt;u.mgd.tdls_peer uninitialized,
leading to a WARN_ON() in code paths that assumed it was valid.

Reject the operation early if not in station mode or not associated.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38645 | net/mlx5: Check device memory pointer before usage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38645</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: avoid NULL dereference when RX problematic packet on unsupported 6 GHz band

With a quite rare chance, RX report might be problematic to make SW think
a packet is received on 6 GHz band even if the chip does not support 6 GHz
band actually. Since SW won't initialize stuffs for unsupported bands, NULL
dereference will happen then in the sequence, rtw89_vif_rx_stats_iter() -&gt;
rtw89_core_cancel_6ghz_probe_tx(). So, add a check to avoid it.

The following is a crash log for this case.

spi: stm32: Check for cfg availability in stm32_spi_probe

The stm32_spi_probe function now includes a check to ensure that the
pointer returned by of_device_get_match_data is not NULL before
accessing its members. This resolves a warning where a potential NULL
pointer dereference could occur when accessing cfg-&gt;has_device_mode.

Before accessing the 'has_device_mode' member, we verify that 'cfg' is
not NULL. If 'cfg' is NULL, an error message is logged.

This change ensures that the driver does not attempt to access
configuration data if it is not available, thus preventing a potential
system crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38649 | arm64: dts: qcom: qcs615: fix a crash issue caused by infinite loop for Coresight</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38649</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

An infinite loop has been created by the Coresight devices. When only a

ultimately leading to a stack overflow and system crash. Therefore, disable

To avoid deadlock, Commit 31651c607151 ("hfsplus: avoid deadlock
on file truncation") unlock extree before hfsplus_free_extents(),
and add check wheather extree is locked in hfsplus_free_extents().

However, when operations such as hfsplus_file_release,
hfsplus_setattr, hfsplus_unlink, and hfsplus_get_block are executed
concurrently in different files, it is very likely to trigger the
WARN_ON, which will lead syzbot and xfstest to consider it as an
abnormality.

The comment above this warning also describes one of the easy
triggering situations, which can easily trigger and cause
xfstest&amp;amp;syzbot to report errors.

Several threads could try to lock the shared extents tree.
And warning can be triggered in one thread when another thread
has locked the tree. This is the wrong behavior of the code and
we need to remove the warning.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38651 | landlock: Fix warning from KUnit tests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38651</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If device path length equals to MAX_PATH_LEN, sbi-&gt;devs.path[] may
not end up w/ null character due to path array is fully filled, So
accidently, fields locate after path[] may be treated as part of
device path, result in parsing wrong device path.

Let's add one byte space for sbi-&gt;devs.path[] to store null

nvmet: pci-epf: Do not complete commands twice if nvmet_req_init() fails

Have nvmet_req_init() and req-&gt;execute() complete failed commands.

Description of the problem:
nvmet_req_init() calls __nvmet_req_complete() internally upon failure,
e.g., unsupported opcode, which calls the "queue_response" callback,
this results in nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() being called, which will
call nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() if data_len is 0 or if dma_dir is
different from DMA_TO_DEVICE. This results in a double completion as
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() also calls nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod()
when nvmet_req_init() fails.

Steps to reproduce:
On the host send a command with an unsupported opcode with nvme-cli,
For example the admin command "security receive"
$ sudo nvme security-recv /dev/nvme0n1 -n1 -x4096

This triggers a double completion as nvmet_req_init() fails and
nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() is called, here iod-&gt;dma_dir is still
in the default state of "DMA_NONE" as set by default in
nvmet_pci_epf_alloc_iod(), so nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is called.
Because nvmet_req_init() failed nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is also
called in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() leading to a double completion.
This not only sends two completions to the host but also corrupts the
state of the PCI NVMe target leading to kernel oops.

This patch lets nvmet_req_init() and req-&gt;execute() complete all failed
commands, and removes the double completion case in
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() therefore fixing the edge cases where
double completions occurred.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38659 | gfs2: No more self recovery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38659</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: No more self recovery

When a node withdraws and it turns out that it is the only node that has
the filesystem mounted, gfs2 currently tries to replay the local journal
to bring the filesystem back into a consistent state.  Not only is that
a very bad idea, it has also never worked because gfs2_recover_func()
will refuse to do anything during a withdraw.

However, before even getting to this point, gfs2_recover_func()
dereferences sdp-&gt;sd_jdesc-&gt;jd_inode.  This was a use-after-free before
commit 04133b607a78 ("gfs2: Prevent double iput for journal on error")

The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the
object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space
releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted
in a NULL-pointer deref.

Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 ("drm/gem: Acquire references on
GEM handles for framebuffers") and commit f6bfc9afc751 ("drm/framebuffer:
Acquire internal references on GEM handles") only solved the problem
partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM
framebuffer associated.

Hence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach-&gt;dmabuf.

arm64/entry: Mask DAIF in cpu_switch_to(), call_on_irq_stack()

`cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()` manipulate SP to change
to different stacks along with the Shadow Call Stack if it is enabled.
Those two stack changes cannot be done atomically and both functions
can be interrupted by SErrors or Debug Exceptions which, though unlikely,
is very much broken : if interrupted, we can end up with mismatched stacks
and Shadow Call Stack leading to clobbered stacks.

In `cpu_switch_to()`, it can happen when SP_EL0 points to the new task,
but x18 stills points to the old task's SCS. When the interrupt handler
tries to save the task's SCS pointer, it will save the old task
SCS pointer (x18) into the new task struct (pointed to by SP_EL0),
clobbering it.

In `call_on_irq_stack()`, it can happen when switching from the task stack
to the IRQ stack and when switching back. In both cases, we can be
interrupted when the SCS pointer points to the IRQ SCS, but SP points to
the task stack. The nested interrupt handler pushes its return addresses
on the IRQ SCS. It then detects that SP points to the task stack,
calls `call_on_irq_stack()` and clobbers the task SCS pointer with
the IRQ SCS pointer, which it will also use !

This leads to tasks returning to addresses on the wrong SCS,
or even on the IRQ SCS, triggering kernel panics via CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
or FPAC if enabled.

This is possible on a default config, but unlikely.
However, when enabling CONFIG_ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI, DAIF is unmasked and
instead the GIC is responsible for filtering what interrupts the CPU
should receive based on priority.
Given the goal of emulating NMIs, pseudo-NMIs can be received by the CPU
even in `cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()`, possibly *very*
frequently depending on the system configuration and workload, leading
to unpredictable kernel panics.

Completely mask DAIF in `cpu_switch_to()` and restore it when returning.
Do the same in `call_on_irq_stack()`, but restore and mask around
the branch.

i2c: qup: jump out of the loop in case of timeout

Original logic only sets the return value but doesn't jump out of the
loop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. A
malicious or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case and
should be avoided. This is observed during a long time test with a
PCA953x GPIO extender.

Fix it by changing the logic to not only sets the return value, but also
jumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:20:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38672 | Revert &amp;quot;drm/gem-dma: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38672</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "drm/gem-dma: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance"

This reverts commit e8afa1557f4f963c9a511bd2c6074a941c308685.

The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the
object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space
releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted
in a NULL-pointer deref.

Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 ("drm/gem: Acquire references on
GEM handles for framebuffers") and commit f6bfc9afc751 ("drm/framebuffer:
Acquire internal references on GEM handles") only solved the problem
partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM
framebuffer associated.

Hence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach-&gt;dmabuf.

If we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of the

 - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's
   of the same type
 - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA

Just check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list

tls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULP

TLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP socket.
This cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socket
entered before the TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standard
read API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the WARN_ON() and a buggy
early exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with real
error handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.

We already reload the anchor every time we (re)acquire the socket lock,
so the only condition we need to avoid is an out of bounds read
(not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).

If some data was read from under TLS but there's enough in the queue
we'll reload and decrypt what is most likely not a valid TLS record.
Leading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective (corrupting
a stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crash
should take place.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38617 | net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()

When packet_set_ring() releases po-&gt;bind_lock, another thread can
run packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.

This race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7
("net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()").

There too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a
po-&gt;bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released. And
the fix was similarly to temporarily set po-&gt;num to zero to keep
the socket unhooked until the lock is retaken.

The po-&gt;bind_lock in packet_set_ring and packet_notifier precede the
introduction of git history.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-38618 | vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-38618</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY

It is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY. This can
cause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket.
The socket returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is not
on the list of unbound sockets. Binding it will result in an extra
refcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023 (vsock: Keep
the binding until socket destruction).

Modify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible() to also prevent binding
to VMADDR_PORT_ANY.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:18:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57884 | WordPress Greenshift Plugin &amp;lt;= 12.1.1 - Broken Access Control Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57884</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in wpsoul Greenshift allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.

For example, a client can open a stream and then send WINDOW_UPDATE frames with window size increment of 0, which is illegal.
Per specification  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-window_update , the server should send a RST_STREAM frame.
The client can now open another stream and send another bad WINDOW_UPDATE, therefore causing the server to consume more resources than necessary, as this case does not exceed the max number of concurrent streams, yet the client is able to create an enormous amount of streams in a short period of time.


The attack can be performed with other conditions (for example, a DATA frame for a closed stream) that cause the server to send a RST_STREAM frame.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with a file upload action, and doesn't affect sites with PHP version &gt; 8. This vulnerability also requires the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. We confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary file deletion possible when installed with this plugin. Given Contact Form 7 is a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this plugin and the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension enabled is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 03:14:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12223 | Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Nutanix Prism Central</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12223</link><description>Prism Central versions prior to 2024.3.1 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting attack via the Events component, allowing an attacker to hijack a victim user’s session and perform actions in their security context.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9132 | Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a cr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9132</link><description>Out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 139.0.7258.138 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

Impacted is an unknown function of the component Password Reset Handler. Executing manipulation of the argument redirectUrl can lead to open redirect. The attack may be performed from a remote location. The exploit has been published and may be used. Upgrading to version 12.1.2410.274, 12.1.2502.178 and 12.1.2506.121 is recommended to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor explains, that "[o]ur internal validation (...) confirms that the reported behavior does not exist in currently supported releases. In these tests, the redirectUrl parameter is ignored, and no malicious redirection occurs." This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:02:34 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
