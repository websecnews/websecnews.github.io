Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account. The Pocketbase admin API does not check for authentication/authorization when creating an admin account when no admin accounts have been added. In its default deployment, Webhood does not create a database admin account. Therefore, unless users have manually created an admin account in the database, an admin account will not exist in the deployment and the deployment is vulnerable. Versions starting from 0.9.1 are patched. The patch creates a randomly generated admin account if admin accounts have not already been created i.e. the vulnerability is exploitable in the deployment. As a workaround, users can disable access to URL path starting with `/api/admins` entirely. With this workaround, the vulnerability is not exploitable via network.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 14:49:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31852 | LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can be overwritten without data being saved to the stack, and thus there can some...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31852</link><description>LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can be overwritten without data being saved to the stack, and thus there can sometimes be an exploitable error in the flow of control.

vfio/pci: Lock external INTx masking ops

Mask operations through config space changes to DisINTx may race INTx
configuration changes via ioctl.  Create wrappers that add locking for
paths outside of the core interrupt code.

In particular, irq_type is updated holding igate, therefore testing
is_intx() requires holding igate.  For example clearing DisINTx from
config space can otherwise race changes of the interrupt configuration.

This aligns interfaces which may trigger the INTx eventfd into two
camps, one side serialized by igate and the other only enabled while
INTx is configured.  A subsequent patch introduces synchronization for
the latter flows.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26812 | vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26812</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler

A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be
deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows
eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl
or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.

Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate
mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupt
handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd path
runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the
atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd
relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with
existing userspace.

As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the
INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object
and irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular
trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and
eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be
dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26813 | vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26813</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlers

The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering of
an interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user,
which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.

Rather than register the IRQ relative to a valid trigger, register all
IRQs in a disabled state in the device open path.  This allows mask
operations on the IRQ to nest within the overall enable state governed
by a valid eventfd signal.  This decouples @masked, protected by the
@locked spinlock from @trigger, protected via the @igate mutex.

In doing so, it's guaranteed that changes to @trigger cannot race the
IRQ handlers because the IRQ handler is synchronously disabled before
modifying the trigger, and loopback triggering of the IRQ via ioctl is
safe due to serialization with trigger changes via igate.

For compatibility, request_irq() failures are maintained to be local to
the SET_IRQS ioctl rather than a fatal error in the open device path.
This allows, for example, a userspace driver with polling mode support
to continue to work regardless of moving the request_irq() call site.
This necessarily blocks all SET_IRQS access to the failed index.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26814 | vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26814</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger

The eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is
initially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the trigger
eventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that
trigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), but
the loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function
need to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths
both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.

The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does it
support any sort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pci
and vfio-platform, the flow can remain essentially unchanged.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27437 | vfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27437</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ

Currently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie.
devices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq()
and subsequently disabled as necessary to align with the masked status
flag.  This presents a window where the interrupt could fire between
these events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice.
This would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents
nested enables through vfio.

Instead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx
is never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21848 | Users maintain access to active call after being removed from a channel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21848</link><description>Improper Access Control in Mattermost Server versions 8.1.x before 8.1.11 allows an attacker that is in a channel with an active call to keep participating in the call even if they are removed from the channel</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28949 | DoS via a large number of User Preferences</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28949</link><description>Mattermost Server versions 9.5.x before 9.5.2, 9.4.x before 9.4.4, 9.3.x before 9.3.3, 8.1.x before 8.1.11 don't limit the number of user preferences which allows an attacker to send a large number of user preferences potentially causing denial of service.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29221 | Invite ID available to team admins even without the &amp;quot;Add Members&amp;quot; permission</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29221</link><description>Improper Access Control in Mattermost Server versions 9.5.x before 9.5.2, 9.4.x before 9.4.4, 9.3.x before 9.3.3, 8.1.x before 8.1.11 lacked proper access control in the `/api/v4/users/me/teams` endpointÂ allowingÂ a team admin to get the invite ID of their team, thus allowing them to invite users, even if the "Add Members" permission was explicitly removed from team admins.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 08:32:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30849 | Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Sourcecodester Complete E-Commerce Site v1.0, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via f...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30849</link><description>Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Sourcecodester Complete E-Commerce Site v1.0, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via filename parameter in admin/products_photo.php.</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:49:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2115 | The LearnPress â WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2115</link><description>The LearnPress â WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.0.

It's possible for a file of a type other than a zip file to be submitted as a new plugin by an administrative user on the Plugins -&gt; Add New -&gt; Upload Plugin screen in WordPress. If FTP credentials are requested for installation (in order to move the file into place outside of the `uploads` directory) then the uploaded file remains temporary available in the Media Library despite it not being allowed. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant is set to `true` on the site _and_ FTP credentials are required when uploading a new theme or plugin, then this technically allows an RCE when the user would otherwise have no means of executing arbitrary PHP code. This issue _only_ affects Administrator level users on single site installations, and Super Admin level users on Multisite installations where it's otherwise expected that the user does not have permission to upload or execute arbitrary PHP code. Lower level users are not affected. Sites where the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is set to `true` are not affected. Sites where an administrative user either does not need to enter FTP credentials or they have access to the valid FTP credentials, are not affected. The issue was fixed in WordPress 6.4.3 on January 30, 2024 and backported to versions 6.3.3, 6.2.4, 6.1.5, 6.0.7, 5.9.9, 5.8.9, 5.7.11, 5.6.13, 5.5.14, 5.4.15, 5.3.17, 5.2.20, 5.1.18, 5.0.21, 4.9.25, 2.8.24, 4.7.28, 4.6.28, 4.5.31, 4.4.32, 4.3.33, 4.2.37, and 4.1.40. A workaround is available. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is defined as `true` then it will not be possible for any user to upload a plugin and therefore this issue will not be exploitable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 23:17:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31211 | Remote Code Execution in `WP_HTML_Token`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31211</link><description>WordPress is an open publishing platform for the Web.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 20:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31204 | mailcow Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability via Exception Handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31204</link><description>mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk. Version 2024-04 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 20:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3311 | Dreamer CMS ThemesController.java ZipUtils.unZipFiles path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3311</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Dreamer CMS up to 4.1.3.0.

The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood.

Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 19:12:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30249 | Cloudburst Network DoS in RakNet connection handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30249</link><description>Cloudburst Network provides network components used within Cloudburst projects. A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix.

Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`) shows the available streams by fetching the API (`[0]`) in the client side. Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the result (`[1]`) whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML` (`[2]`). In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in the context of go2rtcâs origin.

Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication, an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application, and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF, it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a "drive-by" attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config`, which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance.

In versions 1.29.0 and 1.29.1, theEnvoy HTTP/2 protocol stack is vulnerable to the flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec does not reset a request when header map limits have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited memory consumption. This can lead to denial of service through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to versions 1.29.2 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. Note that this vulnerability is a regression in Envoy version 1.29.0 and 1.29.1 only. As a workaround, downgrade to version 1.28.1 or earlier or disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 14:40:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3250 | It was discovered that Canonical's Pebble service manager read-file API and the associated pebble pull command, before v1.10.2, allowed unpr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3250</link><description>It was discovered that Canonical's Pebble service manager read-file API and the associated pebble pull command, before v1.10.2, allowed unprivileged local users to read files with root-equivalent permissions when Pebble was running as root.

Prior to version 0.42.0, an attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of `NEW_CONNECTION_ID` frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate.

Quarkus captures the local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build. Thus, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. &#13;
&#13;
However, some local environment variables may have been set by the developer / CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during the application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application. It leads to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values.&#13;
&#13;
This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. So, application-specific properties are not captured.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:53:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2759 | Improper access control in Apaczka plugin for PrestaShop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2759</link><description>Improper access control vulnerability in Apaczka plugin for PrestaShop allows information gathering from saved templates without authentication.This issue affects Apaczka plugin for PrestaShop from v1 through v4.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:29:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27575 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH WebServer CPS220/64 V.3.3.19 allows a rem...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27575</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH INOTEC Sicherheitstechnik GmbH WebServer CPS220/64 V.3.3.19 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the /etc/passwd file.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:10:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26808 | netfilter: nft_chain_filter: handle NETDEV_UNREGISTER for inet/ingress basechain</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26808</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

At the time of LPAR dump, before kexec hands over control to kdump
kernel, DDWs (Dynamic DMA Windows) are scanned and added to the FDT.
For the SR-IOV case, default DMA window "ibm,dma-window" is removed from
the FDT and DDW added, for the device.

Now, kexec hands over control to the kdump kernel.

When the kdump kernel initializes, PCI busses are scanned and IOMMU
group/tables created, in pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP(). For the SR-IOV
case, there is no "ibm,dma-window". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,
fixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.
When TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU
tables.

iommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers "ibm,dma-window" property
when initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are
dynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not
initialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the
SR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().

The fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the
FDT. There are 2 points to remember:

	1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both
	   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to
	   initialize the IOMMU table.

	2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would
	   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as
	   "dynamic". This works fine since, at the time of table
	   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the
	   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for
	   kdump to succeed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 08:27:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26746 | dmaengine: idxd: Ensure safe user copy of completion record</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26746</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.

syzbot reported another task hung in __unix_gc().  [0]

The current while loop assumes that all of the left candidates
have oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb) releases the remaining
candidates.

However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd and
another fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in the
candidate list.  Then, the while loop never proceeds, resulting
the task hung.

__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,
so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let __skb_queue_purge()
release all inflight sockets.

af_unix: Fix task hung while purging oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a task hung; at the same time, GC was looping infinitely
in list_for_each_entry_safe() for OOB skb.  [0]

syzbot demonstrated that the list_for_each_entry_safe() was not actually
safe in this case.

A single skb could have references for multiple sockets.  If we free such
a skb in the list_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets could
be unlinked in a single iteration.

unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlink the socket, so the
prefetched next socket forms a loop itself and list_for_each_entry_safe()
never stops.

Here, we must use while() and make sure we always fetch the first socket.

mptcp: fix double-free on socket dismantle

when MPTCP server accepts an incoming connection, it clones its listener
socket. However, the pointer to 'inet_opt' for the new socket has the same
value as the original one: as a consequence, on program exit it's possible
to observe the following splat:

mm/vmscan: fix a bug calling wakeup_kswapd() with a wrong zone index

With numa balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node
doesn't have its local memory so it has no managed zones, the following
oops has been observed.  It's because wakeup_kswapd() is called with a
wrong zone index, -1.  Fixed it by checking the index before calling
wakeup_kswapd().

On unloading of the scmi_perf_domain module got the below splat, when in
the DT provided to the system under test the '#power-domain-cells' property
was missing. Indeed, this particular setup causes the probe to bail out
early without giving any error, which leads to the -&gt;remove() callback gets
to run too, but without all the expected initialized structures in place.

Add a check and bail out early on remove too.

crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input

The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128
bytes, and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or
inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.

It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper, which performs all
memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register).
For this reason, the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs
shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer, given that this is a rare
occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm
code.

The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into
account, potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the
same workaround, and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 08:27:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26790 | dmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26790</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot creation failure

When creating a snapshot we may do a double free of an anonymous device
in case there's an error committing the transaction. The second free may
result in freeing an anonymous device number that was allocated by some
other subsystem in the kernel or another btrfs filesystem.

The steps that lead to this:

1) At ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we allocate an anonymous device number
   and assign it to pending_snapshot-&gt;anon_dev;

2) Then we call btrfs_commit_transaction() and end up at
   transaction.c:create_pending_snapshot();

3) There we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root() and pass it the anonymous device
   number stored in pending_snapshot-&gt;anon_dev;

4) btrfs_get_new_fs_root() frees that anonymous device number because
   btrfs_lookup_fs_root() returned a root - someone else did a lookup
   of the new root already, which could some task doing backref walking;

5) After that some error happens in the transaction commit path, and at
   ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we jump to the 'fail' label, and after
   that we free again the same anonymous device number, which in the
   meanwhile may have been reallocated somewhere else, because
   pending_snapshot-&gt;anon_dev still has the same value as in step 1.

Recently syzbot ran into this and reported the following trace:

btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration of
the fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens like
this:

1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers
   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item
   in the leaf currently being processed;

2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,
   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item
   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range
   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[
   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;

3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls
   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the
   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is
   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding
   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has
   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;

4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers
   the warning:

      if (cache-&gt;offset + cache-&gt;len &gt; offset) {
               WARN_ON(1);
               return -EINVAL;
      }

   Since we get 1M &gt; 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the
   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that
   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap
   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack
   trace like the following:

This happens because in the legacy case the ctr_get_width function was not
defined, but it is used in arch_perf_update_userpage.

drm/amd/display: Prevent potential buffer overflow in map_hw_resources

Adds a check in the map_hw_resources function to prevent a potential
buffer overflow. The function was accessing arrays using an index that
could potentially be greater than the size of the arrays, leading to a
buffer overflow.

Adds a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the
arrays. If the index is out of bounds, an error message is printed and
break it will continue execution with just ignoring extra data early to
prevent the buffer overflow.

fbcon: always restore the old font data in fbcon_do_set_font()

Commit a5a923038d70 (fbdev: fbcon: Properly revert changes when
vc_resize() failed) started restoring old font data upon failure (of
vc_resize()). But it performs so only for user fonts. It means that the
"system"/internal fonts are not restored at all. So in result, the very
first call to fbcon_do_set_font() performs no restore at all upon
failing vc_resize().

This can be reproduced by Syzkaller to crash the system on the next
invocation of font_get(). It's rather hard to hit the allocation failure
in vc_resize() on the first font_set(), but not impossible. Esp. if
fault injection is used to aid the execution/failure. It was
demonstrated by Sirius:

When the decrypt request goes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt

stmmac: Clear variable when destroying workqueue

Currently when suspending driver and stopping workqueue it is checked whether
workqueue is not NULL and if so, it is destroyed.
Function destroy_workqueue() does drain queue and does clear variable, but
it does not set workqueue variable to NULL. This can cause kernel/module
panic if code attempts to clear workqueue that was not initialized.

This scenario is possible when resuming suspended driver in stmmac_resume(),
because there is no handling for failed stmmac_hw_setup(),
which can fail and return if DMA engine has failed to initialize,
and workqueue is initialized after DMA engine.
Should DMA engine fail to initialize, resume will proceed normally,
but interface won't work and TX queue will eventually timeout,
causing 'Reset adapter' error.
This then does destroy workqueue during reset process.
And since workqueue is initialized after DMA engine and can be skipped,
it will cause kernel/module panic.

To secure against this possible crash, set workqueue variable to NULL when
destroying workqueue.

net: veth: clear GRO when clearing XDP even when down

veth sets NETIF_F_GRO automatically when XDP is enabled,
because both features use the same NAPI machinery.

The logic to clear NETIF_F_GRO sits in veth_disable_xdp() which
is called both on ndo_stop and when XDP is turned off.
To avoid the flag from being cleared when the device is brought
down, the clearing is skipped when IFF_UP is not set.
Bringing the device down should indeed not modify its features.

Unfortunately, this means that clearing is also skipped when
XDP is disabled _while_ the device is down. And there's nothing
on the open path to bring the device features back into sync.
IOW if user enables XDP, disables it and then brings the device
up we'll end up with a stray GRO flag set but no NAPI instances.

We don't depend on the GRO flag on the datapath, so the datapath
won't crash. We will crash (or hang), however, next time features
are sync'ed (either by user via ethtool or peer changing its config).
The GRO flag will go away, and veth will try to disable the NAPIs.
But the open path never created them since XDP was off, the GRO flag
was a stray. If NAPI was initialized before we'll hang in napi_disable().
If it never was we'll crash trying to stop uninitialized hrtimer.

Move the GRO flag updates to the XDP enable / disable paths,
instead of mixing them with the ndo_open / ndo_close paths.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 08:27:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26804 | net: ip_tunnel: prevent perpetual headroom growth</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26804</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The splat occurs because skb-&gt;data points past skb-&gt;head allocated area.
This is because neigh layer does:
  __skb_pull(skb, skb_network_offset(skb));

... but skb_network_offset() returns a negative offset and __skb_pull()
arg is unsigned.  IOW, we skb-&gt;data gets "adjusted" by a huge value.

The negative value is returned because skb-&gt;head and skb-&gt;data distance is
more than 64k and skb-&gt;network_header (u16) has wrapped around.

The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can cause
dev-&gt;needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.

The syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gre
tunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)
tunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.

This results in the following pattern:

1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.
Route lookup found an output device, ipip0.

2).
ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0-&gt;needed_headroom based on the future
output device, rt.dev-&gt;needed_headroom (ipip0).

3).
ip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the same
code path again (xmit recursion).

4).
Routing step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device
to use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.

tunl0-&gt;needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)
gre0 device headroom.

This repeats for every future packet:

gre0-&gt;needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 step
incremented rt-&gt;dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0
needed_headroom was increased.

For each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0-&gt;needed_headroom grows until
post-expand-head reallocations result in a skb-&gt;head/data distance of
more than 64k.

Once that happens, skb-&gt;network_header (u16) wraps around when
pskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged
after the headroom expansion/reallocation.

After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)
result post headroom expansion.

The next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the
network header) makes skb-&gt;data point to a memory location outside
skb-&gt;head area.

v2: Cap the needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit to
prevent perpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom increment
completely.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 08:27:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26805 | netlink: Fix kernel-infoleak-after-free in __skb_datagram_iter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26805</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: Fix kernel-infoleak-after-free in __skb_datagram_iter

syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1]:

netlink_to_full_skb() creates a new `skb` and puts the `skb-&gt;data`
passed as a 1st arg of netlink_to_full_skb() onto new `skb`. The data
size is specified as `len` and passed to skb_put_data(). This `len`
is based on `skb-&gt;end` that is not data offset but buffer offset. The
`skb-&gt;end` contains data and tailroom. Since the tailroom is not
initialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized
memory area when copying the data.

This patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb-&gt;end` to
`skb-&gt;len`, which is the actual data offset.

spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks

The -&gt;runtime_suspend() and -&gt;runtime_resume() callbacks are not
expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().
Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.

Those helpers have two roles currently:
 - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.
 - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It
   requires acquiring ctlr-&gt;bus_lock_mutex.

Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two
however has two implications:
 - A deadlock occurs, because -&gt;runtime_resume() is called in a context
   where the lock is already taken (in the -&gt;exec_op() callback, where
   the usage count is incremented).
 - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.

Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:

spi_mem_exec_op()
        ...
        spi_mem_access_start()
                mutex_lock(&amp;ctlr-&gt;bus_lock_mutex)

Users are advised to upgrade to version 4.18.1.1 or 4.19.0.1, which fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 07:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25503 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Advanced REST Client v.17.0.9 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sens...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25503</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Advanced REST Client v.17.0.9 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the edit details parameter of the New Project function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 07:28:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-25730 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ZoneMinder before version 1.34.21, allows remote attackers execute arbitrary code, escalate priv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25730</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ZoneMinder before version 1.34.21, allows remote attackers execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information via PHP_SELF component in classic/views/download.php.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 07:21:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-25199 | A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the MT Safeline X-Ray X3310 webserver version NXG 19.05 that enables a remote...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25199</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the MT Safeline X-Ray X3310 webserver version NXG 19.05 that enables a remote attacker to execute JavaScript code and obtain sensitive information in a victim's browser.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 07:07:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-25200 | An HTML injection vulnerability exists in the MT Safeline X-Ray X3310 webserver version NXG 19.05 that enables a remote attacker to render m...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25200</link><description>An HTML injection vulnerability exists in the MT Safeline X-Ray X3310 webserver version NXG 19.05 that enables a remote attacker to render malicious HTML and obtain sensitive information in a victim's browser.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 07:07:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29375 | CSV Injection vulnerability in Addactis IBNRS v.3.10.3.107 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .ibnrs file to t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29375</link><description>CSV Injection vulnerability in Addactis IBNRS v.3.10.3.107 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .ibnrs file to the Project Description, Identifiers, Custom Triangle Name (inside Input Triangles) and Yield Curve Name parameters.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 06:26:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28520 | File Upload vulnerability in Byzoro Networks Smart multi-service security gateway intelligent management platform version S210, allows an at...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28520</link><description>File Upload vulnerability in Byzoro Networks Smart multi-service security gateway intelligent management platform version S210, allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via the uploadfile.php component.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 05:48:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1418 | The CGC Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 via ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1418</link><description>The CGC Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 via the REST API.
