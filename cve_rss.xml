This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13412 | CozyStay &amp;lt;= 1.7.0 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Action Execution in ajax_handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13412</link><description>The CozyStay theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0.

A Public Domain name is Used for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:32:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30137 | An issue was discovered in the G-Net GNET APK 2.6.2.

Hardcoded credentials exist in in APK for ports 9091 and 9092. The GNET mobile application contains hardcoded credentials that provide unauthorized access to the dashcam's API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. There's a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext: admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:17:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30138 | An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices.

Managing Settings and Obtaining Sensitive Data and Sabotaging Car Battery can be performed by unauthorized persons. It allows unauthorized users to modify critical system settings once connected to its network. Attackers can extract sensitive car and driver information, mute dashcam alerts to prevent detection, disable recording functionality, or even factory reset the device. Additionally, they can disable battery protection, causing the dashcam to drain the car battery when left on overnight. These actions not only compromise privacy but also pose potential physical harm by rendering the dashcam non-functional or causing vehicle battery failure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:17:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30139 | An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices.

One can Remotely Dump Video Footage and the Live Video Stream. It exposes API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092 that allow remote access to recorded and live video feeds. An attacker who connects to the dashcam's network can retrieve all stored recordings and convert them from JDR format to MP4. Additionally, port 9092's RTSP stream can be accessed remotely, allowing real-time video feeds to be extracted without the owner's knowledge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:17:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30142 | An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices.

Bypassing of Device Pairing can occur. It uses MAC address verification as the sole mechanism for recognizing paired devices, allowing attackers to bypass authentication. By capturing the MAC address of an already-paired device through ARP scanning or other means, an attacker can spoof the MAC address and connect to the dashcam without going through the pairing process. This enables full access to the device.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:17:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25040 | Failure to Properly Enforce Port ACLs on CPU generated packets in CX 9300 Switches</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25040</link><description>A vulnerability has been identified in the port ACL functionality of AOS-CX software running on the HPE Aruba Networking CX 9300 Switch Series only and affects: 

     - AOS-CX 10.14.xxxx : All patches
     - AOS-CX 10.15.xxxx : 10.15.1000 and below 
The vulnerability is specific to traffic originated by the CX 9300 switch platform and could allow an attacker to bypass ACL rules applied to routed ports on egress. As a result, port ACLs are not correctly enforced, which could lead to unauthorized traffic flow and violations of security policies. Egress VLAN ACLs and Routed VLAN ACLs are not affected by this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:08:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25042 | Authenticated Access Control Vulnerability allows Sensitive Information Disclosure in AOS-CX REST Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25042</link><description>A vulnerability in the AOS-CX REST interface could allow an authenticated remote attacker with low privileges to view sensitive information.

Prior to 1.0.1, if the $_GET['seoOp'] parameter is manipulated to include malicious input (e.g., seoOp=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/config.php), the application could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (Local File Inclusion, LFI). The $_GET['seoOp'] and $_GET['seoArg'] parameters are directly used without sanitization or validation. This is partly mitigated by the fact that the ImpressCMS sensitive files are stored outside the web root, in a folder with a randomized name.

In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 22:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29913 | CryptoLib&amp;#x27;s Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD Has Buffer Overflow Due to Integer Underflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29913</link><description>CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 22:57:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2420 | 猫宁i Morning cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2420</link><description>A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in 猫宁i Morning up to bc782730c74ff080494f145cc363a0b4f43f7d3e.

A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than `max_frame_size`.

A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 22:11:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29909 | CryptoLib&amp;#x27;s Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity() Has a Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29909</link><description>CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in CryptoLib's `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control software where attackers can inject malformed frames.

Baremetal Operator enables users to load Secret from arbitrary namespaces upon deployment of the namespace scoped Custom Resource `BMCEventSubscription`. Prior to versions 0.8.1 and 0.9.1, an adversary Kubernetes account with only namespace level roles (e.g. a tenant controlling a namespace) may create a `BMCEventSubscription` in his authorized namespace and then load Secrets from his unauthorized namespaces to his authorized namespace via the Baremetal Operator, causing Secret Leakage. The patch makes BMO refuse to read Secrets from other namespace than where the corresponding BMH resource is. The patch does not change the `BMCEventSubscription` API in BMO, but stricter validation will fail the request at admission time. It will also prevent the controller reading such Secrets, in case the BMCES CR has already been deployed. The issue exists for all versions of BMO, and is patched in BMO releases v0.9.1 and v0.8.1. Prior upgrading to patched BMO version, duplicate any existing Secret pointed to by `BMCEventSubscription`'s `httpHeadersRef` to the same namespace where the corresponding BMH exists. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, the operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces, and/or use `WATCH_NAMESPACE` configuration option to limit BMO to single namespace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:49:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40635 | containerd has an integer overflow in User ID handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40635</link><description>containerd is an open-source container runtime.

Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:53:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2381 | PHPGurukul Curfew e-Pass Management System search-pass.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2381</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in PHPGurukul Curfew e-Pass Management System 1.0.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.6.1, 1.7.1, and 2.0.1 allows users to manipulate the final payment amount processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart after initiating the PayPal Express Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount, while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total. This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value. Attackers can intentionally pay less than the actual total order amount, business owners may suffer financial losses due to underpaid orders, and integrity of payment processing is compromised. The issue is fixed in versions 1.6.1, 1.7.1, 2.0.1, and above. To resolve the problem in the end application without updating to the newest patches, there is a need to overwrite `ProcessPayPalOrderAction`, `CompletePayPalOrderFromPaymentPageAction`, and `CaptureAction` with modified logic.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-15706 | An improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the SSL VPN portal of FortiProxy version 2.0.0, version 1.2.9 and below an...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15706</link><description>An improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the SSL VPN portal of FortiProxy version 2.0.0, version 1.2.9 and below and FortiOS version 6.2.1 and below, version 6.0.8 and below, version 5.6.12 may allow a remote authenticated attacker to perform a stored cross site scripting attack (XSS).</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2019-17659 | A use of hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability in FortiSIEM version 5.2.6 may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain SSH acc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17659</link><description>A use of hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability in FortiSIEM version 5.2.6 may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain SSH access to the supervisor as the restricted user "tunneluser" by leveraging knowledge of the private key from another installation or a firmware image.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-29010 | An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability in FortiOS version 6.2.4 and below, version 6.0.10 and belowmay ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-29010</link><description>An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability in FortiOS version 6.2.4 and below, version 6.0.10 and belowmay allow remote authenticated actors to read the SSL VPN events log entries of users in other VDOMs by  executing "get vpn ssl monitor" from the CLI.

Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:33:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2378 | PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System download-medical-cards.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2378</link><description>A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System 1.0.
