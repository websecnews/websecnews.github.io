Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. In affected images, the /etc/passwd file was created during build time with group-writable permissions and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:15:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8697 | agentUniverse MCPSessionManager/MCPTool/MCPToolkit StdioServerParameters os command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8697</link><description>A vulnerability was found in agentUniverse up to 0.0.18 and classified as critical.

The di...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50675</link><description>GPMAW 14, a bioinformatics software, has a critical vulnerability related to insecure file permissions in its installation directory. The directory is accessible with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate files within the directory, including executable files like GPMAW3.exe, Fragment.exe, and the uninstaller GPsetup64_17028.exe. An attacker with user-level access can exploit this misconfiguration by replacing or modifying the uninstaller (GPsetup64_17028.exe) with a malicious version. While the application itself runs in the user's context, the uninstaller is typically executed with administrative privileges when an administrator attempts to uninstall the software. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin, resulting in privilege escalation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:54:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50692 | FoxCMS &lt;=v1.2.5 is vulnerable to Code Execution in admin/template_file/editFile.html.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50692</link><description>FoxCMS &lt;=v1.2.5 is vulnerable to Code Execution in admin/template_file/editFile.html.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:54:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55077 | Tyler Technologies ERP Pro 9 SaaS application escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55077</link><description>Tyler Technologies ERP Pro 9 SaaS allows an authenticated user to escape the application and execute limited operating system commands within the remote Microsoft Windows environment with the privileges of the authenticated user.

QUIC connections possess a set of connection identifiers (IDs); see  Section 5.1 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Once the QUIC handshake completes, a local endpoint is responsible for issuing and retiring Connection IDs that are used by the remote peer to populate the Destination Connection ID field in packets sent from remote to local. Each Connection ID has a sequence number to ensure synchronization between peers.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by first completing a handshake and then sending a specially-crafted set of frames that trigger a connection ID retirement in the victim. When the victim attempts to send a packet containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames,  Section 19.16 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-19.6  requires that the sequence number of the retired connection ID must not be the same as the sequence number of the connection ID used by the packet. In other words, a packet cannot contain a frame that retires itself. In scenarios such as path migration, it is possible for there to be multiple active paths with different active connection IDs that could be used to retire each other. The exploit triggered an unintentional behaviour of a quiche design feature that supports retirement across paths while maintaining full connection ID synchronization, leading to an infinite loop.This issue affects quiche: from 0.15.0 before 0.24.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44779 | An issue in Ollama v0.1.33 allows attackers to delete arbitrary files via sending a crafted packet to the endpoint /api/pull.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-44779</link><description>An issue in Ollama v0.1.33 allows attackers to delete arbitrary files via sending a crafted packet to the endpoint /api/pull.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-50952 | openjpeg v 2.5.0 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the component /openjp2/dwt.c.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-50952</link><description>openjpeg v 2.5.0 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the component /openjp2/dwt.c.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47188 | A vulnerability in the Mitel 6800 Series, 6900 Series, and 6900w Series SIP Phones, including the 6970 Conference Unit through 6.4 SP4, coul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47188</link><description>A vulnerability in the Mitel 6800 Series, 6900 Series, and 6900w Series SIP Phones, including the 6970 Conference Unit through 6.4 SP4, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to conduct a command injection attack due to insufficient parameter sanitization.

In versions 4.25.1 and below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the lego library and the lego cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request identifiers to network attackers.

Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.

This vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need the capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network, to monitor and intercept the targeted network traffic flows, and to satisfy timing requirements in order to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user. However, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20331 | Cisco Identity Services Engine Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabiliy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20331</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on the affected device.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20332 | Cisco Identity Services Engine Authorization Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20332</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify parts of the configuration on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify descriptions of files on a specific page. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid read-only Administrator&amp;nbsp;credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53786 | Microsoft Exchange Server Hybrid Deployment Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53786</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:38:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-51531 | A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sage DPW v2024.12.003 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the contex...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-51531</link><description>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sage DPW v2024.12.003 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser via injcting a crafted payload into the tabfields parameter at /dpw/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService.

The pic parameter is decrypted using the sys_auth($pic, 1) function, which utilizes a hard-coded key Mc_Encryption_Key (bD2voYwPpNuJ7B8), defined in the db.php file. The decrypted URL is passed to the geturl() method, which uses cURL to make a request to the URL without proper security checks. An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure.

In versions 2.52.8 and below, when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., test.18446744073704), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash. This is fixed in version 2.52.9.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 23:50:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54869 | FPDI is Vulnerable to Memory Exhaustion (OOM) through its PDF Parser</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54869</link><description>FPDI is a collection of PHP classes that facilitate reading pages from existing PDF documents and using them as templates in FPDF.

In versions 3.1.5 through 4.2.24, 4.3.0 through 4.3.11 and 4.4.0 through 4.4.3, Mastodon's rate-limiting system has a critical configuration error where the email-based throttle for confirmation emails incorrectly checks the password reset path instead of the confirmation path, effectively disabling per-email limits for confirmation requests. This allows attackers to bypass rate limits by rotating IP addresses and send unlimited confirmation emails to any email address, as only a weak IP-based throttle (25 requests per 5 minutes) remains active. The vulnerability enables denial-of-service attacks that can overwhelm mail queues and facilitate user harassment through confirmation email spam.

In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui &lt;= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (&lt;&lt;) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 23:50:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54884 | Vision UI security-kit.js: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Allocation Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54884</link><description>Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling loops that could hang the thread.

There isn't any feature in XWiki itself that depends on the XML export.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 23:36:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8571 | Concrete CMS 9 through 9.4.2 and below 8.5.21 is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Conversation Messages Dashboard Page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8571</link><description>Concrete CMS 9 to 9.4.2 and versions below 8.5.21 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Conversation Messages Dashboard Page. Unsanitized input could cause theft of session cookies or tokens, defacement of web content, redirection to malicious sites, and (if victim is an admin), the execution of unauthorized actions. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v.4.0 score of 4.8 with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N. Thanks  Fortbridge https://fortbridge.co.uk/  for performing a penetration test and vulnerability assessment on Concrete CMS and reporting this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 22:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8573 | Concrete CMS 9 through 9.4.2 is vulnerable to Stored XSS from Home Folder on Members Dashboard page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8573</link><description>Concrete CMS versions 9 through 9.4.2 are vulnerable to Stored XSS from Home Folder on Members Dashboard page.  Version 8 was not affected. A rogue admin could set up a malicious folder containing XSS to which users could be directed upon login. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v.4.0 score of 2.0 with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N. Thanks sealldev for reporting via HackerOne.</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 22:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53534 | RatPanel can perform remote command execution without authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53534</link><description>RatPanel is a server operation and maintenance management panel. In versions 2.3.19 through 2.5.5, when an attacker obtains the backend login path of RatPanel (including but not limited to weak default paths, brute-force cracking, etc.), they can execute system commands or take over hosts managed by the panel without logging in. In addition to this remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, the flawed code also leads to unauthorized access. RatPanel uses the CleanPath middleware provided by github.com/go-chi/chi package to clean URLs, but but the middleware does not process r.URL.Path, which can cause the paths to be misinterpreted.
