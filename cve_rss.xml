This is due to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations` system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. This is a Race Condition which enables Arbitrary File Overwrite. This vulnerability affects users and systems using node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+). Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. The patch in version 7.5.4 updates `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')` and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`. As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:21:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1195 | MineAdmin JWT Token refresh data authenticity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1195</link><description>A weakness has been identified in MineAdmin 1.x/2.x.

The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 02:21:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15466 | Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid &amp;lt;= 3.6.9 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary Gallery Management</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15466</link><description>The Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.9.

Prior to version 1.13.2, unauthenticated requests could be proxied to remote environment agents, allowing access to remote environment resources without authentication. The environment proxy middleware handled `/api/environments/{id}/...` requests for remote environments before authentication was enforced. When the environment ID was not local, the middleware proxied the request and attached the manager-held agent token, even if the caller was unauthenticated. This enabled unauthenticated access to remote environment operations (e.g., listing containers, streaming logs, or other agent endpoints). An unauthenticated attacker could access and manipulate remote environment resources via the proxy, potentially leading to data exposure, unauthorized changes, or service disruption. Version 1.13.2 patches the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:41:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23885 | AlchemyCMS has Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via eval injection in ResourcesHelper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23885</link><description>Alchemy is an open source content management system engine written in Ruby on Rails. Prior to versions 7.4.12 and 8.0.3, the application uses the Ruby `eval()` function to dynamically execute a string provided by the `resource_handler.engine_name` attribute in `Alchemy::ResourcesHelper#resource_url_proxy`. The vulnerability exists in `app/helpers/alchemy/resources_helper.rb` at line 28. The code explicitly bypasses security linting with `# rubocop:disable Security/Eval`, indicating that the use of a dangerous function was known but not properly mitigated. Since `engine_name` is sourced from module definitions that can be influenced by administrative configurations, it allows an authenticated attacker to escape the Ruby sandbox and execute arbitrary system commands on the host OS. Versions 7.4.12 and 8.0.3 fix the issue by replacing `eval()` with `send()`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1176 | itsourcecode School Management System index.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1176</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in itsourcecode School Management System 1.0.

Prior to version 2.55.0, the JSONAuth. Auth function contains a logic flaw that allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate valid usernames by measuring the response time of the /api/login endpoint. The vulnerability exists due to a "short-circuit" evaluation in the authentication logic. When a username is not found in the database, the function returns immediately. However, if the username does exist, the code proceeds to verify the password using bcrypt (users.CheckPwd), which is a computationally expensive operation designed to be slow. This difference in execution path creates a measurable timing discrepancy. Version 2.55.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:49:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23837 | MyTube has an Authorization Bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23837</link><description>MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. A vulnerability present in version 1.7.65 and poetntially earlier versions allows unauthenticated users to bypass the mandatory authentication check in the roleBasedAuthMiddleware. By simply not providing an authentication cookie (making req.user undefined), a request is incorrectly passed through to downstream handlers. All users running MyTube with loginEnabled: true are impacted. This flaw allows an attacker to access and modify application settings via /api/settings, change administrative and visitor passwords, and access other protected routes that rely on this specific middleware. The problem is patched in v1.7.66. MyTube maintainers recommend all users upgrade to at least version v1.7.64 immediately to secure their instances. The fix ensures that the middleware explicitly blocks requests if a user is not authenticated, rather than defaulting to next(). Those who cannot upgrade immediately can mitigate risk by restricting network access by usi a firewall or reverse proxy (like Nginx) to restrict access to the /api/ endpoints to trusted IP addresses only or, if they are comfortable editing the source code, manually patch by locating roleBasedAuthMiddleware and ensuring that the logic defaults to an error (401 Unauthorized) when req.user is undefined, instead of calling next().</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:34:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1174 | birkir prime GraphQL Alias graphql resource consumption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1174</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in birkir prime up to 0.4.0.beta.0.

Starting in version 1.7.0 and prior to version 1.12.0, Wings does not consider SQLite max parameter limit when processing activity log entries allowing for low privileged user to trigger a condition that floods the panel with activity records. After Wings sends activity logs to the panel it deletes the processed activity entries from the wings SQLite database. However, it does not consider the max parameter limit of SQLite, 32766 as of SQLite 3.32.0. If wings attempts to delete more than 32766 entries from the SQLite database in one query, it triggers an error (SQL logic error: too many SQL variables (1)) and does not remove any entries from the database. These entries are then indefinitely re-processed and resent to the panel each time the cron runs. By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can trigger a situation where wings will keep uploading the same activity data to the panel repeatedly (growing each time to include new activity) until the panels' database server runs out of disk space.

Pterodactyl implements rate limits that are applied to the total number of resources (e.g. databases, port allocations, or backups) that can exist for an individual server. These resource limits are applied on a per-server basis, and validated during the request cycle. However, in versions prior to 1.12.0, it is possible for a malicious user to send a massive volume of requests at the same time that would create more resources than the server is allotted. This is because the validation occurs early in the request cycle and does not lock the target resource while it is processing. As a result sending a large volume of requests at the same time would lead all of those requests to validate as not using any of the target resources, and then all creating the resources at the same time. As a result a server would be able to create more databases, allocations, or backups than configured. A malicious user is able to deny resources to other users on the system, and may be able to excessively consume the limited allocations for a node, or fill up backup space faster than is allowed by the system.

Starting in version 23.05 and prior to version 26.05, when using the default configuration of Tandoor Recipes, specifically using SQLite and default `MEDIA_ROOT`, the full database file may be externally accessible, potentially on the Internet. The root cause is that the NixOS module configures the working directory of Tandoor Recipes, as well as the value of `MEDIA_ROOT`, to be `/var/lib/tandoor-recipes`. This causes Tandoor Recipes to create its `db.sqlite3` database file in the same directory as `MEDIA_ROOT` causing it to be accessible without authentication through HTTP like any other media file. This is the case when using `GUNICORN_MEDIA=1` or when using a web server like nginx to serve media files. NixOS 26.05 changes the default value of `MEDIA_ROOT` to a sub folder of the data directory. This only applies to configurations with `system.stateVersion` &gt;= 26.05. For older configurations, one of the workarounds should be applied instead. NixOS 25.11 has received a backport of this patch, though it doesn't fix this vulnerability without user intervention. A recommended workaround is to move `MEDIA_ROOT` into a subdirectory. Non-recommended workarounds include switching to PostgreSQL or disallowing access to `db.sqlite3`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:22:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23878 | HotCRP vulnerable to exposure of submitted documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23878</link><description>HotCRP is conference review software.

In versions 2025.9.0 through 2025.12.6, an integer overflow in the API component's protobuf decoder allows denial-of-service attacks when API encryption is not used. The bounds check `ptr + field_length &gt; end` in `components/api/proto.cpp` can overflow when a malicious client sends a large `field_length` value. This affects all ESPHome device platforms (ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040, LibreTiny). The overflow bypasses the out-of-bounds check, causing the device to read invalid memory and crash. When using the plaintext API protocol, this attack can be performed without authentication. When noise encryption is enabled, knowledge of the encryption key is required. Users should upgrade to ESPHome 2025.12.7 or later to receive a patch, enable API encryption with a unique key per device, and follow the Security Best Practices.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:22:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23836 | HotCRP vulnerable to remote code execution through formulas</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23836</link><description>HotCRP is conference review software.

Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0.

Versions prior to 2.1.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary SQL execution through unescaped analytics export/import and permissive admin SQL import. Unauthenticated visitors can submit arbitrary path (`pa`) and referrer (`r`) values to the public tracking endpoint in src/Resources/functions/collect.php, which stores those strings verbatim in the analytics tables. The admin export logic in src/Admin/Data_Export.php writes these stored values directly into SQL INSERT statements without escaping. A crafted path such as "),('999','x');DROP TABLE wp_users;-- breaks out of the value list. When an administrator later imports that export file, the import handler in src/Admin/Data_Import.php reads the uploaded SQL with file_get_contents, performs only a superficial header check, splits on semicolons, and executes each statement via $wpdb-&gt;query with no validation of table names or statement types. Additionally, any authenticated user with manage_koko_analytics can upload an arbitrary .sql file and have it executed in the same permissive way. Combined, attacker-controlled input flows from the tracking endpoint into exported SQL and through the import execution sink, or directly via malicious uploads, enabling arbitrary SQL execution. In a worst-case scenario, attackers can achieve arbitrary SQL execution on the WordPress database, allowing deletion of core tables (e.g., wp_users), insertion of backdoor administrator accounts, or other destructive/privilege-escalating actions. Version 2.1.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:13:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23522 | Lobe Chat has IDOR in Knowledge Base File Removal that Allows Cross User File Deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23522</link><description>LobeChat is an open source chat application platform.

Problem Description
When using the JDBC engine and da
When using the JDBC engine and data source functionality, if the URL parameter configured on the frontend has undergone multiple rounds of URL encoding, it may bypass the system's checks. This bypass can trigger a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to system files via JDBC parameters.

Scope of Impact


This issue affects Apache Linkis: from 1.3.0 through 1.7.0.

Severity level


moderate
Solution
Continuously check if the connection information contains the "%" character; if it does, perform URL decoding.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.




More questions about this vulnerability can be discussed here:  https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@linkis.apache.org:2025-9:cve</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:04:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59355 | Apache Linkis: Password Exposure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59355</link><description>A vulnerability.

When org.apache.linkis.metadata.util.HiveUtils.decode() fails to perform Base64 decoding, it records the complete input parameter string in the log via logger.error(str + "decode failed", e). If the input parameter contains sensitive information such as Hive Metastore keys, plaintext passwords will be left in the log files when decoding fails, resulting in information leakage.


Affected Scope
Component: Sensitive fields in hive-site.xml (e.g., javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword) or other fields encoded in Base64.
Version: Apache Linkis 1.0.0 – 1.7.0


Trigger Conditions
The value of the configuration item is an invalid Base64 string.
Log files are readable by users other than hive-site.xml administrators.


Severity: Low
The probability of Base64 decoding failure is low.
The leakage is only triggered when logs at the Error level are exposed.

Remediation
Apache Linkis 1.8.0 and later versions have replaced the log with desensitized content.
logger.error("URL decode failed: {}", e.getMessage());   // 不再输出 str


Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:04:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1146 | SourceCodester/Patrick Mvuma Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System api_register_patient.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1146</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester/Patrick Mvuma Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System 1.0.

Prior to version 1.28. Mailpit's SMTP server is vulnerable to Header Injection due to an insufficient Regular Expression used to validate `RCPT TO` and `MAIL FROM` addresses. An attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP headers (or corrupt existing ones) by including carriage return characters (`\r`) in the email address. This header injection occurs because the regex intended to filter control characters fails to exclude `\r` and `\n` when used inside a character class. Version 1.28.3 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15538 | Open Asset Import Library Assimp LWOMaterial.cpp FindUVChannels use after free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15538</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in Open Asset Import Library Assimp up to 6.0.2.

A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 1Panel App Store when viewing application details. Malicious scripts can execute in the context of the user’s browser, potentially compromising session data or sensitive system interfaces. All versions of 1Panel up to and including v1.10.33-lts and v2.0.16 are affected. An attacker could publish a malicious application that, when loaded by users (locally or remotely), can execute arbitrary scripts. This may result in theft of user cookies, unauthorized access to system functions, or other actions that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of content rendered by the MdEditor component with the `previewOnly` attribute enabled. Specifically, the App Store renders application README content without proper XSS protection, allowing script execution during content rendering; and similar issues exist in system upgrade-related components, which can be fixed by implementing proper XSS sanitization in the MdEditor component. These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by applying proper XSS protection and sanitization when rendering content in the MdEditor component. Safe versions with a patch incorporated are v1.10.34-lts and v2.0.17.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:29:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1126 | lwj flow SVG File FormResource.java uploadFile unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1126</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in lwj flow up to a3d2fe8133db9d3b50fda4f66f68634640344641.
