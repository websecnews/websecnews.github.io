An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).

This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.

It is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.

If it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See  https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/  for instructions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:29:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47613 | A CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, Telit Ci...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47613</link><description>A CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion ELS61/81, Telit Cinterion PLS62 that could allow a local, low privileged attacker to escape from virtual directories and get read/write access to protected files on the targeted system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 06:40:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47489 | An issue in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the export-v2.php and aja...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47489</link><description>An issue in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the export-v2.php and ajax.render.php components.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:36:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47488 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted scr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47488</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Combodo iTop v.3.1.0-2-11973 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted script to the attrib_manager_id parameter in the General Information page and the id parameter in the contact page.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46492 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in MLDB.ai v.2017.04.17.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46492</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in MLDB.ai v.2017.04.17.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the public_html/doc/index.html.</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 05:25:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26156 | Versions of the package chromedriver before 119.0.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection when setting the chromedriver.path to an arbitrary s...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26156</link><description>Versions of the package chromedriver before 119.0.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection when setting the chromedriver.path to an arbitrary system binary.

The Fides web application allows data subject users to request access to their personal data. If the request is approved by the data controller user operating the Fides web application, the data subject's personal data can then retrieved from connected systems and data stores before being bundled together as a data subject access request package for the data subject to download. Supported data formats for the package include json and csv, but the most commonly used format is a series of HTML files compressed in a ZIP file. Once downloaded and unzipped, the data subject user can browse the HTML files on their local machine. It was identified that there was no validation of input coming from e.g. the connected systems and data stores which is later reflected in the downloaded data. This can result in an HTML injection that can be abused e.g. for phishing attacks or malicious JavaScript code execution, but only in the context of the data subject's browser accessing a HTML page using the `file://` protocol. Exploitation is limited to rogue Admin UI users, malicious connected system / data store users, and the data subject user if tricked via social engineering into submitting malicious data themselves. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.23.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47111 | ZITADEL race condition in lockout policy execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47111</link><description>ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. ZITADEL provides administrators the possibility to define a `Lockout Policy` with a maximum amount of failed password check attempts. On every failed password check, the amount of failed checks is compared against the configured maximum. Exceeding the limit, will lock the user and prevent further authentication. In the affected implementation it was possible for an attacker to start multiple parallel password checks, giving him the possibility to try out more combinations than configured in the `Lockout Policy`. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.40.5 and 2.38.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:50:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47109 | PrestaShop blockreassurance BO User can remove any file from server when adding a and deleting a block</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47109</link><description>PrestaShop blockreassurance adds an information block aimed at offering helpful information to reassure customers that the store is trustworthy.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.5.0, which fixes the issue.

There are several locations in the code where serialized Java objects are deserialized without verifying the data. This affects in particular:
  *  the deserialization of a Java-serialized CAS, but also other binary CAS formats that include TSI information using the CasIOUtils class;
  *  the CAS Editor Eclipse plugin which uses the the CasIOUtils class to load data;
  *  the deserialization of a Java-serialized CAS of the Vinci Analysis Engine service which can receive using Java-serialized CAS objects over network connections;
  *  the CasAnnotationViewerApplet and the CasTreeViewerApplet;
  *  the checkpointing feature of the CPE module.

Note that the UIMA framework by default does not start any remotely accessible services (i.e. Vinci) that would be vulnerable to this issue. A user or developer would need to make an active choice to start such a service. However, users or developers may use the CasIOUtils in their own applications and services to parse serialized CAS data. They are affected by this issue unless they ensure that the data passed to CasIOUtils is not a serialized Java object.

When using Vinci or using CasIOUtils in own services/applications, the unrestricted deserialization of Java-serialized CAS files may allow arbitrary (remote) code execution.

As a remedy, it is possible to set up a global or context-specific ObjectInputFilter (cf.  https://openjdk.org/jeps/290  and  https://openjdk.org/jeps/415 ) if running UIMA on a Java version that supports it. 

Note that Java 1.8 does not support the ObjectInputFilter, so there is no remedy when running on this out-of-support platform. An upgrade to a recent Java version is strongly recommended if you need to secure an UIMA version that is affected by this issue.

To mitigate the issue on a Java 9+ platform, you can configure a filter pattern through the "jdk.serialFilter" system property using a semicolon as a separator:

To allow deserializing Java-serialized binary CASes, add the classes:
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASCompleteSerializer
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASMgrSerializer
  *  org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASSerializer
  *  java.lang.String

To allow deserializing CPE Checkpoint data, add the following classes (and any custom classes your application uses to store its checkpoints):
  *  org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.CheckpointData
  *  org.apache.uima.util.ProcessTrace
  *  org.apache.uima.util.impl.ProcessTrace_impl
  *  org.apache.uima.collection.base_cpm.SynchPoint

Make sure to use "!*" as the final component to the filter pattern to disallow deserialization of any classes not listed in the pattern.

Apache UIMA 3.5.0 uses tightly scoped ObjectInputFilters when reading Java-serialized data depending on the type of data being expected. Configuring a global filter is not necessary with this version.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46483 | Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in timetec AWDMS v.2.0 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the re...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46483</link><description>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in timetec AWDMS v.2.0 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the remark parameter of the New Zone function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-41111 | An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, Automotive Processor, and Modem (Exynos 9810, 9610, 9820, 980, 850,...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41111</link><description>An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, Automotive Processor, and Modem (Exynos 9810, 9610, 9820, 980, 850, 1080, 2100, 2200, 1280, 1380, 1330, 9110, W920, Modem 5123, Modem 5300, and Auto T5123).
