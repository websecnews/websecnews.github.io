Starting in version 1.13.0 and prior to versions 1.13.7, 1.14.12, and 1.15.6, the output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled. Users of the TLS inspection, Ingress with TLS termination, Gateway API with TLS termination, and Kafka network policies with API key filtering features are affected. The sensitive data includes the CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API and the API keys used in Kafka-related network policy. `cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.6, v1.14.12, and v1.13.17.

CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal servers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37306 | CVAT&amp;#x27;s export and backup-related API endpoints are susceptible to CSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37306</link><description>Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, if an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can be chosen by the attacker. This implies that the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in any cloud storage that the victim can access and, if the attacker has read access to the cloud storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export. Version 2.14.3 contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37309 | Client initialized Session-Renegotiation DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37309</link><description>CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37849 | A SQL Injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Billing System 1.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in process.php via the us...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37849</link><description>A SQL Injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Billing System 1.0 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in process.php via the username parameter.</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22333 | IBM Maximo Application Suite information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22333</link><description>IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.1.3 and IBM Maximo Application Suite 8.10 and 8.11 allows web pages to be stored locally which can be read by another user on the system.

This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0, but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 15:29:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28964 | Dell Common Event Enabler, version 8.9.10.0 and prior, contain an insecure deserialization vulnerability in CAVATools.

A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML &amp; JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content &amp; data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 15:19:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5894 | SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop manage_product.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5894</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop 1.0.

The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks. This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user inputs a Markdown autolink such as ``, the link is rendered without proper sanitization. This means that the JavaScript code within the autolink can be executed by the browser, leading to an XSS attack. Version 2024.05.28 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 14:29:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36265 | Apache Submarine Server Core: authorization bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36265</link><description>** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Submarine Server Core.

This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2698 | Freeipa: delegation rules allow a proxy service to impersonate any user to access another target service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2698</link><description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 08:10:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3925 | Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp;amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) &amp;lt;= 5.6.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via onclick events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3925</link><description>The Element Pack Elementor Addons (Header Footer, Template Library, Dynamic Grid &amp; Carousel, Remote Arrows) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Creative Button widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

This vulnerability allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) where arbitrary JavaScript can be executed in the top frame from an embedded iframe on any displayed web site within the in-app browser. The in-app browser is usually opened by tapping on URLs contained in chat messages, and for the attack to be successful, the victim must trigger a click event on a malicious iframe. If an iframe embedded in any website can be controlled by an attacker, this vulnerability could be exploited to capture or alter content displayed in the top frame, as well as user session information. This vulnerability affects LINE iOS versions below 14.9.0 and does not affect other LINE clients such as LINE Android.
