The installer creates this directory without proper ownership verification, creating two exploitation scenarios:

Scenario 1 (Persistent Attack):
If a low-privileged attacker pre-creates C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop before Docker Desktop installation, the attacker retains ownership of the directory even after the installer applies restrictive ACLs. At any time after installation completes, the attacker can modify the directory ACL (as the owner) and tamper with critical configuration files such as install-settings.json to specify a malicious credentialHelper, causing arbitrary code execution when any user runs Docker Desktop.

Scenario 2 (TOCTOU Attack):
During installation, there is a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition between when the installer creates C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop and when it sets secure ACLs. A low-privileged attacker actively monitoring for the installation can inject malicious files (such as install-settings.json) with attacker-controlled ACLs during this window, achieving the same code execution outcome.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:29:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15368 | SportsPress &amp;lt;= 2.7.26 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Local File Inclusion via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15368</link><description>The SportsPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.26 via shortcodes 'template_name' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:43:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5329 | SQLi in Martcode Software&amp;#x27;s Delta Course Automation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5329</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Martcode Software Inc.

This issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.7.1.

An unauthenticated API endpoint incorrectly exposes full revision history for deleted content. This allows unauthorized user to retrieve restricted or sensitive information.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:24:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59818 | Authenticated Remote Code Execution via the file name of an uploaded file</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59818</link><description>This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system using the file name of an uploaded file.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:51:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41085 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Apidog web platform</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41085</link><description>Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability type in Apidog  in the version 2.7.15, where SVG image uploads are not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to embed malicious scripts in SVG files by sending a POST request to '/api/v1/user-avatar', which are then stored on the server and executed in the context of any user accessing the compromised resource.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:51:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1622 | Unredacted data exposure in query.log</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1622</link><description>Neo4j Enterprise and Community editions versions prior to 2026.01.3 and 5.26.21 are vulnerable to a potential information disclosure by a user who has ability to access the local log files.


The "obfuscate_literals" option in the query logs does not redact error information, exposing unredacted data in the query log when a customer writes a query that fails. It can allow a user with legitimate access to the local log files to obtain information they are not authorised to see. If this user is also in a position to run queries and trigger errors, this vulnerability can potentially help them to infer information they are not authorised to see through their intended database access.

We recommend upgrading to versions 2026.01.3 (or 5.26.21) where the issue is fixed, and reviewing query log files permissions to ensure restricted access. If your configuration had db.logs.query.obfuscate_literal enabled, and you wish the obfuscation to cover the error messages as well, you need to enable the new configuration setting db.logs.query.obfuscate_errors once you have upgraded Neo4j.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:00:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14461 | Xendit Payment &amp;lt;= 6.0.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Order Status Update to Paid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14461</link><description>The Xendit Payment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized order status manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2. This is due to the plugin exposing a publicly accessible WooCommerce API callback endpoint (`wc_xendit_callback`) that processes payment callbacks without any authentication or cryptographic verification that the requests originate from Xendit's payment gateway. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark any WooCommerce order as paid by sending a crafted POST request to the callback URL with a JSON body containing an `external_id` matching the order ID pattern and a `status` of 'PAID' or 'SETTLED', granted they can enumerate order IDs (which are sequential integers). This leads to orders being fraudulently marked as completed without any actual payment, resulting in financial loss and inventory depletion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:08:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15260 | MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce &amp;lt;= 5.6.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Loyalty Rule Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15260</link><description>The MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'ajax' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to modify, add, or delete loyalty program earning rules, including manipulating point multipliers to arbitrary values.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:08:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15268 | Infility Global &amp;lt;= 2.14.46 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection via Predictable API Key and IP Whitelist Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-15268</link><description>The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection via the 'infility_get_data' API action in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.46.

). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an 
SPDP packet sent by a publisher causes a heap buffer overflow, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If the fields 
of `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage — specifically by tampering with the `str_size` 
value read by `readString` (called from `readBinaryProperty`) — are modified, a 32-bit integer overflow can occur, causing

). ParticipantGenericMessage is the DDS Security control-message container that carries not only the handshake but also on
going security-control traffic after the handshake, such as crypto-token exchange, rekeying, re-authentication, and token 
delivery for newly appearing endpoints. On receive, the CDR parser is invoked first and deserializes the `message_data` (i
.e., the `DataHolderSeq`) via the `readParticipantGenericMessage → readDataHolderSeq` path. The `DataHolderSeq` is parsed 
sequentially: a sequence count (`uint32`), and for each DataHolder the `class_id` string (e.g. `DDS:Auth:PKI-DH:1.0+Req`),
 string properties (a sequence of key/value pairs), and binary properties (a name plus an octet-vector). The parser operat
es at a stateless level and does not know higher-layer state (for example, whether the handshake has already completed), s
o it fully unfolds the structure before distinguishing legitimate from malformed traffic. Because RTPS permits duplicates,
 delays, and retransmissions, a receiver must perform at least minimal structural parsing to check identity and sequence n
umbers before discarding or processing a message; the current implementation, however, does not "peek" only at a minimal
 header and instead parses the entire `DataHolderSeq`. As a result, prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, this parsi
ng behavior can trigger an out-of-memory condition and remotely terminate the process. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 p

An Insecure Direct Object Reference has been found to exist in `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver()` function within the Cloudflare Agents SDK. The issue occurs because the `Message-ID` and `References` headers are parsed to derive the target agentName and agentId without proper validation or origin checks, allowing an external attacker with control of these headers to route inbound mail to arbitrary Durable Object instances and namespaces .




Root cause

The `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver()` function lacks cryptographic verification or origin validation for the headers used in the routing logic, effectively allowing external input to dictate internal object routing.




Impact

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in email routing lets an attacker steer inbound mail to arbitrary Agent instances via spoofed Message-ID.





Mitigation:

  *  PR:  https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/email.md ] provides the necessary architectural context for coding agents to mitigate the issue by refactoring the resolver to enforce strict identity boundaries.
  *  Agents-sdk users should  upgrade to agents@0.3.7</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:53:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11598 | Exposure of Confidential Information in mObywatel application</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11598</link><description>In mObywatel iOS application an unauthorized user can use the App Switcher to view the account owner's personal information in the minimized app window, even after the login session has ended (reopening the app would require the user to log in).

Prior to 1.4.3, a critical vulnerability exists in the im-server component related to the file upload functionality found in com.xiaoleilu.loServer.action.UploadFileAction. The application exposes an endpoint (/fs) that handles multipart file uploads but fails to properly sanitize the filename provided by the user. Specifically, the writeFileUploadData method directly concatenates the configured storage directory with the filename extracted from the upload request without stripping directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../). This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to any location on the server's filesystem where the application process has write permissions. By uploading malicious files (such as scripts, executables, or overwriting configuration files like authorized_keys or cron jobs), an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and completely compromise the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-69207 | Khoj has an IDOR in Notion OAuth Flow Enables Index Poisoning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-69207</link><description>Khoj is a self-hostable artificial intelligence app. Prior to 2.0.0-beta.23, an IDOR in the Notion OAuth callback allows an attacker to hijack any user's Notion integration by manipulating the state parameter.

Prior to 4.1.0, the addJS method in the jspdf Node.js build utilizes a shared module-scoped variable (text) to store JavaScript content. When used in a concurrent environment (e.g., a Node.js web server), this variable is shared across all requests. If multiple requests generate PDFs simultaneously, the JavaScript content intended for one user may be overwritten by a subsequent request before the document is generated. This results in Cross-User Data Leakage, where the PDF generated for User A contains the JavaScript payload (and any embedded sensitive data) intended for User B.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with a malicious remote server to cause the local server to sign an arbitrary event upon user interaction. Upon a user account leaving a room (rejecting an invite), joining a room or knocking on a room, the victim server may ask a remote server for assistance. If the victim asks the attacker server for assistance the attacker is able to provide an arbitrary event, which the victim will sign and return to the attacker. For the /leave endpoint, this works for any event with a supported room version, where the origin and origin_server_ts is set by the victim. For the /join endpoint, an additionally victim-set content field in the format of a join membership is needed. For the /knock endpoint, an additional victim-set content field in the format of a knock membership and a room version not between 1 and 6 is needed. This was exploited as a part of a larger chain against the continuwuity.org homeserver. This vulnerability affects all Conduit-derived servers.

Prior to 4.1.10, certificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications. The TlsInsecureSkipVerify setting is default to true in the DefaultConfig() function in internal/conf/config.go. This vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25134 | Group-Office Argument Injection in MaintenanceController::actionZipLanguage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25134</link><description>Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5, the MaintenanceController exposes an action zipLanguage which takes a lang parameter and passes it directly to a system zip command via exec().

From 21.11 to before 25.11 and 26.05, every NixOS based Odoo setup publicly exposes the database manager without any authentication. This allows unauthorized actors to delete and download the entire database, including Odoos file store. Unauthorized access is evident from http requests. If kept, searching access logs and/or Odoos log for requests to /web/database can give indicators, if this has been actively exploited. The database manager is a featured intended for development and not meant to be publicly reachable. On other setups, a master password acts as 2nd line of defence. However, due to the nature of NixOS, Odoo is not able to modify its own configuration file and thus unable to persist the auto-generated password. This also applies when manually setting a master password in the web-UI. This means, the password is lost when restarting Odoo. When no password is set, the user is prompted to set one directly via the database manager. This requires no authentication or action by any authorized user or the system administrator. Thus, the database is effectively world readable by anyone able to reach Odoo. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11 and 26.05.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25142 | SandboxJS Prototype Pollution -&amp;gt; Sandbox Escape -&amp;gt; RCE</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25142</link><description>SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library.

In 0-PRERELEASE-15 and earlier, the OAuth 2.0 implementation for GitHub and Google login providers is vulnerable to Login Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application fails to implement and verify the state parameter during the authentication flow. This allows an attacker to pre-authenticate a session and trick a victim into logging into the attacker's account. Any data the victim then enters or academic progress they make is stored on the attacker's account, leading to data loss for the victim and information disclosure to the attacker.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:08:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25222 | PolarLearn Affected by User Enumeration via Argon2 Timing Attack on Sign-In Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25222</link><description>PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program.

This occurs because the server only performs the computationally expensive Argon2 password hashing if the user exists in the database.

When a user submits input consisting only of whitespace, the program skips command execution but fails to free the allocated buffer. Repeating this action causes memory to continuously accumulate. Over time, this can exhaust system memory and terminate the xmllint process, creating a denial-of-service condition on the local system.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:16:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2356 | Remote Code Execution due to LFI in &amp;#x27;/reinstall_extension&amp;#x27; in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2356</link><description>A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the '/reinstall_extension' endpoint of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `name` parameter of the `@router.post("/reinstall_extension")` route. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject a malicious `name` parameter, leading to the server loading and executing arbitrary Python files from the upload directory for discussions. This issue arises due to the concatenation of `data.name` directly with `lollmsElfServer.lollms_paths.extensions_zoo_path` and its use as an argument for `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()`. The server's handling of the `__init__.py` file in arbitrary locations, facilitated by `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader`, enables the execution of arbitrary code, such as command execution or creating a reverse-shell connection. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the application is exposed to an external endpoint or the UI, especially when bound to `0.0.0.0` or in `headless mode`. No user interaction is required for exploitation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4147 | Insufficient Access Control in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4147</link><description>In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability allows users to delete prompts created in other organizations through ID manipulation. The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate the ownership of the prompt before deletion, only checking if the user has permissions to delete such resources without verifying if it belongs to the user's project or organization. As a result, users can remove prompts not owned by their organization or project, leading to legitimate users being unable to access the removed prompts and causing information inconsistencies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5386 | Account Hijacking via Password Reset Token Leak in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5386</link><description>In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an account hijacking vulnerability exists due to a password reset token leak. A user with a 'viewer' role can exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account by obtaining the password reset token. The vulnerability is triggered when the 'viewer' role user sends a specific request to the server, which responds with a password reset token in the 'recoveryToken' parameter. This token can then be used to reset the password of another user's account without authorization. The issue results from an excessive attack surface, allowing lower-privileged users to escalate their privileges and take over accounts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5986 | Remote Arbitrary File Write with Arbitrary Data in h2oai/h2o-3</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5986</link><description>A vulnerability in h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows remote attackers to write arbitrary data to any file on the server. This is achieved by exploiting the `/3/Parse` endpoint to inject attacker-controlled data as the header of an empty file, which is then exported using the `/3/Frames/framename/export` endpoint. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for remote code execution and complete access to the system running h2o-3, as attackers can overwrite critical files such as private SSH keys or script files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10279 | Privilege Escalation in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10279</link><description>In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). This vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite `.py` files in the virtual environment, leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue is resolved in version 3.4.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-6208 | Uncontrolled Memory Consumption in run-llama/llama_index</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-6208</link><description>The `SimpleDirectoryReader` component in `llama_index.core` version 0.12.23 suffers from uncontrolled memory consumption due to a resource management flaw. The vulnerability arises because the user-specified file limit (`num_files_limit`) is applied after all files in a directory are loaded into memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and degraded performance, particularly in environments with limited resources. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.41.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7105 | Denial of Service via JavaScript Memory Overflow in danny-avila/librechat</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7105</link><description>A vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat allows attackers to exploit the unrestricted Fork Function in `/api/convos/fork` to fork numerous contents rapidly. If the forked content includes a Mermaid graph with a large number of nodes, it can lead to a JavaScript heap out of memory error upon service restart, causing a denial of service. This issue affects the latest version of the product.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0599 | Unbounded External Image Fetch in Validation Leads to Resource-Exhaustion DoS in huggingface/text-generation-inference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0599</link><description>A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching during input validation in VLM mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs for Markdown image links and performs a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire response body into memory and cloning it before decoding. This behavior can lead to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation, memory inflation, and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request is later rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially crashing the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1117 | Improper Access Control in parisneo/lollms</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1117</link><description>A vulnerability in the `lollms_generation_events.py` component of parisneo/lollms version 5.9.0 allows unauthenticated access to sensitive Socket.IO events. The `add_events` function registers event handlers such as `generate_text`, `cancel_generation`, `generate_msg`, and `generate_msg_from` without implementing authentication or authorization checks. This allows unauthenticated clients to execute resource-intensive or state-altering operations, leading to potential denial of service, state corruption, and race conditions. Additionally, the use of global flags (`lollmsElfServer.busy`, `lollmsElfServer.cancel_gen`) for state management in a multi-client environment introduces further vulnerabilities, enabling one client's actions to affect the server's state and other clients' operations. The lack of proper access control and reliance on insecure global state management significantly impacts the availability and integrity of the service.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:56:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54263 | WordPress Spirit Framework plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.13 - Local File Inclusion vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54263</link><description>Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in Talemy Spirit Framework allows PHP Local File Inclusion.This issue affects Spirit Framework: from n/a through 1.2.13.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:01:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1751 | Missing Authorization in GitLab</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1751</link><description>A vulnerability has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting with 16.8 before 18.5.0 that could have allowed unauthorized edits to merge request approval rules under certain conditions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9974 | Insufficient Input Validation on WEBUI in Nokia ONT/Beacon product</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9974</link><description>The unified WEBUI application of the ONT/Beacon device contains an input handling flaw that allows authenticated users to trigger unintended system-level command execution.
