When there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator, `S_do_trans_invmap` can overflow the destination pointer `d`.

   $ perl -e '$_ = "\x{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\xFF/\x{100}/;' 
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)

It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service and possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3423 | IBM Aspera Faspex 5 cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3423</link><description>IBM Aspera Faspex 5.0.0 through 5.0.11 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0119 | Cortex XDR Broker VM: Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability in Broker VM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0119</link><description>A command injection vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR® Broker VM allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the host operating system running Broker VM.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:43:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32367 | The Oz Forensics face recognition application before 4.0.8 late 2023 allows PII retrieval via /statistic/list Insecure Direct Object Referen...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32367</link><description>The Oz Forensics face recognition application before 4.0.8 late 2023 allows PII retrieval via /statistic/list Insecure Direct Object Reference.

Prior to 2.1.44, when importing a form from JSON, if the field label or handle contained malicious content, the output wasn't correctly escaped when viewing a preview of what was to be imported. As imports are undertaking primarily by users who have themselves exported the form from one environment to another, and would require direct manipulation of the JSON export, this is marked as moderate. This vulnerability will not occur unless someone deliberately tampers with the export.
