In versions 3.2.2 and below, the library allows deserialization of PHP objects from JSON using a special @type field. The deserializer instantiates any class specified in the @type field without restriction. When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application. If a vulnerable application passes attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous magic methods (such as __wakeup() or __destruct()), this may lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies. This behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP's native unserialize() when used without the allowed_classes restriction. Applications are impacted only if untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and the application or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain. This issue has been fixed in version 3.2.3. If an immediate upgrade isn't feasible, mitigate the vulnerability by never deserializing untrusted JSON with JsonSerializer::unserialize(), validating and sanitizing all JSON input before deserialization, and disabling @type-based object instantiation wherever possible.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 07:19:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27452 | ASN.1 TypeScript Library: Decoding an INTEGER could leak the underlying ArrayBuffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27452</link><description>ASN.1 TypeScript ESM library, including codecs for Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).

Versions 2.4.2 and below have a Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability through the Atom feed endpoint for lists (/lists/feed). An authenticated user can inject a CDATA-breaking payload into a list description that escapes the XML CDATA section, injects a native SVG element into the Atom XML document, and executes arbitrary JavaScript directly in the browser when the feed URL is visited. No RSS reader or additional rendering context is required — the browser's native XML parser processes the injected SVG and fires the onload event handler. This vulnerability exists because the lists feed template outputs list descriptions using Blade's raw syntax ({!! !!}) without sanitization inside a CDATA block. The critical detail is that because the output sits inside &lt;![CDATA[...]]&gt;, an attacker can inject the sequence ]]&gt; to close the CDATA section prematurely, then inject arbitrary XML/SVG elements that the browser parses and executes natively as part of the Atom document. This issue has been fixed in version 2.4.3.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 07:19:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27471 | ERP: Document access through endpoints due to missing validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27471</link><description>ERP is a free and open source Enterprise Resource Planning tool.

Versions 34.0 through 50.0 arevulnerable to arbitrary host file exfiltration (constrained by process privileges) when using virtio-block devices backed by raw images. A malicious guest can overwrite its disk header with a crafted QCOW2 structure pointing to a sensitive host path. Upon the next VM boot or disk scan, the image format auto-detection parses this header and serves the host file's contents to the guest. Guest-initiated VM reboots are sufficient to trigger a disk scan and do not cause the Cloud Hypervisor process to exit. Therefore, a single VM can perform this attack without needing interaction from the management stack. Successful exploitation requires the backing image to be either writable by the guest or sourced from an untrusted origin. Deployments utilizing only trusted, read-only images are not affected. This issue has been fixed in version 50.1. To workaround, enable land lock sandboxing and restrict process privileges and access.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27212 | Swiper has a Prototype Pollution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27212</link><description>Swiper is a free and mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and native behavior. Versions 6.5.1 through 12.1.1 have a Prototype pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs, where the indexOf() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings. Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype. The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes.  Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected  by the following: Authentication Bypass, Denial of Service and RCE. This issue is fixed in version 12.1.2.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27205 | Flask session does not add `Vary: Cookie` header when accessed in some ways</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27205</link><description>Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. In versions 3.1.2 and below, when the session object is accessed, Flask should set the Vary: Cookie header., resulting in a Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability. The logic instructs caches not to cache the response, as it may contain information specific to a logged in user. This is handled in most cases, but some forms of access such as the Python in operator were overlooked. The severity and risk depend on the application being hosted behind a caching proxy that doesn't ignore responses with cookies, not setting a Cache-Control header to mark pages as private or non-cacheable, and accessing the session in a way that only touches keys without reading values or mutating the session. The issue has been fixed in version 3.1.3.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27210 | Pannellum has a XSS vulnerability in hot spot attributes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27210</link><description>Pannellum is a lightweight, free, and open source panorama viewer for the web. In versions 3.5.0 through 2.5.6, the hot spot attributes configuration property allowed any attribute to be set, including HTML event handler attributes, allowing for potential XSS attacks. This affects websites hosting the standalone viewer HTML file and any other use of untrusted JSON config files (bypassing the protections of the escapeHTML parameter). As certain events fire without any additional user interaction, visiting a standalone viewer URL that points to a malicious config file — without additional user interaction — is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which can, for example, replace the contents of the page with arbitrary content and make it appear to be hosted by the website hosting the standalone viewer HTML file. This issue has been fixed in version 2.5.7. To workaround, setting the Content-Security-Policy header to script-src-attr 'none' will block execution of inline event handlers, mitigating this vulnerability. Don't host pannellum.htm on a domain that shares cookies with user authentication to mitigate XSS risk.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27198 | Formwork Improperly Manages Privileges During User Creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27198</link><description>Formwork is a flat file-based Content Management System (CMS). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.3, the application fails to properly enforce role-based authorization during account creation. Although the system validates that the specified role exists, it does not verify whether the current user has sufficient privileges to assign highly privileged roles such as admin. As a result, an authenticated user with the editor role can create a new account with administrative privileges, leading to full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27199 | Werkzeug safe_join() allows Windows special device names</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27199</link><description>Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Versions 3.1.5 and below, the safe_join function allows Windows device names as filenames if preceded by other path segments. This was previously reported as GHSA-hgf8-39gv-g3f2, but the added filtering failed to account for the fact that safe_join accepts paths with multiple segments, such as example/NUL. The function send_from_directory uses safe_join to safely serve files at user-specified paths under a directory. If the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with a special device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.6.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:56:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27196 | Statamic affected by privilege escalation via stored Cross-site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27196</link><description>Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Versions 5.73.8 and below in addition to 6.0.0-alpha.1 through 6.3.1 have a Stored XSS vulnerability in html fieldtypes which allows authenticated users with field management permissions to inject malicious JavaScript that executes when viewed by higher-privileged users. This issue has been fixed in 6.3.2 and 5.73.9.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27197 | Sentry: Improper Authentication on SAML SSO process allows user identity linking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27197</link><description>Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Versions 21.12.0 through 26.1.0 have a critical vulnerability in its SAML SSO implementation  which allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider and another organization on the same Sentry instance. Self-hosted users are only at risk if the following criteria is met: ore than one organizations are configured (SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION = True), or malicious user has existing access and permissions to modify SSO settings for another organization in a multo-organization instance. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0. To workaround this issue, implement user account-based two-factor authentication to prevent an attacker from being able to complete authentication with a victim's user account. Organization administrators cannot do this on a user's behalf, this requires individual users to ensure 2FA has been enabled for their account.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2860 | feng_ha_ha/megagao ssm-erp/production_ssm EmployeeController.java improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2860</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in feng_ha_ha/megagao ssm-erp and production_ssm up to 4288d53bd35757b27f2d070057aefb2c07bdd097.

In versions 5.0.39 and below, all HTTP request headers are stored in the session cookie, which is signed but not encrypted, exposing internal proxy/gateway headers to clients. The OAuth service stores the complete headers object in the session, then the session is persisted using cookie-session, which base64-encodes the data. While the cookie is signed to prevent tampering, the contents are readable by anyone by simply decoding the base64 value. Under specific deployment configurations (e.g., behind reverse proxies or API gateways), this can lead to exposure of sensitive internal infrastructure details such as API keys, service tokens, and internal IP addresses. This issue has been fixed in version 5.0.40.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:12:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27194 | D-Tale affected by Remote Code Execution through the /save-column-filter endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27194</link><description>D-Tale is a visualizer for pandas data structures. Versions prior to 3.20.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through the /save-column-filter endpoint. Users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. This issue has been fixed in version 3.20.0.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 05:12:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27191 | Feathers: Open Redirect in OAuth callback enables account takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27191</link><description>Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. Versions 5.0.39 and below the redirect query parameter is appended to the base origin without validation, allowing attackers to steal access tokens via URL authority injection. This leads to full account takeover, as the attacker obtains the victim's access token and can impersonate them. The application constructs the final redirect URL by concatenating the base origin with the user-supplied redirect parameter. This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and origin values do not end with /. An attacker can supply @attacker.com as the redirect value results in https://target.com@attacker.com#access_token=..., where the browser interprets attacker.com as the host, leading to full account takeover. This issue has been fixed in version 5.0.40.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 04:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27192 | Feathers has an origin validation bypass via prefix matching</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27192</link><description>Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, origin validation uses startsWith() for comparison, allowing attackers to bypass the check by registering a domain that shares a common prefix with an allowed origin.The getAllowedOrigin() function checks if the Referer header starts with any allowed origin, and this comparison is insufficient as it only validates the prefix. This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and an attacker registers a domain starting with an allowed origin string (e.g., https://target.com.attacker.com bypasses https://target.com). On its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured origin. However, in specific scenarios an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens, achieving full account takeover. This issue has bee fixed in version 5.0.40.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 04:11:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65995 | Apache Airflow: Disclosure of secrets to UI via kwargs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-65995</link><description>When a DAG failed during parsing, Airflow’s error-reporting in the UI could include the full kwargs passed to the operators.

In versions  0.49.0 through 0.50.0, when using a custom Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs, Strimzi incorrectly configures the trusted certificates for mTLS authentication on the internal as well as user-configured listeners. All CAs from the CA chain will be trusted. And users with certificates signed by any of the CAs in the chain will be able to authenticate. This issue affects only users using a custom Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs. It does not affect users using the Strimzi-managed Cluster and Clients CAs. It also does not affect users using custom Cluster or Clients CA with only a single CA (i.e., no CA chain with multiple CAs). This issue has been fixed in version 0.50.1.

All versions of GetSimple CMS do not implement CSRF protection on the administrative file upload endpoint. As a result, an attacker can craft a malicious web page that silently triggers a file upload request from an authenticated victim’s browser.

Starting in commit cf3441250bb5d8b45f6f8b389fcdf427a99ac28a and prior to commit a4f6b8d8c90b3eaa33d13dfd1093062ab9c4b30c on the master branch, arbitrary command injection can lead to code execution when a user enters a directory in a Git repository containing a crafted branch name. Exploitation requires the LP_ENABLE_GITSTATUSD config option to be enabled (enabled by default), gitstatusd to be installed and started before Liquid Prompt is loaded (not the default), and shell prompt substitution to be active (enabled by default in Bash via "shopt -s promptvars", not enabled by default in Zsh). A branch name containing shell syntax such as "$(...)" or backtick expressions in the default branch or a checked-out branch will be evaluated by the shell when the prompt is rendered. No stable release is affected; only the master branch contains the vulnerable commit. Commit a4f6b8d8c90b3eaa33d13dfd1093062ab9c4b30c contains a fix. As a workaround, set the LP_ENABLE_GITSTATUSD config option to 0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 21:52:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2858 | wren-lang wren Source File wren_compiler.c peekChar out-of-bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2858</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in wren-lang wren up to 0.4.0.

From v1.9.0 to v1.9.2, Kargo's authorization model includes a promote verb -- a non-standard Kubernetes "dolphin verb" -- that gates the ability to advance Freight through a promotion pipeline. This verb exists to separate the ability to manage promotion-related resources from the ability to trigger promotions, enabling fine-grained access control over what is often a sensitive operation. The promote verb is correctly enforced in Kargo's legacy gRPC API. However, three endpoints in the newer REST API omit this check, relying only on standard Kubernetes RBAC for the underlying resource operations (patch on freights/status or create on promotions). This permits users who hold those standard permissions -- but who were deliberately not granted promote -- to bypass the intended authorization boundary. The affected endpoints are /v1beta1/projects/{project}/freight/{freight}/approve, /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions, and /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions/downstream. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.9.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 21:31:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27112 | Kargo has an Authorization Bypass Vulnerability in Batch Resource Creation API Endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27112</link><description>Kargo manages and automates the promotion of software artifacts. From 1.7.0 to before v1.7.8, v1.8.11, and v1.9.3, the batch resource creation endpoints of both Kargo's legacy gRPC API and newer REST API accept multi-document YAML payloads. Specially crafted payloads can manifest a bug present in the logic of both endpoints to inject arbitrary resources (of specific types only) into the underlying namespace of an existing Project using the API server's own permissions when that behavior was not intended. Critically, an attacker may exploit this as a vector for elevating their own permissions, which can then be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration. Exfiltrated artifact repository credentials can be leveraged, in turn, to execute further attacks. In some configurations of the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster, elevated permissions may additionally be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration using kubectl. This can reduce the complexity of the attack, however, worst case scenarios remain entirely achievable even without this. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.7.8, v1.8.11, and v1.9.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 21:31:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27118 | Cache poisoning in @sveltejs/adapter-vercel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27118</link><description>SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. Versions of @sveltejs/adapter-vercel prior to 6.3.2 are vulnerable to cache poisoning. An internal query parameter intended for Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is accessible on all routes, allowing an attacker to cause sensitive user-specific responses to be cached and served to other users. Successful exploitation requires a victim to visit an attacker-controlled link while authenticated. Existing deployments are protected by Vercel's WAF, but users should upgrade as soon as possible.

Versions 1.7.0 and below allow users to upload files without proper content validation or sanitization. By embedding malicious JavaScript within an SVG (or other active content formats such as HTML or XML), an attacker can achieve script execution in the context of the application's origin when a victim views the file in “raw” mode. This results in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited to exfiltrate user data.

In versions 1.6.7 and below, uTLS did not implement the TLS 1.3 downgrade protection mechanism specified in RFC 8446 Section 4.1.3 when using a uTLS ClientHello spec. This allowed an active network adversary to downgrade TLS 1.3 connections initiated by a uTLS client to a lower TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2) by modifying the ClientHello message to exclude the SupportedVersions extension, causing the server to respond with a TLS 1.2 ServerHello (along with a downgrade canary in the ServerHello random field). Because uTLS did not check the downgrade canary in the ServerHello random field, clients would accept the downgraded connection without detecting the attack. This attack could also be used by an active network attacker to fingerprint uTLS connections. This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:28:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26996 | minimatch has a ReDoS via repeated wildcards with non-matching literal in pattern</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26996</link><description>minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects. Versions 10.2.0 and below are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive * wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch() call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. Any application that passes user-controlled strings to minimatch() as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This issue has been fixed in version 10.2.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27017 | uTLS has a Chrome Parrot Fingerprint Vulnerability due to GREASE ECH Cipher Suite Mismatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27017</link><description>uTLS is a fork of crypto/tls, created to customize ClientHello for fingerprinting resistance while still using it for the handshake. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0 contain a fingerprint mismatch with Chrome when using GREASE ECH, related to cipher suite selection. When Chrome selects the preferred cipher suite in the outer ClientHello and for ECH, it does so consistently based on hardware support—for example, if it prefers AES for the outer cipher suite, it also uses AES for ECH. However, the Chrome parrot in uTLS hardcodes AES preference for outer cipher suites but selects the ECH cipher suite randomly between AES and ChaCha20. This creates a 50% chance of selecting ChaCha20 for ECH while using AES for the outer cipher suite, a combination impossible in Chrome. This issue only affects GREASE ECH; in real ECH, Chrome selects the first valid cipher suite when AES is preferred, which uTLS handles correctly. This issue has been fixed in version 1.8.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:28:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2384 | Quiz Maker &amp;lt;= 6.7.1.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2384</link><description>The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's `vc_quizmaker` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

Prior to version 2026.2.15, in some shared-agent deployments, OpenClaw session tools (`sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`) allowed broader session targeting than some operators intended. This is primarily a configuration/visibility-scoping issue in multi-user environments where peers are not equally trusted. In Telegram webhook mode, monitor startup also did not fall back to per-account `webhookSecret` when only the account-level secret was configured. In shared-agent, multi-user, less-trusted environments: session-tool access could expose transcript content across peer sessions. In single-agent or trusted environments, practical impact is limited. In Telegram webhook mode, account-level secret wiring could be missed unless an explicit monitor webhook secret override was provided.

Prior to version 2026.2.15, `normalizeForHash` in `src/agents/sandbox/config-hash.ts` recursively sorted arrays that contained only primitive values. This made order-sensitive sandbox configuration arrays hash to the same value even when order changed. In OpenClaw sandbox flows, this hash is used to decide whether existing sandbox containers should be recreated. As a result, order-only config changes (for example Docker `dns` and `binds` array order) could be treated as unchanged and stale containers could be reused. This is a configuration integrity issue affecting sandbox recreation behavior. Starting in version 2026.2.15, array ordering is preserved during hash normalization; only object key ordering remains normalized for deterministic hashing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27008 | OpenClaw hardened the skill download target directory validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27008</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant.

Prior to version 2026.2.14, authenticated attackers can read arbitrary files from the Gateway host by supplying absolute paths or path traversal sequences to the browser tool's `upload` action. The server passed these paths to Playwright's `setInputFiles()` APIs without restricting them to a safe root. An attacker must reach the Gateway HTTP surface (or otherwise invoke the same browser control hook endpoints); present valid Gateway auth (bearer token / password), as required by the Gateway configuration (In common default setups, the Gateway binds to loopback and the onboarding wizard generates a gateway token even for loopback); and have the `browser` tool permitted by tool policy for the target session/context (and have browser support enabled). If an operator exposes the Gateway beyond loopback (LAN/tailnet/custom bind, reverse proxy, tunnels, etc.), the impact increases accordingly. Starting in version 2026.2.14, the upload paths are now confined to OpenClaw's temp uploads root (`DEFAULT_UPLOAD_DIR`) and traversal/escape paths are rejected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26972 | OpenClaw has a Path Traversal in Browser Download Functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26972</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant.

Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are unauthenticated. Prior to version 2026.2.14, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs. iOS and macOS used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL. iOS and Android allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin. On a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection. As of time of publication, the iOS and Android apps are alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN. Version 2026.2.14 fixes the issue. Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints. Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins. In iOS/Android, first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU) and discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only. In Android, hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26953 | Pi-hole Web Interface has Stored HTML Injection via X-Forwarded-For Header in Active Sessions Table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26953</link><description>Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad and internet tracker blocking application.  Versions 6.0 and above have a Stored HTML Injection vulnerability in the active sessions table located on the API settings page, allowing an attacker with valid credentials to inject arbitrary HTML code that will be rendered in the browser of any administrator who visits the active sessions page. The rowCallback function contains the value data.x_forwarded_for, which is directly concatenated into an HTML string and inserted into the DOM using jQuery’s .html() method. This method interprets the content as HTML, which means that any HTML tags present in the value will be parsed and rendered by the browser. An attacker can use common tools such as curl, wget, Python requests, Burp Suite, or even JavaScript fetch() to send an authentication request with an X-Forwarded-For header that contains malicious HTML code instead of a legitimate IP address. Since Pi-hole implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited to pure HTML injection without the ability to execute scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 6.4.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26958 | filippo.io/edwards25519 MultiScalarMult function produces invalid results or undefined behavior if receiver is not the identity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26958</link><description>filippo.io/edwards25519 is a Go library implementing the edwards25519 elliptic curve with APIs for building cryptographic primitives. In versions 1.1.0 and earlier, MultiScalarMult produces invalid results or undefined behavior if the receiver is not the identity point. If (*Point).MultiScalarMult is called on an initialized point that is not the identity point, it returns an incorrect result. If the method is called on an uninitialized point, the behavior is undefined. In particular, if the receiver is the zero value, MultiScalarMult returns an invalid point that compares Equal to every other point. Note that MultiScalarMult is a rarely used, advanced API. For example, users who depend on filippo.io/edwards25519 only through github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql are not affected.

Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly). In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible. Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Disallowed protocols, credentials, query/hash, and non-root paths are rejected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26323 | OpenClaw has a command injection in maintainer clawtributors updater</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26323</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Versions 2026.1.8 through 2026.2.13 have a command injection in the maintainer/dev script `scripts/update-clawtributors.ts`. The issue affects contributors/maintainers (or CI) who run `bun scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` in a source checkout that contains a malicious commit author email (e.g. crafted `@users[.]noreply[.]github[.]com` values). Normal CLI usage is not affected (`npm i -g openclaw`): this script is not part of the shipped CLI and is not executed during routine operation. The script derived a GitHub login from `git log` author metadata and interpolated it into a shell command (via `execSync`). A malicious commit record could inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary commands when the script is run.

Versions 6.4 and below are vulnerable to stored HTML injection through the local DNS records configuration page, which allows an authenticated administrator to inject code that is stored in the Pi-hole configuration and rendered every time the DNS records table is viewed. The populateDataTable() function contains a data variable with the full DNS record value exactly as entered by the user and returned by the API. This value is inserted directly into the data-tag HTML attribute without any escaping or sanitization of special characters. When an attacker supplies a value containing double quotes ("), they can prematurely “close” the data-tag attribute and inject additional HTML attributes into the element. Since Pi-hole implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited.

In versions 3.0.4 and below, an issuing certificate with a validity that expires before the leaf certificate will be considered valid during verification even if the provided timestamp would mean the issuing certificate should be considered expired. When verifying artifact signatures using a certificate, Cosign first verifies the certificate chain using the leaf certificate's "not before" timestamp and later checks expiry of the leaf certificate using either a signed timestamp provided by the Rekor transparency log or from a timestamp authority, or using the current time. The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during the leaf certificate's validity. There is no impact to users of the public Sigstore infrastructure.

OpenClaw macOS desktop client registers the `openclaw://` URL scheme. For `openclaw://agent` deep links without an unattended `key`, the app shows a confirmation dialog that previously displayed only the first 240 characters of the message, but executed the full message after the user clicked "Run." At the time of writing, the OpenClaw macOS desktop client is still in beta. In versions 2026.2.6 through 2026.2.13, an attacker could pad the message with whitespace to push a malicious payload outside the visible preview, increasing the chance a user approves a different message than the one that is actually executed. If a user runs the deep link, the agent may perform actions that can lead to arbitrary command execution depending on the user's configured tool approvals/allowlists. This is a social-engineering mediated vulnerability: the confirmation prompt could be made to misrepresent the executed message. The issue is fixed in 2026.2.14. Other mitigations include not approve unexpected "Run OpenClaw agent?" prompts triggered while browsing untrusted sites and usingunattended deep links only with a valid `key` for trusted personal automations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26321 | OpenClaw has a local file disclosure via sendMediaFeishu in Feishu extension</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26321</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Feishu extension previously allowed `sendMediaFeishu` to treat attacker-controlled `mediaUrl` values as local filesystem paths and read them directly. If an attacker can influence tool calls (directly or via prompt injection), they may be able to exfiltrate local files by supplying paths such as `/etc/passwd` as `mediaUrl`. Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive a fix.

Versions 2026.2.13 and below allow the optional @openclaw/voice-call plugin Telnyx webhook handler to accept unsigned inbound webhook requests when telnyx.publicKey is not configured, enabling unauthenticated callers to forge Telnyx events. Telnyx webhooks are expected to be authenticated via Ed25519 signature verification. In affected versions, TelnyxProvider.verifyWebhook() could effectively fail open when no Telnyx public key was configured, allowing arbitrary HTTP POST requests to the voice-call webhook endpoint to be treated as legitimate Telnyx events. This only impacts deployments where the Voice Call plugin is installed, enabled, and the webhook endpoint is reachable from the attacker (for example, publicly exposed via a tunnel/proxy).

An issue was discovered in `httpsig-hyper` prior to version 0.0.23 where Digest header verification could incorrectly succeed due to misuse of Rust's `matches!` macro. Specifically, the comparison `if matches!(digest, _expected_digest)` treated `_expected_digest` as a pattern binding rather than a value comparison, resulting in unconditional success of the match expression. As a consequence, digest verification could incorrectly return success even when the computed digest did not match the expected value. Applications relying on Digest verification as part of HTTP message signature validation may therefore fail to detect message body modification. The severity depends on how the library is integrated and whether additional signature validation layers are enforced. This issue has been fixed in `httpsig-hyper` 0.0.23. The fix replaces the incorrect `matches!` usage with proper value comparison and additionally introduces constant-time comparison for digest verification as defense-in-depth. Regression tests have also been added to prevent reintroduction of this issue. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to the patched version. There is no reliable workaround without upgrading. Users who cannot immediately upgrade should avoid relying solely on Digest verification for message integrity and ensure that full HTTP message signature verification is enforced at the application layer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26316 | OpenClaw has BlueBubbles webhook auth bypass via loopback proxy trust</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26316</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant.

This does not affect the default iMessage integration unless BlueBubbles is installed and enabled. Version 2026.2.13 contains a patch.

Prior to 2026.2.14, browser-facing localhost mutation routes accepted cross-origin browser requests without explicit Origin/Referer validation. Loopback binding reduces remote exposure but does not prevent browser-initiated requests from malicious origins.

If given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data or URLs to the `addImage` method, a user can provide a harmful GIF file that results in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful GIF files have large width and/or height entries in their headers, which lead to excessive memory allocation. Other affected methods are: `html`. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF 4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize image data or URLs before passing it to the addImage method or one of the other affected methods.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:59:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25755 | jsPDF has PDF Object Injection via Unsanitized Input in addJS Method</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25755</link><description>jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of the argument of the `addJS` method allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PDF objects into the generated document.

This is due to the plugin only validating webhook signatures when the stripe-webhook-signing-secret setting is configured, which is empty by default. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to forge Stripe webhook events to manipulate membership subscriptions, including reactivating expired memberships without payment or canceling legitimate subscriptions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and service disruption.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:27:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2716 | Client Testimonial Slider &amp;lt;= 2.0 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via &amp;#x27;Testimonial Heading&amp;#x27; Setting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2716</link><description>The Client Testimonial Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Testimonial Heading' setting in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.

The vulnerability exists in the Web UI's label update endpoint POST /:username/:reponame/labels/edit. The handler function UpdateLabel uses an incorrect database query function that bypasses repository ownership validation. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25232 | Gogs has a Protected Branch Deletion Bypass in Web Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25232</link><description>Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Versions 0.13.4 and below have an access control bypass vulnerability which allows any repository collaborator with Write permissions to delete protected branches (including the default branch) by sending a direct POST request, completely bypassing the branch protection mechanism. This vulnerability in the DeleteBranchPost function eenables privilege escalation from Write to Admin level, allowing low-privilege users to perform dangerous operations that should be restricted to administrators only. Although Git Hook layer correctly prevents protected branch deletion via SSH push, the web interface deletion operation does not trigger Git Hooks, resulting in complete bypass of protection mechanisms. In oder to exploit this vulnerability, attackers must have write permissions to the target repository, protected branches configured to the target repository and access to the Gogs web interface. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25242 | Gogs allows unauthenticated file uploads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25242</link><description>Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Versions 0.13.4 and below expose unauthenticated file upload endpoints by default. When the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments. This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25474 | OpenClaw has a Telegram webhook request forgery (missing `channels.telegram.webhookSecret`) → auth bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25474</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. In versions 2026.1.30 and below, if channels.telegram.webhookSecret is not set when in Telegram webhook mode, OpenClaw may accept webhook HTTP requests without verifying Telegram’s secret token header. In deployments where the webhook endpoint is reachable by an attacker, this can allow forged Telegram updates (for example spoofing message.from.id). If an attacker can reach the webhook endpoint, they may be able to send forged updates that are processed as if they came from Telegram. Depending on enabled commands/tools and configuration, this could lead to unintended bot actions. Note: Telegram webhook mode is not enabled by default. It is enabled only when `channels.telegram.webhookUrl` is configured. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2693 | CoCoTeaNet CyreneAdmin System Info Endpoint getCount improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2693</link><description>A vulnerability was determined in CoCoTeaNet CyreneAdmin up to 1.3.0.

It fails to properly authenticate clients over the XPC protocol and does not correctly enforce macOS’s authorization model, exposing privileged functionality to untrusted users. Although it invokes the AuthorizationCopyRights API, it does so using overly permissive custom rights that it registers in the system’s authorization database (/var/db/auth.db).


These rights can be requested and granted by the authorization daemon to any local user, regardless of privilege level. As a result, an attacker can exploit the vulnerable service to perform privileged operations such as executing arbitrary commands or installing system components without requiring administrative credentials.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25120 | Gogs Allows Cross-Repository Comment Deletion via DeleteComment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25120</link><description>Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions 0.13.4 and below, the DeleteComment API does not verify that the comment belongs to the repository specified in the URL. This allows a repository administrator to delete comments from any other repository by supplying arbitrary comment IDs, bypassing authorization controls. The DeleteComment function retrieves a comment by ID without verifying repository ownership and the Database function DeleteCommentByID performs no repository validation. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2691 | itsourcecode Event Management System manage_register.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2691</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in itsourcecode Event Management System 1.0.
