When parsing SVG images Dompdf performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are allowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not reference itself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself.

php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for `image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf, php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-referential `image` references, but a chained reference is not checked. A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or more SVG images.

When Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceeding the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple request to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request.

Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 21:13:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50248 | CKAN out of memory error when submitting the dataset form with a specially-crafted field</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50248</link><description>CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals.

Contracts containing large arrays might underallocate the number of slots they need by 1. Prior to v0.3.8, the calculation to determine how many slots a storage variable needed used `math.ceil(type_.size_in_bytes / 32)`. The intermediate floating point step can produce a rounding error if there are enough bits set in the IEEE-754 mantissa. Roughly speaking, if `type_.size_in_bytes` is large (&gt; 2**46), and slightly less than a power of 2, the calculation can overestimate how many slots are needed by 1. If `type_.size_in_bytes` is slightly more than a power of 2, the calculation can underestimate how many slots are needed by 1.

This means that the data to be written is instead replaced with whatever data had been in the packet buffer previously.  Thus, an unprivileged user with access to an affected system may abuse the bug to trigger disclosure of sensitive information.  In particular, the leak is limited to data previously stored in mbufs, which are used for network transmission and reception, and for certain types of inter-process communication.

The bug can also be triggered unintentionally by system applications, in which case the data written by the application to an NFS mount may be corrupted.  Corrupted data is written over the network to the NFS server, and thus also susceptible to being snooped by other hosts on the network.

Note that the bug exists only in the NFS client; the version and implementation of the server has no effect on whether a given system is affected by the problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:36:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-22942 | The vmwgfx driver contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22942</link><description>The vmwgfx driver contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other processes on the system through a dangling 'file' pointer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6534 | TCP spoofing vulnerability in pf(4)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6534</link><description>In versions of FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE before 14-RELEASE-p2, FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE before 13.2-RELEASE-p7 and FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE before 12.4-RELEASE-p9, the pf(4) packet filter incorrectly validates TCP sequence numbers.  This could allow a malicious actor to execute a denial-of-service attack against hosts behind the firewall.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45725 | Apache CouchDB, IBM Cloudant: Privilege Escalation Using _design Documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45725</link><description>Design document functions which receive a user http request object may expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who accesses the document.

These design document functions are:
  *    list
  *    show
  *    rewrite
  *    update

An attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with an "update" function.

For the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function from that design document.

Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request object's headers</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47536 | An improper access control vulnerability [CWE-284] in FortiOS version 7.2.0, version 7.0.13 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiPro...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47536</link><description>An improper access control vulnerability [CWE-284] in FortiOS version 7.2.0, version 7.0.13 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiProxy version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.9 and below, version 2.0.12 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the firewall deny geolocalisation policy via timing the bypass with a GeoIP database update.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46671 | Kibana Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46671</link><description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error.

In Nautobot 1.x and 2.0.x prior to 1.6.7 and 2.0.6, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...` and `/files/download/?name=...` are used to provide admin access to files that have been uploaded as part of a run request for a Job that has FileVar inputs. Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and are deleted once the Job in question runs. 

In the default implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances.

Note that no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering this a vulnerability.

Fixes are included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6. No known workarounds are available other than applying the patches included in those versions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 22:29:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5764 | Ansible: template injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5764</link><description>A template injection flaw was found in Ansible where a user's controller internal templating operations may remove the unsafe designation from template data.

When an AJP request is sent that exceeds the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 22:13:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50252 | php-svg-lib unsafe attributes merge when parsing `use` tag</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50252</link><description>php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library.

Prior to version 1.0.0-beta.13, the control of LAF app enV is not strict enough, and in certain scenarios of privatization environment, it may lead to sensitive information leakage in secret and configmap. In ES6 syntax, if an obj directly references another obj, the name of the obj itself will be used as the key, and the entire object structure will be integrated intact. When constructing the deployment instance of the app, env was found from the database and directly inserted into the template, resulting in controllability here. Sensitive information in the secret and configmap can be read through the k8s envFrom field. In a privatization environment, when `namespaceConf. fixed` is marked, it may lead to the leakage of sensitive information in the system. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether any patches or workarounds exist.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 20:45:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50251 | php-svg-lib possible DoS caused by infinite recursion when parsing SVG document</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50251</link><description>php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.1, when parsing the attributes passed to a `use` tag inside an svg document, an attacker can cause the system to go to an infinite recursion. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself. An attacker sending multiple request to a system to render the above payload can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 20:46:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50247 | h2o QUIC state exhaustion DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50247</link><description>h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The QUIC stack (quicly), as used by H2O up to commit 43f86e5 (in version 2.3.0-beta and prior), is susceptible to a state exhaustion attack. When H2O is serving HTTP/3, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to progressively increase the memory retained by the QUIC stack. This can eventually cause H2O to abort due to memory exhaustion. The vulnerability has been resolved in commit d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35. HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are not affected by this vulnerability as they do not use QUIC.

In version 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when h2o is configured to listen to multiple addresses or ports with each of them using different backend servers managed by multiple entities, a malicious backend entity that also has the opportunity to observe or inject packets exchanged between the client and h2o may misdirect HTTPS requests going to other backends and observe the contents of that HTTPS request being sent.

The attack involves a victim client trying to resume a TLS connection and an attacker redirecting the packets to a different address or port than that intended by the client. The attacker must already have been configured by the administrator of h2o to act as a backend to one of the addresses or ports that the h2o instance listens to. Session IDs and tickets generated by h2o are not bound to information specific to the server address, port, or the X.509 certificate, and therefore it is possible for an attacker to force the victim connection to wrongfully resume against a different server address or port on which the same h2o instance is listening.

Once a TLS session is misdirected to resume to a server address / port that is configured to use an attacker-controlled server as the backend, depending on the configuration, HTTPS requests from the victim client may be forwarded to the attacker's server.

An H2O instance is vulnerable to this attack only if the instance is configured to listen to different addresses or ports using the listen directive at the host level and the instance is configured to connect to backend servers managed by multiple entities.

A patch is available at commit 35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab. As a workaround, one may stop using using host-level listen directives in favor of global-level ones.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 19:52:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49279 | Umbraco CMS vulnerable to stored XSS via SVG File Upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49279</link><description>Umbraco is an ASP.NET content management system (CMS).

Both the overall correctness of the padding as well as the length of the encrypted message was leaking through timing side-channel. By sending large number of attacker-selected ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously intercepted PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example, to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA key exchange), or forge a signature using the victim's key. The issue was fixed by implementing the implicit rejection algorithm, in which the NSS returns a deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected, as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS &lt; 3.61.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 17:10:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26920 | fast-xml-parser before 4.1.2 allows __proto__ for Prototype Pollution.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26920</link><description>fast-xml-parser before 4.1.2 allows __proto__ for Prototype Pollution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 17:10:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-44543 | The femanager extension before 5.5.2, 6.x before 6.3.3, and 7.x before 7.0.1 for TYPO3 allows creation of frontend users in restricted group...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-44543</link><description>The femanager extension before 5.5.2, 6.x before 6.3.3, and 7.x before 7.0.1 for TYPO3 allows creation of frontend users in restricted groups (if there is a usergroup field on the registration form).

QUIC path validation (RFC 9000 Section 8.2) requires that the recipient of a PATH_CHALLENGE frame responds by sending a PATH_RESPONSE. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue. 
Quiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 13:35:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-12612 | An issue was discovered in BeyondTrust Privilege Management for Windows through 5.6.
