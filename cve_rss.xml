The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the `fund` function in `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function `getResourcesToSpend` without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the `txpool` / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the `txpool` and replaced with a new one.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 19:48:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33976 | TensorFlow segfault in array_ops.upper_bound</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33976</link><description>TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. `array_ops.upper_bound` causes a segfault when not given a rank 2 tensor.

s390/dasd: Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer

Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer in
dasd_eckd_dump_sense() that leads to a kernel panic in error cases.

When using indirect addressing for DASD CCWs (IDAW) the CCW CDA pointer
does not contain the data address itself but a pointer to the IDAL.
This needs to be translated from physical to virtual as well before
using it.

This dereferencing is also used for dasd_page_cache and also fixed
although it is very unlikely that this code path ever gets used.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42100 | clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don&amp;#x27;t call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh &gt;= 1&lt;&lt;32 (which is actually common - the
default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
div64_ul() in case we want to be safe &amp; cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
thresholds are larger than 1&lt;&lt;32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
possible overflow is just moot.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42103 | btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list during reclaim</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42103</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list during reclaim

There is a potential parallel list adding for retrying in
btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work and adding to the unused list. Since the block
group is removed from the reclaim list and it is on a relocation work,
it can be added into the unused list in parallel. When that happens,
adding it to the reclaim list will corrupt the list head and trigger
list corruption like below.

Fix it by taking fs_info-&gt;unused_bgs_lock.

There is a similar retry_list code in btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), but it is
safe, AFAICS. Since the block group was in the unused list, the used bytes
should be 0 when it was added to the unused list. Then, it checks
block_group-&gt;{used,reserved,pinned} are still 0 under the
block_group-&gt;lock. So, they should be still eligible for the unused list,
not the reclaim list.

The reason it is safe there it's because because we're holding
space_info-&gt;groups_sem in write mode.

That means no other task can allocate from the block group, so while we
are at deleted_unused_bgs() it's not possible for other tasks to
allocate and deallocate extents from the block group, so it can't be
added to the unused list or the reclaim list by anyone else.

The bug can be reproduced by btrfs/166 after a few rounds. In practice
this can be hit when relocation cannot find more chunk space and ends
with ENOSPC.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42104 | nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42104</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries

Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of
corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata
file inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file
gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),
tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).

The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers
of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are
read without checking.

Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as
errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer
analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42105 | nilfs2: fix inode number range checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix inode number range checks

Patch series "nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes".

This series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by
nilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted
filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting
number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is
intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  


This patch (of 3):

In the current implementation of nilfs2, "nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino", which
gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,
but its lower limit is not checked.

As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of
reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the
super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and
NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.

In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with
the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a
shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in
the C specification, so if "ns_first_ino" is set to a large value other
than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially
malfunction depending on the environment.

Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of "nilfs-&gt;ns_first_ino" and
by preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO
constant in the inode number test macros.

Also, change the type of "ns_first_ino" from signed integer to unsigned
integer to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the
lower bound check introduced this time.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42106 | inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42106</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for raw
sockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for the
underlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocol
field in struct inet_diag_req_raw.

inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req to
inet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issue
occurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.

Fix this by initializing the pad field in
inet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix in
inet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.

ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled

The ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and
result in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.

Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls
ptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already
released the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external
timestamp event occurs.

To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the
PTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42108 | net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42108</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Problem is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible
that the table-to-be-removed is still referenced by transactions being
processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally.

We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete
in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases.

AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with
commit e169285f8c56 ("netfilter: nf_tables: do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects"),
with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of
table-&gt;family which is whats triggering the above splat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42110 | net: ntb_netdev: Move ntb_netdev_rx_handler() to call netif_rx() from __netif_rx()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42110</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The cause is due to the idxd driver interrupt completion handler uses
threaded interrupt and the threaded handler is not hard or soft interrupt
context. However __netif_rx() can only be called from interrupt context.
Change the call to netif_rx() in order to allow completion via normal
context for dmaengine drivers that utilize threaded irq handling.

While the following commit changed from netif_rx() to __netif_rx(),
baebdf48c360 ("net: dev: Makes sure netif_rx() can be invoked in any context."),
the change should've been a noop instead. However, the code precedes this

And it also pinned it down to commit b5357cb268c4 ("btrfs: qgroup: do not
check qgroup inherit if qgroup is disabled").

[CAUSE]
That offending commit skips the whole qgroup inherit check if qgroup is
not enabled.

But that also skips the very basic checks like
num_ref_copies/num_excl_copies and the structure size checks.

Meaning if a qgroup enable/disable race is happening at the background,
and we pass a btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure when the qgroup is
disabled, the check would be completely skipped.

Then at the time of transaction commitment, qgroup is re-enabled and
btrfs_qgroup_inherit() is going to use the incorrect structure and
causing the above KASAN error.

[FIX]
Make btrfs_qgroup_check_inherit() only skip the source qgroup checks.
So that even if invalid btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure is passed in, we
can still reject invalid ones no matter if qgroup is enabled or not.

Furthermore we do already have an extra safety inside
btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), which would just ignore invalid qgroup sources,
so even if we only skip the qgroup source check we're still safe.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42112 | net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42112</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The parameter passed to kfree was 5a5a5a5a, which corresponds to the target field of
the jffs_inode_info structure. It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info
structure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these
variables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,
which is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the
function jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in
the function jffs2_init_inode_info.

The function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,
but in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,
which releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode
is not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked
may enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.

Since the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,
the fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42116 | igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42116</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev

During successful probe, igc logs this:

[    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHC added
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even before
register_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call works
on a partially uninitialized netdev.

Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right
after the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment,
just as in igb.

Now the log message is fine:

powerpc: Avoid nmi_enter/nmi_exit in real mode interrupt.

nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() touches per cpu variables which can lead to kernel
crash when invoked during real mode interrupt handling (e.g. early HMI/MCE
interrupt handler) if percpu allocation comes from vmalloc area.

Early HMI/MCE handlers are called through DEFINE_INTERRUPT_HANDLER_NMI()
wrapper which invokes nmi_enter/nmi_exit calls. We don't see any issue when
percpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with
CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu
allocation can come from the vmalloc area.

With kernel command line "percpu_alloc=page" we can force percpu allocation
to come from vmalloc area and can see kernel crash in machine_check_early:

drm/lima: fix shared irq handling on driver remove

lima uses a shared interrupt, so the interrupt handlers must be prepared
to be called at any time. At driver removal time, the clocks are
disabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end of
the remove process due to the devm usage.
This is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registers
which assumes clocks are enabled. A crash can be triggered by removing
the driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.
This patch frees the interrupts at each lima device finishing callback
so that the handlers are already unregistered by the time we fully
disable clocks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42128 | leds: an30259a: Use devm_mutex_init() for mutex initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic

The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty
limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications
fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,
possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so
large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For
dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty
limits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result to
exceed UINT_MAX.

This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator
sets dirty limits to &gt;16 TB.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42132 | bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42132</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot

Commit 272970be3dab ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix driver shutdown on closed

BT can't be enabled after below steps:
cold boot -&gt; enable BT -&gt; disable BT -&gt; warm reboot -&gt; BT enable failure
if property enable-gpios is not configured within DT|ACPI for QCA6390.

The commit is to fix a use-after-free issue within qca_serdev_shutdown()
by adding condition to avoid the serdev is flushed or wrote after closed
but also introduces this regression issue regarding above steps since the
VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot.

Fixed by sending the VSC to reset controller within qca_serdev_shutdown()
once BT was ever enabled, and the use-after-free issue is also fixed by
this change since the serdev is still opened before it is flushed or wrote.

net/mlx5: E-switch, Create ingress ACL when needed

Currently, ingress acl is used for three features. It is created only
when vport metadata match and prio tag are enabled. But active-backup
lag mode also uses it. It is independent of vport metadata match and
prio tag. And vport metadata match can be disabled using the
following devlink command:

 # devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name esw_port_metadata \
	value false cmode runtime

If ingress acl is not created, will hit panic when creating drop rule
for active-backup lag mode. If always create it, there will be about
5% performance degradation.

Fix it by creating ingress acl when needed. If esw_port_metadata is
true, ingress acl exists, then create drop rule using existing
ingress acl. If esw_port_metadata is false, create ingress acl and
then create drop rule.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42143 | orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42143</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List

The existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD
packets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.
As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate
of extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading
to potential list overflow.

To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After
considering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can
handle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry
timeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets
received beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed
out by the time they are handled by user-space.

Notably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like
timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42146 | drm/xe: Add outer runtime_pm protection to xe_live_ktest@xe_dma_buf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue

During the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop
the probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the
error branch will also release regs, in addition to its own
rollback operation.

As a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs
uninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to
the regs uninit process.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42148 | bnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42148</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds

Fix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical
cpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet
queues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues
module parameter.

Currently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array
"struct stats_query_entry query" present inside the "bnx2x_fw_stats_req"
struct in "drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h".
Looking at the definition of the "struct stats_query_entry query" array:

struct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+
         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];

FP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and
has a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3
meaning the array has a total size of 19.
Since accesses to "struct stats_query_entry query" are offset-ted by
BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet
queues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues
is reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set
to [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if
it is not.

This is also described in a comment in the source code in
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition
of FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important
for this patch

/*
  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is
  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the
  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default
  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can
  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such
  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like
  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues
  *
  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:
  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of
  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1
  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)
  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues
  *    is Y+1
  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for
  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional
  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).
  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE
  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.
  */

However this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can
handle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.
Looking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally
using the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 ("bnx2x: Add 57712 support").
Back then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver
was later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be
limited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the
array "stats_query_entry query" was still limited to using the FP-SB
available to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was
updated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being
aware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN
warnings seen in the stack traces below.

This patch increases the size of the "stats_query_entry query" array by
replacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle
both types of NICs.

fs: don't misleadingly warn during thaw operations

The block device may have been frozen before it was claimed by a
filesystem. Concurrently another process might try to mount that
frozen block device and has temporarily claimed the block device for
that purpose causing a concurrent fs_bdev_thaw() to end up here. The
mounter is already about to abort mounting because they still saw an
elevanted bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count so get_bdev_super() will return
NULL in that case.

For example, P1 calls dm_suspend() which calls into bdev_freeze() before
the block device has been claimed by the filesystem. This brings
bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count to 1 and no call into fs_bdev_freeze() is
required.

Now P2 tries to mount that frozen block device. It claims it and checks
bdev-&gt;bd_fsfreeze_count. As it's elevated it aborts mounting.

In the meantime P3 called dm_resume(). P3 sees that the block device is
already claimed by a filesystem and calls into fs_bdev_thaw().

P3 takes a passive reference and realizes that the filesystem isn't
ready yet. P3 puts itself to sleep to wait for the filesystem to become
ready.

P2 now puts the last active reference to the filesystem and marks it as
dying. P3 gets woken, sees that the filesystem is dying and
get_bdev_super() fails.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42150 | net: txgbe: remove separate irq request for MSI and INTx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42150</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishment

In nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq-&gt;ctrl early and if it is non-NULL we
know that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)
and we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl-&gt;sqs and sq-&gt;ctrl
(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.

However, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as
a result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with
the nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*
kill_and_confirm of sq-&gt;ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq
live reference). In this case, sq-&gt;ctrl was allocated however after it was
captured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.
This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.

Solve this by re-capturing the sq-&gt;ctrl after all inflight request has
completed, where for sure sq-&gt;ctrl reference is final, and move forward
based on that.

This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting
multiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl
leading up to this race window.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42153 | i2c: pnx: Fix potential deadlock warning from del_timer_sync() call in isr</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42153</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Avoid uninitialized value in BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD

[Changes from V1:
 - Use a default branch in the switch statement to initialize `val'.]

GCC warns that `val' may be used uninitialized in the
BPF_CRE_READ_BITFIELD macro, defined in bpf_core_read.h as:

	[...]
	unsigned long long val;						      \
	[...]								      \
	switch (__CORE_RELO(s, field, BYTE_SIZE)) {			      \
	case 1: val = *(const unsigned char *)p; break;			      \
	case 2: val = *(const unsigned short *)p; break;		      \

        }       							      \
	[...]
	val;								      \
	}								      \

This patch adds a default entry in the switch statement that sets
`val' to zero in order to avoid the warning, and random values to be
used in case __builtin_preserve_field_info returns unexpected values
for BPF_FIELD_BYTE_SIZE.

btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode

calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or
system) block groups, which can be allocated from unallocated disk
space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.

First, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate
one zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we
should use zone_size (= data_sinfo-&gt;chunk_size) as it is.

Second, the result "avail" may not be zone aligned. Since we always
allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size
aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim
process.

This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device.
Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and
end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:54:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7223 | SourceCodester Lot Reservation Management System view_model.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7223</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester Lot Reservation Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.

The
 “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the 
socket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX, 
such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or 
AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection 
between the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets 
back to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a 
connection race from a malicious local peer.

Platforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 22:10:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-7248 | Comodo Internet Security Pro Directory Traversal Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7248</link><description>Comodo Internet Security Pro Directory Traversal Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability.

x86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()

The 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling, which
isn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also ends
up making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarily
valid.

Basically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to the
caller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,
it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no serious
profiling is done using timers anyway these days.

And the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in the
simplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think when
the 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:

	Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy
	of eflags from PUSHF.

which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the
stack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just check
if they might be eflags or the return pc:

	Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses

but that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock
debugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stack
frame.

It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] and
others [2].

With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.

Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating to
this code from 2006:

  0cb91a229364 ("i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels")
  31679f38d886 ("Simplify profile_pc on x86-64")

and a code unification from 2009:

  ef4512882dbe ("x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc")

but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 17:49:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42097 | ALSA: emux: improve patch ioctl data validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: ecdh - explicitly zeroize private_key

private_key is overwritten with the key parameter passed in by the
caller (if present), or alternatively a newly generated private key.
However, it is possible that the caller provides a key (or the newly
generated key) which is shorter than the previous key. In that
scenario, some key material from the previous key would not be
overwritten. The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire
private_key array first.

Note that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:
previously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key would
remain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior is
consistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_valid
fails.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 17:49:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42091 | drm/xe: Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link

Commit e70b8dd26711 ("ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Remove afe-dai component
and rework codec link") removed the codec entry for the ETDM1_OUT_BE
dai link entirely instead of replacing it with COMP_EMPTY(). This worked
by accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codec
entry, and the platform entry became completely empty, effectively the
same as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai() doesn't do anything
for platform entries.

This causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in mtk_soundcard_common_probe()
in sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:

	for_each_card_prelinks(card, i, dai_link) {
		if (adsp_node &amp;&amp; !strncmp(dai_link-&gt;name, "AFE_SOF", strlen("AFE_SOF")))

		else if (!dai_link-&gt;platforms-&gt;name &amp;&amp; !dai_link-&gt;platforms-&gt;of_node)
			dai_link-&gt;platforms-&gt;of_node = platform_node;
	}

where the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least one entry.

Add an COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link-&gt;platforms has space.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:37:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42089 | ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv-&amp;gt;pdev before using it</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42089</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv-&gt;pdev to get access to the
dev struct, used with dev_err macros.
As priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer dereference.
Note that if priv-&gt;dev is dereferenced before assignment but never used,
for example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won't crash
probably due to compiler optimisations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:37:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42090 | pinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reproducer should be in the interpreter mode.

The C reproducer is trying to run the following bpf prog:

    0: (18) r0 = 0x0
    2: (18) r1 = map[id:49]
    4: (b7) r8 = 16777216

            ^^^^^^^^^^

    8: (b7) r3 = 8
    9: (b7) r4 = 0
   10: (85) call dev_map_lookup_elem#1543472
   11: (95) exit

It is due to the "void *key" (r2) passed to the helper. bpf allows uninit
stack memory access for bpf prog with the right privileges. This patch
uses kmsan_unpoison_memory() to mark the stack as initialized.

This should address different syzbot reports on the uninit "void *key"

If we're not in a NAPI softirq context, we need to be careful

call it with budget==0 to signal to it that we're not in a
safe context.

This was found while running some configuration stress testing

I found that ionic_tx_clean() calls napi_consume_skb() which calls
napi_skb_cache_put(), but before that last call is the note
    /* Zero budget indicate non-NAPI context called us, like netpoll */
and
    DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(!in_softirq());

Those are pretty big hints that we're doing it wrong.  We can pass a
context hint down through the calls to let ionic_tx_clean() know what
we're doing so it can call napi_consume_skb() correctly.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:18:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42072 | bpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset.

Zac's syzbot crafted a bpf prog that exposed two bugs in may_goto.
The 1st bug is the way may_goto is patched. When offset is negative
it should be patched differently.
The 2nd bug is in the verifier:
when current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth
it means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune
exploration of the program at this point.
Note, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,
since 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only
in the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state
will have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns
and the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:18:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42073 | mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Fix memory corruptions on Spectrum-4 systems</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42073</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Fix memory corruptions on Spectrum-4 systems

The following two shared buffer operations make use of the Shared Buffer
Status Register (SBSR):

 # devlink sb occupancy snapshot pci/0000:01:00.0
 # devlink sb occupancy clearmax pci/0000:01:00.0

The register has two masks of 256 bits to denote on which ingress /
egress ports the register should operate on. Spectrum-4 has more than
256 ports, so the register was extended by cited commit with a new
'port_page' field.

However, when filling the register's payload, the driver specifies the
ports as absolute numbers and not relative to the first port of the port
page, resulting in memory corruptions [1].

Fix by specifying the ports relative to the first port of the port page.

ocfs2: fix DIO failure due to insufficient transaction credits

The code in ocfs2_dio_end_io_write() estimates number of necessary
transaction credits using ocfs2_calc_extend_credits().  This however does
not take into account that the IO could be arbitrarily large and can
contain arbitrary number of extents.

Extent tree manipulations do often extend the current transaction but not
in all of the cases.  For example if we have only single block extents in
the tree, ocfs2_mark_extent_written() will end up calling
ocfs2_replace_extent_rec() all the time and we will never extend the
current transaction and eventually exhaust all the transaction credits if
the IO contains many single block extents.  Once that happens a
WARN_ON(jbd2_handle_buffer_credits(handle) &lt;= 0) is triggered in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() and subsequently OCFS2 aborts in response to
this error.  This was actually triggered by one of our customers on a
heavily fragmented OCFS2 filesystem.

To fix the issue make sure the transaction always has enough credits for
one extent insert before each call of ocfs2_mark_extent_written().

xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()

syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().

The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It
returns the error in two cases:

  1. memory allocation fails;
  2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params
     struct are not initialized properly.

The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params
struct with valid fields. So, warning is only triggered when there is a
problem with memory allocation.

Thus, there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be
safely removed.

ionic: fix kernel panic due to multi-buffer handling

Currently, the ionic_run_xdp() doesn't handle multi-buffer packets
properly for XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT.
When a jumbo frame is received, the ionic_run_xdp() first makes xdp
frame with all necessary pages in the rx descriptor.
And if the action is either XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it should unmap
dma-mapping and reset page pointer to NULL for all pages, not only the
first page.
But it doesn't for SG pages. So, SG pages unexpectedly will be reused.
It eventually causes kernel panic.

cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup

cxl_dpa_to_region() looks up a region based on a memdev and DPA.
It wrongly assumes an endpoint found mapping the DPA is also of
a fully assembled region. When not true it leads to a null pointer
dereference looking up the region name.

This appears during testing of region lookup after a failure to
assemble a BIOS defined region or if the lookup raced with the
assembly of the BIOS defined region.

Failure to clean up BIOS defined regions that fail assembly is an
issue in itself and a fix to that problem will alleviate some of
the impact. It will not alleviate the race condition so let's harden
this path.

The behavior change is that the kernel oops due to a null pointer
dereference is replaced with a dev_dbg() message noting that an
endpoint was mapped.

Additional comments are added so that future users of this function
can more clearly understand what it provides.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:55:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41085 | cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41085</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region
probe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.
The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a
pmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the
sequence so this dependency is met.

This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that
can be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not
yet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so
start the query from there instead.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:55:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41086 | bcachefs: Fix sb_field_downgrade validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41086</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: mcp251xfd: fix infinite loop when xmit fails

When the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails, the driver stops
processing messages, and the interrupt routine does not return,
running indefinitely even after killing the running application.

Error messages:
[  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16
[  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event FIFO buffer not empty. (seq=0x000017c7, tef_tail=0x000017cf, tef_head=0x000017d0, tx_head=0x000017d3).
... and repeat forever.

The issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPI
interface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.

The problem occurs because tx_ring-&gt;head increments even if
mcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently, the driver skips one TX
package while still expecting a response in
mcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().

Resolve the issue by starting a workqueue to write the tx obj
synchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error, decrement
tx_ring-&gt;head, remove skb from the echo stack, and drop the message.

In the past, there were similar failures reported by CI from other IGT
tests, observed on other platforms.

Before commit 63baf4f3d587 ("drm/i915/gt: Only wait for GPU activity
before unbinding a GGTT fence"), i915_vma_revoke_fence() was waiting for
idleness of vma-&gt;active via fence_update().   That commit introduced
vma-&gt;fence-&gt;active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait
selectively on that one instead of vma-&gt;active since only idleness of
fence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a
("drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal") replaced the call to
fence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and
also added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&amp;amp;fence-&gt;active)) in front.
No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of
vma-&gt;fence-&gt;active without first waiting on it.

The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence
registers on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked
on completion of a request that was using them on the other, still
processed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by
waiting for idleness of vma-&gt;fence-&gt;active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().

Additionally, DMA memory is assumed to by contiguous in physical
address space, which is not guaranteed by vmalloc().

Resolve this by checking the module flag drm_leak_fbdev_smem when
DRM allocated the instance of struct fb_info. Fbdev-dma then only
sets smem_start only if required (via FBINFO_HIDE_SMEM_START). Also
guarantee that the framebuffer is not located in vmalloc address
space.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:55:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41095 | drm/nouveau/dispnv04: fix null pointer dereference in nv17_tv_get_ld_modes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau/dispnv04: fix null pointer dereference in nv17_tv_get_ld_modes

In nv17_tv_get_ld_modes(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate() is
assigned to mode, which will lead to a possible NULL pointer dereference
on failure of drm_mode_duplicate().

Cure it by copying the descriptor and using the copy for the error exit path
unmask operation.

usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()

Syzbot is still reporting quite an old issue [1] that occurs due to
incomplete checking of present usb endpoints. As such, wrong
endpoints types may be used at urb sumbitting stage which in turn
triggers a warning in usb_submit_urb().

Fix the issue by verifying that required endpoint types are present
for both in and out endpoints, taking into account cmd endpoint type.

Unfortunately, this patch has not been tested on real hardware.

ata: libata-core: Fix null pointer dereference on error

If the ata_port_alloc() call in ata_host_alloc() fails,
ata_host_release() will get called.

However, the code in ata_host_release() tries to free ata_port struct
members unconditionally, which can lead to the following:

cachefiles_withdraw_objects().

This way, after setting FSCACHE_CACHE_IS_WITHDRAWN, only the following two
cases will occur:
1) fscache_begin_lookup fails in fscache_begin_volume_access().
2) fscache_withdraw_volume() will ensure that fscache_count_object() has

The fscache_volume in cache-&gt;volumes must not have been freed yet, but its
reference count may be 0. So use the new fscache_try_get_volume() helper
function try to get its reference count.

If the reference count of fscache_volume is 0, fscache_put_volume() is
freeing it, so wait for it to be removed from cache-&gt;volumes.

If its reference count is not 0, call cachefiles_withdraw_volume() with
reference count protection to avoid the above issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41059 | hfsplus: fix uninit-value in copy_name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41059</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bluetooth/l2cap: sync sock recv cb and release

The problem occurs between the system call to close the sock and hci_rx_work,
where the former releases the sock and the latter accesses it without lock protection.

           CPU0                       CPU1

If hci_rx_work processes the data that needs to be received before the sock is
closed, then everything is normal; Otherwise, the work thread may access the
released sock when receiving data.

Add a chan mutex in the rx callback of the sock to achieve synchronization between
the sock release and recv cb.

Sock is dead, so set chan data to NULL, avoid others use invalid sock pointer.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41063 | Bluetooth: hci_core: cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41063</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]-&gt;skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
    consumer_index ++;
Where variable data looks like this:
    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                               	consumer_index^
    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=, skb=, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41067 | btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41067</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly

[BUG]
When running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the
following ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():

	ASSERT(sector_nr &lt; stripe-&gt;nr_sectors);

Before that, we would have tree dump from
btrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for
the range.

[CAUSE]
Inside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new
bbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some
RST range covering the scrub target.

But if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,
while the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.

Then inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find
the sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is
submitted to lower layers).

And since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any
sector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe-&gt;nr_sectors,
triggering the ASSERT().

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call
btrfs_map_block() first.

Since our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update
stripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().

This new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio
completely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,
where if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the
scrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io
counter).

Although the root cause of RST lookup failure still needs to be
addressed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41068 | s390/sclp: Fix sclp_init() cleanup on failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41068</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()

Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().

It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing
fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be
closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and
then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.

Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in
kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent
the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.

With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which
triggers the race, KASAN detects the UAF:

Fix it by delaying the fdput() until `stt` is no longer in use, which
is effectively the entire function. To keep the patch minimal add a call
to fdput() at each of the existing return paths. Future work can convert
the function to goto or __cleanup style cleanup.

With the fix in place the test case no longer triggers the UAF.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41071 | wifi: mac80211: Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41071</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix quota root leak after quota disable failure

If during the quota disable we fail when cleaning the quota tree or when
deleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the 'out' label without
ever dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of the
root since fs_info-&gt;quota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we have
set it to NULL just before those steps).

Fix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the 'out' label.
This is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 by
commit bed92eae26cc ("Btrfs: qgroup implementation and prototypes"), but
back then we missed a kfree on the quota root and free_extent_buffer()
calls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were not
yet reference counted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41079 | nvmet: always initialize cqe.result</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41079</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()

The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),
which acquires the sqd-&gt;lock without releasing the uring_lock.
Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee ("io_uring: drop ctx-&gt;uring_lock
before acquiring sqd-&gt;lock"), this can lead to a potential deadlock
situation.

To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling
io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.

This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct
order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41081 | ila: block BH in ila_output()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41081</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fabrics: use reserved tag for reg read/write command

In some scenarios, if too many commands are issued by nvme command in
the same time by user tasks, this may exhaust all tags of admin_q. If
a reset (nvme reset or IO timeout) occurs before these commands finish,
reconnect routine may fail to update nvme regs due to insufficient tags,
which will cause kernel hang forever. In order to workaround this issue,
maybe we can let reg_read32()/reg_read64()/reg_write32() use reserved
tags. This maybe safe for nvmf:

1. For the disable ctrl path,  we will not issue connect command
2. For the enable ctrl / fw activate path, since connect and reg_xx()
   are called serially.

So the reserved tags may still be enough while reg_xx() use reserved tags.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41799 | tgstation-server&amp;#x27;s DreamMaker environment files outside the deployment directory can be compiled and ran by insufficiently permissioned users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41799</link><description>tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.8.0, low permission users using the "Set .dme Path" privilege could potentially set malicious .dme files existing on the host machine to be compiled and executed. These .dme files could be uploaded via tgstation-server (requiring a separate, isolated privilege) or some other means. A server configured to execute in BYOND's trusted security level (requiring a third separate, isolated privilege OR being set by another user) could lead to this escalating into remote code execution via BYOND's shell() proc. The ability to execute this kind of attack is a known side effect of having privileged TGS users, but normally requires multiple privileges with known weaknesses. This vector is not intentional as it does not require control over the where deployment code is sourced from and _may_ not require remote write access to an instance's `Configuration` directory. This problem is fixed in versions 6.8.0 and above.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 15:24:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41676 | Magento LTS vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in admin system configs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41676</link><description>Magento-lts is a long-term support alternative to Magento Community Edition (CE).

The issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments the task_struct

is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,
if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,
the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.

This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct
reference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:39:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41024 | misc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41024</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Syzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)
caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint
descriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of
the bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly
other routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for
distinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and
endpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug
identified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers
and directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).

To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress
when we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1
specs say these bits are "Reserved, reset to zero".)  This requires us
to make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and
use the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41036 | net: ks8851: Fix deadlock with the SPI chip variant</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41036</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers

Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available
firmware data buffer.

The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm
block header. This means the overall header length is variable, and the
position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string
fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow
the firmware data buffer.

As this ia bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change to
the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to
introduce new bugs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41039 | firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41039</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header

Fix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for the
wmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.

The original code tested that the firmware data buffer contained
enough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs

	wmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer

But wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 and
Halo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is
4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there
are enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with
wmfw_adsp2_sizes.

This patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each
of the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked
separately before they are used.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41040 | net/sched: Fix UAF when resolving a clash</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41040</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port().

syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux().

In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcount
of the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb-&gt;destructor, so we check
SOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU grace
period.

Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being put
into the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too early
in udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small race
window:

We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b ("net:
set SOCK_RCU_FREE before inserting socket into hashtable").

Let's apply the same fix for UDP.

netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate

nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will
result in a call stack overflow (ctx-&gt;level &gt;= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).

It also follows maps via -&gt;validate callback in nft_lookup, so there
appears no reason to iterate the maps again.

nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.
This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.

This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in
unbounded recursion:

with a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores.

I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from
nft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in
progress, so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.

For nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend
on table-&gt;validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier

bpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free

Currently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying
to cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as
well, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since
this relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock
situation as the previous patch.

It would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,
as the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once
async_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized
before it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to
arm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is
sufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return
HRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.

However, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer
before entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to
timer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback
running concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is
significantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration
happening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it
the struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.

Hence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after
async_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock
issues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the

i40e: Fix XDP program unloading while removing the driver

The commit 6533e558c650 ("i40e: Fix reset path while removing
the driver") introduced a new PF state "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" to block
modifying the XDP program while the driver is being removed.
Unfortunately, such a change is useful only if the ".ndo_bpf()"
callback was called out of the rmmod context because unloading the
existing XDP program is also a part of driver removing procedure.
In other words, from the rmmod context the driver is expected to
unload the XDP program without reporting any errors. Otherwise,
the kernel warning with callstack is printed out to dmesg.

Example failing scenario:
 1. Load the i40e driver.
 2. Load the XDP program.
 3. Unload the i40e driver (using "rmmod" command).

The example kernel warning log:

Fix this by checking if the XDP program is being loaded or unloaded.
Then, block only loading a new program while "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" is set.
Also, move testing "__I40E_IN_REMOVE" flag to the beginning of XDP_SETUP

This crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown
subtest in sockmap_basic.

This crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the
sk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the
architecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch
platform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform
for a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause
is that a zero length skb (skb-&gt;len == 0) was put on the queue.

This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),
invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():

	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);

In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no
page is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty
sge is queued into ingress_msg list.

And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by
sg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it
to kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.

To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),
if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking
copy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by
copy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41049 | filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode

Light Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in trace_posix_lock_inode().
The request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock entry
that was added to the inode's list. However, before the tracepoint could
fire, another task raced in and freed that lock.

Fix this by moving the tracepoint inside the spinlock, which should
ensure that this doesn't happen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41050 | cachefiles: cyclic allocation of msg_id to avoid reuse</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41050</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: cyclic allocation of msg_id to avoid reuse

Reusing the msg_id after a maliciously completed reopen request may cause
a read request to remain unprocessed and result in a hung, as shown below:

                                 // because ondemand_id &amp;&amp; fd is valid.

                // ondemand_object_worker() is done
                // but the object is still reopening.

                                // new open req_B

process_open_req
 copen 6,A.size
 // The expected failed copen was executed successfully

Expect copen to fail, and when it does, it closes fd, which sets the
object to close, and then close triggers reopen again. However, due to
msg_id reuse resulting in a successful copen, the anonymous fd is not
closed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopen
to complete may trigger hung task.

To avoid this issue, allocate the msg_id cyclically to avoid reusing the
msg_id for a very short duration of time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41051 | cachefiles: wait for ondemand_object_worker to finish when dropping object</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41051</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: wait for ondemand_object_worker to finish when dropping object

When queuing ondemand_object_worker() to re-open the object,
cachefiles_object is not pinned. The cachefiles_object may be freed when
the pending read request is completed intentionally and the related
erofs is umounted. If ondemand_object_worker() runs after the object is
freed, it will incur use-after-free problem as shown below.

process A  processs B  process C  process D

cachefiles_ondemand_send_req()
// send a read req X

           // close ondemand fd
           cachefiles_ondemand_fd_release()

cachefiles_put_object()

When dropping an object, it is no longer necessary to reopen the object,
so use cancel_work_sync() to cancel or wait for ondemand_object_worker()
to finish.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41052 | vfio/pci: Init the count variable in collecting hot-reset devices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41052</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit 5ec8e8ea8b77 ("mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing
memory_section-&gt;usage") changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE()
call around "ms-&gt;usage" to fix a race with section_deactivate() where
ms-&gt;usage can be cleared.  The READ_ONCE() call, by itself, is not enough
to prevent NULL pointer dereference.  We need to check its value before
dereferencing it.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:40:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37906 | Admidio has Blind SQL Injection in ecard_send.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37906</link><description>Admidio is a free, open source user management system for websites of organizations and groups. In Admidio before version 4.3.9, there is an SQL Injection in the `/adm_program/modules/ecards/ecard_send.php` source file of the Admidio Application. The SQL Injection results in a compromise of the application's database. The value of `ecard_recipients `POST parameter is being directly concatenated with the SQL query in the source code causing the SQL Injection. The SQL Injection can be exploited by a member user, using blind condition-based, time-based, and Out of band interaction SQL Injection payloads. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.3.9.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:29:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6984 | An issue was discovered in Juju that resulted in the leak of the sensitive context ID, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to access ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6984</link><description>An issue was discovered in Juju that resulted in the leak of the sensitive context ID, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to access other sensitive data or relation accessible to the local charm.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:29:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6576 | MOVEit Transfer Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6576</link><description>Improper Authentication vulnerability in Progress MOVEit Transfer (SFTP module) can lead to Privilege Escalation.This issue affects MOVEit Transfer: from 2023.0.0 before 2023.0.12, from 2023.1.0 before 2023.1.7, from 2024.0.0 before 2024.0.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:10:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41020 | filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41020</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()

There is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on
s390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in
do_exception().

However, since commit af19487f00f3 ("mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more
general"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with
PTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON
otherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().

Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar
to x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault
flags, for easier debugging.

Note that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot
support swap entries on other levels than PTE level.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 13:43:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41022 | drm/amdgpu: Fix signedness bug in sdma_v4_0_process_trap_irq()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41022</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block

This adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry
to make sure don't stray beyond valid memory region. Before patching, the
loop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the
range. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we
can change dup-&gt;length to dup-&gt;length-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the
next traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may
encounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.

In the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold
an unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and
xfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make
sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a
single-byte name before accessing xfs_dir2_data_entry.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41014 | xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41014</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data

There is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members
of xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.

We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by
following these steps:
    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records
    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate
       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and
       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter
       xlog_recover_process_data
    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2
    4) Make the end of the xlog_op_header entries only 1 byte away from
       xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_size
    5) xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_num_logops++
    6) Modify xlog_rec_header-&gt;h_crc

Fix:
Add a check to make sure there is sufficient space to access fixed members
of xlog_op_header.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 06:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41015 | ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_check_dir_entry()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41015</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
