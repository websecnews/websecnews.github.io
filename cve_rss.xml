comedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()

The comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation
`async-&gt;munge_chan %= async-&gt;cmd.chanlist_len` without first
checking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program submits a command with
chanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device
processes data in the interrupt handler path.

Add a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the
function, similar to the existing checks for !map and
CMDF_RAWDATA flag. When chanlist_len is zero, update
munge_count and return early, indicating the data was
handled without munging.

This prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:55:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12041 | ERI File Library &amp;lt;= 1.1.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Protected File Download</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12041</link><description>The ERI File Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'erifl_file' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0.

The utility uses Python's tarfile.extractall function without the filter="data" feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder. This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough.

drm/xe: Don't allow evicting of BOs in same VM in array of VM binds

An array of VM binds can potentially evict other buffer objects (BOs)
within the same VM under certain conditions, which may lead to NULL
pointer dereferences later in the bind pipeline. To prevent this, clear
the allow_res_evict flag in the xe_bo_validate call.

v2:
 - Invert polarity of no_res_evict (Thomas)
 - Add comment in code explaining issue (Thomas)

drm/sched: Fix potential double free in drm_sched_job_add_resv_dependencies

When adding dependencies with drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), that
function consumes the fence reference both on success and failure, so in
the latter case the dma_fence_put() on the error path (xarray failed to
expand) is a double free.

Interestingly this bug appears to have been present ever since
commit ebd5f74255b9 ("drm/sched: Add dependency tracking"), since the code
back then looked like this:

drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies():
...
       for (i = 0; i &lt; fence_count; i++) {
               ret = drm_sched_job_add_dependency(job, fences[i]);
               if (ret)
                       break;
       }

       for (; i &lt; fence_count; i++)
               dma_fence_put(fences[i]);

Which means for the failing 'i' the dma_fence_put was already a double
free. Possibly there were no users at that time, or the test cases were
insufficient to hit it.

The bug was then only noticed and fixed after
commit 9c2ba265352a ("drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies v2")
landed, with its fixup of
commit 4eaf02d6076c ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies").

At that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which
commit 963d0b356935 ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder")
noticed and attempted to fix.

But it only moved the double free from happening inside the
drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), when releasing the reference not yet
obtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference already released by
the former in the failure case.

As such it is not easy to identify the right target for the fixes tag so
lets keep it simple and just continue the chain.

While fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking
the reference and not dropping it.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40097 | ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40097</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function

The __component_match_add function may assign the 'matchptr' pointer
the value ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM), which will subsequently be dereferenced.

The call stack leading to the error looks like this:

hda_component_manager_init

        |-&gt; __component_match_add ( ... ,**matchptr, ... )

|-&gt; component_master_add_with_match( ...  match)

Add IS_ERR() check to prevent the crash.

btrfs: do not assert we found block group item when creating free space tree

Currently, when building a free space tree at populate_free_space_tree(),
if we are not using the block group tree feature, we always expect to find
block group items (either extent items or a block group item with key type
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY) when we search the extent tree with
btrfs_search_slot_for_read(), so we assert that we found an item. However
this expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in
the current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have
not added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do
not have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.

The insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree
happens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper
insert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction
handle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as
part of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation
if we are low on free space).

So remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block
group tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this
case.

btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data profile without an RST

At the end of btrfs_load_block_group_zone_info() the first thing we do
is to ensure that if the mapping type is not a SINGLE one and there is
no RAID stripe tree, then we return early with an error.

Doing that, though, prevents the code from running the last calls from
this function which are about freeing memory allocated during its
run. Hence, in this case, instead of returning early, we set the ret
value and fall through the rest of the cleanup code.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40102 | KVM: arm64: Prevent access to vCPU events before init</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40102</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Another day, another syzkaller bug. KVM erroneously allows userspace to
pend vCPU events for a vCPU that hasn't been initialized yet, leading to
KVM interpreting a bunch of uninitialized garbage for routing /
injecting the exception.

In one case the injection code and the hyp disagree on whether the vCPU
has a 32bit EL1 and put the vCPU into an illegal mode for AArch64,
tripping the BUG() in exception_target_el() during the next injection:

ixgbevf: fix mailbox API compatibility by negotiating supported features

There was backward compatibility in the terms of mailbox API. Various
drivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio
could easily negotiate mailbox API.

This convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.
Commit 0062e7cc955e ("ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code") added support
for IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the
rest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of
support was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such
code paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was
introduced along with introduction of the feature itself.

Commit 339f28964147 ("ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication
between PF and VF") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it
introduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API
version for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version
defined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,
as the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe
driver as it causes crashes.

The issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit
d0725312adf5 ("ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5").
As a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API
to version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.

To fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported
features. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec
and ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.

New mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API
revision, as API version of OOT PF &amp; VF drivers is already increased to
1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.

Features negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new
features when needed in the future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40105 | vfs: Don&amp;#x27;t leak disconnected dentries on umount</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40105</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfs: Don't leak disconnected dentries on umount

When user calls open_by_handle_at() on some inode that is not cached, we
will create disconnected dentry for it. If such dentry is a directory,
exportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the
dentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons
(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to
lookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we
are trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the
parent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the
parent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this
inconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point
to the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in
disconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until
commit f1ee616214cb ("VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon")
which removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb-&gt;s_anon list.
Thus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely
relies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.
However when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the
scenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries
are "leaked". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise
they stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous "Busy
inodes after unmount" bug. Make sure all dentries created under a
disconnected parent are marked as disconnected as well.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54469 | NeuVector Enforcer is vulnerable to Command Injection and Buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54469</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.


The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor
 process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks 
whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the 
monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.


The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT
 are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without 
validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user 
to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer
 container.</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 09:55:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54471 | NeuVector is shipping cryptographic material into its binary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54471</link><description>NeuVector used a hard-coded cryptographic key embedded in the source

When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server.


In affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS 
certificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster data to the
 telemetry server. As a result, the communication channel is susceptible
 to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept 
or modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the 
response of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size 
limitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS)
