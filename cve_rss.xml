The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '.../...//' (doubled triple dot slash) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. (CWE-35) 



 



Description 



 



Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Data Integration &amp; Analytics versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not sanitize a user input used as a file path through the CGG Draw API. 



 



Impact

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralize user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. (CWE-79) 



 



Description 



 



Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, allow a malicious URL to inject content into the Analyzer plugin interface. 



 



Impact 



 



Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 22:44:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24910 | Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24910</link><description>Overview 



 



XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents. (CWE-611) 



 



Description 



 



Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not correctly protect Pentaho Data Integration MessageSourceCrawler against out-of-band XML External Entity Reference. 



 



Impact 



 



By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 22:44:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24911 | Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24911</link><description>Overview

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control. (CWE-99) 



 



Description 



 



Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Data Integration &amp; Analytics versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not restrict JNDI identifiers during the creation of platform data sources. 



 



Impact

Prior to version 9.0.7, users can be sorted by their password hash. This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users. Although unlikely, if an attacker knows the hash value of their password, they can change the password and repeat the sorting until the other user's password hash is fully revealed. This issue is patched in version 9.0.7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:48:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32791 | Permission policy information leakage in Backstage permission system</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32791</link><description>The Backstage Scaffolder plugin houses types and utilities for building scaffolder-related modules. A vulnerability in the Backstage permission plugin backend allows callers to extract some information about the conditional decisions returned by the permission policy installed in the permission backend.

PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal

Before 456d8aa37d0f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to
avoid use-after-free"), we would free the ASPM link only after the last
function on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.

That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,
link-&gt;downstream would point to free'd memory after.

After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function
removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.

That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream
port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which
still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because
pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

On that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.
Free exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is
obsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.

jfs: add check read-only before truncation in jfs_truncate_nolock()

Added a check for "read-only" mode in the `jfs_truncate_nolock`
function to avoid errors related to writing to a read-only
filesystem.

Call stack:

block_write_begin() {
  jfs_write_failed() {
    jfs_truncate() {
      jfs_truncate_nolock() {
        txEnd() {
          ...
          log = JFS_SBI(tblk-&gt;sb)-&gt;log;
          // (log == NULL)

If the `isReadOnly(ip)` condition is triggered in
`jfs_truncate_nolock`, the function execution will stop, and no
further data modification will occur. Instead, the `xtTruncate`
function will be called with the "COMMIT_WMAP" flag, preventing
modifications in "read-only" mode.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:31:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58095 | jfs: add check read-only before txBeginAnon() call</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: add srng-&gt;lock for ath11k_hal_srng_* in monitor mode

ath11k_hal_srng_* should be used with srng-&gt;lock to protect srng data.

For ath11k_dp_rx_mon_dest_process() and ath11k_dp_full_mon_process_rx(),
they use ath11k_hal_srng_* for many times but never call srng-&gt;lock.

So when running (full) monitor mode, warning will occur:
RIP: 0010:ath11k_hal_srng_dst_peek+0x18/0x30 [ath11k]
Call Trace:
 ? ath11k_hal_srng_dst_peek+0x18/0x30 [ath11k]

So add srng-&gt;lock for them to avoid such warnings.

Inorder to fetch the srng-&gt;lock, should change srng's definition from
'void' to 'struct hal_srng'. And initialize them elsewhere to prevent
one line of code from being too long. This is consistent with other ring
process functions, such as ath11k_dp_process_rx().

wifi: ath11k: fix RCU stall while reaping monitor destination ring

While processing the monitor destination ring, MSDUs are reaped from the
link descriptor based on the corresponding buf_id.

However, sometimes the driver cannot obtain a valid buffer corresponding
to the buf_id received from the hardware. This causes an infinite loop
in the destination processing, resulting in a kernel crash.

kernel log:
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data msdu_pop: invalid buf_id 309
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data msdu_pop: invalid buf_id 309
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed

Fix this by skipping the problematic buf_id and reaping the next entry,

nfsd_nl_listener_set_doit() would manipulate the list of transports of
server's sv_permsocks and close the specified listener but the other
list of transports (server's sp_xprts list) would not be changed leading
to the problem above.

Instead, determined if the nfsdctl is trying to remove a listener, in
which case, delete all the existing listener transports and re-create
all-but-the-removed ones.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:31:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22025 | nfsd: put dl_stid if fail to queue dl_recall</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22025</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: put dl_stid if fail to queue dl_recall

Before calling nfsd4_run_cb to queue dl_recall to the callback_wq, we
increment the reference count of dl_stid.
We expect that after the corresponding work_struct is processed, the
reference count of dl_stid will be decremented through the callback
function nfsd4_cb_recall_release.
However, if the call to nfsd4_run_cb fails, the incremented reference
count of dl_stid will not be decremented correspondingly, leading to the
following nfs4_stid leak:

nfsd: don't ignore the return code of svc_proc_register()

Currently, nfsd_proc_stat_init() ignores the return value of
svc_proc_register(). If the procfile creation fails, then the kernel
will WARN when it tries to remove the entry later.

Fix nfsd_proc_stat_init() to return the same type of pointer as
svc_proc_register(), and fix up nfsd_net_init() to check that and fail
the nfsd_net construction if it occurs.

svc_proc_register() can fail if the dentry can't be allocated, or if an
identical dentry already exists. The second case is pretty unlikely in
the nfsd_net construction codepath, so if this happens, return -ENOMEM.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:31:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22027 | media: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22027</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callback

Syzkaller has reported a general protection fault at function
ir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointer
dereference of dev-&gt;raw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL in
the same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs due
to the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function:
rc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev-&gt;raw
pointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only
after that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.

If rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler is
not finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thus
rc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:31:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22028 | media: vimc: skip .s_stream() for stopped entities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22028</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: fix crypto_free_acomp() deadlock in zswap_cpu_comp_dead()

Currently, zswap_cpu_comp_dead() calls crypto_free_acomp() while holding
the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.  crypto_free_acomp() then holds scomp_lock
(through crypto_exit_scomp_ops_async()).

On the other hand, crypto_alloc_acomp_node() holds the scomp_lock (through
crypto_scomp_init_tfm()), and then allocates memory.  If the allocation
results in reclaim, we may attempt to hold the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.

The above dependencies can cause an ABBA deadlock.  For example in the
following scenario:

(1) Task A running on CPU #1:
    crypto_alloc_acomp_node()
      Holds scomp_lock
      Enters reclaim
      Reads per_cpu_ptr(pool-&gt;acomp_ctx, 1)

(2) Task A is descheduled

(3) CPU #1 goes offline
    zswap_cpu_comp_dead(CPU #1)
      Holds per_cpu_ptr(pool-&gt;acomp_ctx, 1))
      Calls crypto_free_acomp()
      Waits for scomp_lock

(4) Task A running on CPU #2:
      Waits for per_cpu_ptr(pool-&gt;acomp_ctx, 1) // Read on CPU #1
      DEADLOCK

Since there is no requirement to call crypto_free_acomp() with the per-CPU
acomp_ctx mutex held in zswap_cpu_comp_dead(), move it after the mutex is
unlocked.  Also move the acomp_request_free() and kfree() calls for
consistency and to avoid any potential sublte locking dependencies in the
future.

With this, only setting acomp_ctx fields to NULL occurs with the mutex
held.  This is similar to how zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() only initializes
acomp_ctx fields with the mutex held, after performing all allocations
before holding the mutex.

Opportunistically, move the NULL check on acomp_ctx so that it takes place
before the mutex dereference.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22031 | PCI/bwctrl: Fix NULL pointer dereference on bus number exhaustion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22031</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/bwctrl: Fix NULL pointer dereference on bus number exhaustion

When BIOS neglects to assign bus numbers to PCI bridges, the kernel
attempts to correct that during PCI device enumeration.  If it runs out
of bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the "subordinate" pointer in
the bridge's pci_dev remains NULL.

The PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL
subordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.

Bandwidth control of unusable devices below the bridge is of questionable
utility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe hotplug does
since commit 62e4492c3063 ("PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp
probe").

The PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of
bus numbers.  PCIe hotplug emits an additional message with KERN_ERR
severity to inform the user that hotplug functionality is disabled at the
bridge.  A similar message for bandwidth control does not seem merited,
given that its only purpose so far is to expose an up-to-date link speed
in sysfs and throttle the link speed on certain laptops with limited
Thermal Design Power.  So error out silently.

User-visible messages:

do_alignment_t32_to_handler() only fixes up alignment faults for

that's the case, signal to the caller that it needs to proceed with the
regular alignment fault handling (i.e. SIGBUS). Without this patch, the

mm/gup: reject FOLL_SPLIT_PMD with hugetlb VMAs

Patch series "mm: fixes for device-exclusive entries (hmm)", v2.

Discussing the PageTail() call in make_device_exclusive_range() with
Willy, I recently discovered [1] that device-exclusive handling does not
properly work with THP, making the hmm-tests selftests fail if THPs are
enabled on the system.

Looking into more details, I found that hugetlb is not properly fenced,
and I realized that something that was bugging me for longer -- how
device-exclusive entries interact with mapcounts -- completely breaks
migration/swapout/split/hwpoison handling of these folios while they have
device-exclusive PTEs.

The program below can be used to allocate 1 GiB worth of pages and making
them device-exclusive on a kernel with CONFIG_TEST_HMM.

Once they are device-exclusive, these folios cannot get swapped out
(proc$pid/smaps_rollup will always indicate 1 GiB RSS no matter how much
one forces memory reclaim), and when having a memory block onlined to
ZONE_MOVABLE, trying to offline it will loop forever and complain about
failed migration of a page that should be movable.

# echo offline &gt; /sys/devices/system/memory/memory136/state
# echo online_movable &gt; /sys/devices/system/memory/memory136/state
# ./hmm-swap &amp;

This series fixes all issues I found so far.  There is no easy way to fix
without a bigger rework/cleanup.  I have a bunch of cleanups on top (some
previous sent, some the result of the discussion in v1) that I will send
out separately once this landed and I get to it.

I wish we could just use some special present PROT_NONE PTEs instead of
these (non-present, non-none) fake-swap entries; but that just results in
the same problem we keep having (lack of spare PTE bits), and staring at
other similar fake-swap entries, that ship has sailed.

With this series, make_device_exclusive() doesn't actually belong into
mm/rmap.c anymore, but I'll leave moving that for another day.

I only tested this series with the hmm-tests selftests due to lack of HW,
so I'd appreciate some testing, especially if the interaction between two
GPUs wanting a device-exclusive entry works as expected.

tracing: Fix use-after-free in print_graph_function_flags during tracer switching

Kairui reported a UAF issue in print_graph_function_flags() during
ftrace stress testing [1]. This issue can be reproduced if puting a
'mdelay(10)' after 'mutex_unlock(&amp;amp;trace_types_lock)' in s_start(),
and executing the following script:

  $ echo function_graph &gt; current_tracer
  $ cat trace &gt; /dev/null &amp;
  $ sleep 5  # Ensure the 'cat' reaches the 'mdelay(10)' point
  $ echo timerlat &gt; current_tracer

The root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags
within print_trace_line during each s_show():

  * One through 'iter-&gt;trace-&gt;print_line()';
  * Another through 'event-&gt;funcs-&gt;trace()', which is hidden in
    print_trace_fmt() before print_trace_line returns.

Tracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues
to use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script
above is print_graph_function_flags.

Moreover, when switching from the 'function_graph' tracer to the
'timerlat' tracer, s_start only calls graph_trace_close of the
'function_graph' tracer to free 'iter-&gt;private', but does not set
it to NULL. This provides an opportunity for 'event-&gt;funcs-&gt;trace()'
to use an invalid 'iter-&gt;private'.

To fix this issue, set 'iter-&gt;private' to NULL immediately after
freeing it in graph_trace_close(), ensuring that an invalid pointer
is not passed to other tracers. Additionally, clean up the unnecessary
'iter-&gt;private = NULL' during each 'cat trace' when using wakeup and
irqsoff tracers.

exfat: fix random stack corruption after get_block

When get_block is called with a buffer_head allocated on the stack, such

the following race condition situation.

  * stack corruption here *

This patch returns -EAGAIN if a folio does not have buffers when bh_read
needs to be called. By doing this, the caller can fallback to functions
like block_read_full_folio(), create a buffer_head in the folio, and then
call get_block again.

Let's do not call bh_read() with on-stack buffer_head.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22037 | ksmbd: fix null pointer dereference in alloc_preauth_hash()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22037</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acpi: nfit: fix narrowing conversion in acpi_nfit_ctl

Syzkaller has reported a warning in to_nfit_bus_uuid(): "only secondary
bus families can be translated". This warning is emited if the argument
is equal to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_NFIT == 0. Function acpi_nfit_ctl() first
verifies that a user-provided value call_pkg-&gt;nd_family of type u64 is
not equal to 0. Then the value is converted to int, and only after that
is compared to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_MAX. This can lead to passing an invalid
argument to acpi_nfit_ctl(), if call_pkg-&gt;nd_family is non-zero, while
the lower 32 bits are zero.

Furthermore, it is best to return EINVAL immediately upon seeing the
invalid user input.  The WARNING is insufficient to prevent further
undefined behavior based on other invalid user input.

All checks of the input value should be applied to the original variable
call_pkg-&gt;nd_family.

x86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range() when used for zapping normal PMDs

On the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for zapping normal
PMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE
entries in the pointed-to page table:

    collapse_pte_mapped_thp
      pmdp_collapse_flush
        flush_tlb_range

The arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can
be used for page table removal, and does not use any last-level
invalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by making it behave the
same way.

Currently, X86 only uses this information for the following two purposes,
which I think means the issue doesn't have much impact:

 - In native_flush_tlb_multi() for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be
   IPI'd to avoid issues with speculative page table walks.
 - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.

The patch "x86/mm: only invalidate final translations with INVLPGB" which
is currently under review (see
)
would probably be making the impact of this a lot worse.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22046 | uprobes/x86: Harden uretprobe syscall trampoline check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22046</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The verifier test `calls: div by 0 in subprog` triggers a panic at the
ld.bu instruction. The ld.bu insn is trying to load byte from memory
address returned by the subprog. The subprog actually set the correct
address at the a5 register (dedicated register for BPF return values).
But at commit 73c359d1d356 ("LoongArch: BPF: Sign-extend return values")
we also sign extended a5 to the a0 register (return value in LoongArch).
For function call insn, we later propagate the a0 register back to a5
register. This is right for native calls but wrong for bpf2bpf calls
which expect zero-extended return value in a5 register. So only move a0
to a5 for native calls (i.e. non-BPF_PSEUDO_CALL).</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22049 | LoongArch: Increase ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN up to 16</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22049</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Increase ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN up to 16

ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is 1 by default, but some LoongArch-specific devices
(such as APBDMA) require 16 bytes alignment. When the data buffer length
is too small, the hardware may make an error writing cacheline. Thus, it
is dangerous to allocate a small memory buffer for DMA. It's always safe

usbnet:fix NPE during rx_complete

Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path.
The usb_submit_urb function lacks a usbnet_going_away
validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check.

This inconsistency creates a race condition where:
A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding SKB data
fails to be queued.

Subsequent processes:
(e.g., rx_complete → defer_bh → __skb_unlink(skb, list))
attempt to access skb-&gt;next, triggering a NULL pointer

net: ibmveth: make veth_pool_store stop hanging

v2:
- Created a single error handling unlock and exit in veth_pool_store
- Greatly expanded commit message with previous explanatory-only text

Summary: Use rtnl_mutex to synchronize veth_pool_store with itself,
ibmveth_close and ibmveth_open, preventing multiple calls in a row to
napi_disable.

Background: Two (or more) threads could call veth_pool_store through
writing to /sys/devices/vio/30000002/pool*/*. You can do this easily
with a little shell script. This causes a hang.

I configured LOCKDEP, compiled ibmveth.c with DEBUG, and built a new
kernel. I ran this test again and saw:

net: fix geneve_opt length integer overflow

struct geneve_opt uses 5 bit length for each single option, which
means every vary size option should be smaller than 128 bytes.

However, all current related Netlink policies cannot promise this
length condition and the attacker can exploit a exact 128-byte size
option to *fake* a zero length option and confuse the parsing logic,
further achieve heap out-of-bounds read.

One example crash log is like below:

netfilter: nft_tunnel: fix geneve_opt type confusion addition

When handling multiple NFTA_TUNNEL_KEY_OPTS_GENEVE attributes, the
parsing logic should place every geneve_opt structure one by one
compactly. Hence, when deciding the next geneve_opt position, the
pointer addition should be in units of char *.

However, the current implementation erroneously does type conversion
before the addition, which will lead to heap out-of-bounds write.

Upstream fix ac888d58869b ("net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in

dst_release to avoid accessing already freed data in case of netns
dismantle. However in case CONFIG_DST_CACHE is enabled and OvS+tunnels
are used, this fix is incomplete as the same issue will be seen for
cached dsts:

udp: Fix memory accounting leak.

Matt Dowling reported a weird UDP memory usage issue.

Under normal operation, the UDP memory usage reported in /proc/net/sockstat
remains close to zero.  However, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages
and never dropped.  Moreover, the value doubled when the application was
terminated.  Finally, it caused intermittent packet drops.

We can reproduce the issue with the script below [0]:

  1. /proc/net/sockstat reports 0 pages

    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 1 mem 0

  2. Run the script till the report reaches 524,288

  5. The number doubles

    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 1 mem 1048577

The application set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUF, which triggered an integer
overflow in udp_rmem_release().

When a socket is close()d, udp_destruct_common() purges its receive
queue and sums up skb-&gt;truesize in the queue.  This total is calculated
and stored in a local unsigned integer variable.

The total size is then passed to udp_rmem_release() to adjust memory
accounting.  However, because the function takes a signed integer
argument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow.

Then, the released amount is calculated as follows:

  1) Add size to sk-&gt;sk_forward_alloc.
  2) Round down sk-&gt;sk_forward_alloc to the nearest lower multiple of
      PAGE_SIZE and assign it to amount.
  3) Subtract amount from sk-&gt;sk_forward_alloc.
  4) Pass amount &gt;&gt; PAGE_SHIFT to __sk_mem_reduce_allocated().

When the issue occurred, the total in udp_destruct_common() was 2147484480
(INT_MAX + 833), which was cast to -2147482816 in udp_rmem_release().

At 1) sk-&gt;sk_forward_alloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and
2) sets -2147479552 to amount.  3) reverts the wraparound, so we don't
see a warning in inet_sock_destruct().  However, udp_memory_allocated
ends up doubling at 4).

Since commit 3cd3399dd7a8 ("net: implement per-cpu reserves for
memory_allocated"), memory usage no longer doubles immediately after
a socket is close()d because __sk_mem_reduce_allocated() caches the
amount in udp_memory_per_cpu_fw_alloc.  However, the next time a UDP
socket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing UDP
memory usage to double.

This issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's
sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc exceeds net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min, resulting in packet
drops.

To prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and
call sk_forward_alloc_add() only once for the small delta.

Note that first_packet_length() also potentially has the same problem.

udp: Fix multiple wraparounds of sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc.

__udp_enqueue_schedule_skb() has the following condition:

  if (atomic_read(&amp;amp;sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc) &gt; sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf)
          goto drop;

sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf is initialised by net.core.rmem_default and later can
be configured by SO_RCVBUF, which is limited by net.core.rmem_max,
or SO_RCVBUFFORCE.

If we set INT_MAX to sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf, the condition is always false
as sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc is also signed int.

Then, the size of the incoming skb is added to sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc
unconditionally.

This results in integer overflow (possibly multiple times) on
sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc and allows a single socket to have skb up to
net.core.udp_mem[1].

For example, if we set a large value to udp_mem[1] and INT_MAX to
sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf and flood packets to the socket, we can see multiple
overflows:

  # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
  UDP: inuse 3 mem 7956736  &lt;-- (7956736 &lt;&lt; 12) bytes &gt; INT_MAX * 15
                                             ^- PAGE_SHIFT
  # ss -uam
  State  Recv-Q      ...
  UNCONN -1757018048 ...    &lt;-- flipping the sign repeatedly
         skmem:(r2537949248,rb2147483646,t0,tb212992,f1984,w0,o0,bl0,d0)

Previously, we had a boundary check for INT_MAX, which was removed by
commit 6a1f12dd85a8 ("udp: relax atomic operation on sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc").

A complete fix would be to revert it and cap the right operand by
INT_MAX:

  rmem = atomic_add_return(size, &amp;amp;sk-&gt;sk_rmem_alloc);
  if (rmem &gt; min(size + (unsigned int)sk-&gt;sk_rcvbuf, INT_MAX))
          goto uncharge_drop;

but we do not want to add the expensive atomic_add_return() back just
for the corner case.

Casting rmem to unsigned int prevents multiple wraparounds, but we still
allow a single wraparound.

  # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
  UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  &lt;-- (INT_MAX + 1) &gt;&gt; 12

  # ss -uam
  State  Recv-Q      ...
  UNCONN -2147482816 ...   &lt;-- INT_MAX + 831 bytes
         skmem:(r2147484480,rb2147483646,t0,tb212992,f3264,w0,o0,bl0,d14468947)

So, let's define rmem and rcvbuf as unsigned int and check skb-&gt;truesize
only when rcvbuf is large enough to lower the overflow possibility.

Note that we still have a small chance to see overflow if multiple skbs
to the same socket are processed on different core at the same time and
each size does not exceed the limit but the total size does.

Note also that we must ignore skb-&gt;truesize for a small buffer as
explained in commit 363dc73acacb ("udp: be less conservative with
sock rmem accounting").</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22060 | net: mvpp2: Prevent parser TCAM memory corruption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22060</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mvpp2: Prevent parser TCAM memory corruption

Protect the parser TCAM/SRAM memory, and the cached (shadow) SRAM
information, from concurrent modifications.

Both the TCAM and SRAM tables are indirectly accessed by configuring
an index register that selects the row to read or write to. This means
that operations must be atomic in order to, e.g., avoid spreading
writes across multiple rows. Since the shadow SRAM array is used to
find free rows in the hardware table, it must also be protected in
order to avoid TOCTOU errors where multiple cores allocate the same
row.

This issue was detected in a situation where `mvpp2_set_rx_mode()` ran
concurrently on two CPUs. In this particular case the
MVPP2_PE_MAC_UC_PROMISCUOUS entry was corrupted, causing the
classifier unit to drop all incoming unicast - indicated by the
`rx_classifier_drops` counter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22061 | net: airoha: Fix qid report in airoha_tc_get_htb_get_leaf_queue()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22061</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlabel: Fix NULL pointer exception caused by CALIPSO on IPv4 sockets

When calling netlbl_conn_setattr(), addr-&gt;sa_family is used
to determine the function behavior. If sk is an IPv4 socket,
but the connect function is called with an IPv6 address,
the function calipso_sock_setattr() is triggered.
Inside this function, the following code is executed:

sk_fullsock(__sk) ? inet_sk(__sk)-&gt;pinet6 : NULL;

Since sk is an IPv4 socket, pinet6 is NULL, leading to a
null pointer dereference.

This patch fixes the issue by checking if inet6_sk(sk)

fs/9p: fix NULL pointer dereference on mkdir

When a 9p tree was mounted with option 'posixacl', parent directory had a
default ACL set for its subdirectories, e.g.:

  setfacl -m default:group:simpsons:rwx parentdir

then creating a subdirectory crashed 9p client, as v9fs_fid_add() call in
function v9fs_vfs_mkdir_dotl() sets the passed 'fid' pointer to NULL
(since dafbe689736) even though the subsequent v9fs_set_create_acl() call
expects a valid non-NULL 'fid' pointer:

spufs: fix gang directory lifetimes

prior to "[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks" we used to have
a problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns opened
gang directory, which normally gets removed when that gets closed,
but if somebody has created a context belonging to that gang and
kept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and we
ended up with a leak.

Unfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gang
directory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.
One problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()
as cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was
in the success case - gang creation incremented link count on
root directory, but that was no longer undone when gang got
destroyed.

Fix consists of
	* reverting the commit in question
	* adding a counter to gang, protected by -&gt;i_rwsem
of gang directory inode.
	* having it set to 1 at creation time, dropped
in both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumped
in spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0.
	* using simple_recursive_removal() to take the gang
directory out when counter reaches zero.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22073 | spufs: fix a leak on spufs_new_file() failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22073</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfstests generic/730 test failed because after deleting the device

smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance causing leaks and use-after-free

Commit ef7134c7fc48 ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network
namespace.") attempted to fix a netns use-after-free issue by manually
adjusting reference counts via sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt and sock_inuse_add().

However, a later commit e9f2517a3e18 ("smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock
after rmmod") pointed out that the approach of manually setting
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt in the first commit was technically incorrect, as
sk-&gt;sk_net_refcnt should only be set for user sockets. It led to issues
like TCP timers not being cleared properly on close. The second commit
moved to a model of just holding an extra netns reference for
server-&gt;ssocket using get_net(), and dropping it when the server is torn
down.

But there remain some gaps in the get_net()/put_net() balancing added by
these commits. The incomplete reference handling in these fixes results
in two issues:

1. Netns refcount leaks[1]

The problem process is as follows:

```
mount.cifs                        cifsd

cifs_do_mount
  cifs_mount
    cifs_mount_get_session
      cifs_get_tcp_session

            get_net()
            -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
            put_net()
          generic_ip_connect /* Try port 139 */
            get_net() /* Missing matching put_net() for this get_net().*/
      cifs_get_smb_ses
        cifs_negotiate_protocol
          smb2_negotiate
            SMB2_negotiate
              cifs_send_recv
                wait_for_response
                                 cifs_demultiplex_thread
                                   cifs_read_from_socket
                                     cifs_readv_from_socket
                                       cifs_reconnect
                                         cifs_abort_connection
                                           sock_release();
                                           server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
                                           /* Missing put_net() here. */
                                           generic_ip_connect
                                             get_net()
                                             -&gt;connect() /* Failed */
                                             put_net()
                                             sock_release();
                                             server-&gt;ssocket = NULL;
          free_rsp_buf
    ...
                                   clean_demultiplex_info
                                     /* It's only called once here. */
                                     put_net()
```

When cifs_reconnect() is triggered, the server-&gt;ssocket is released
without a corresponding put_net() for the reference acquired in
generic_ip_connect() before. it ends up calling generic_ip_connect()
again to retry get_net(). After that, server-&gt;ssocket is set to NULL
in the error path of generic_ip_connect(), and the net count cannot be
released in the final clean_demultiplex_info() function.

2. Potential use-after-free

The current refcounting scheme can lead to a potential use-after-free issue
in the following scenario:

```
 cifs_do_mount
   cifs_mount
     cifs_mount_get_session
       cifs_get_tcp_session
         get_net()  /* First get net */
           ip_connect
             generic_ip_connect
               get_net()
               bind_socket
	         kernel_bind /* failed */
               put_net()
         /* after out_err_crypto_release label */
         put_net()
         /* after out_err label */
         put_net()
```

In the exception handling process where binding the socket fails, the

vhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint

If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a
vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs
found by Haoran Zhang:

1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:

This fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is
called more than once and calls after the first call do not find any
tpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds
tpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:

vhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);
...

kfree(vs-&gt;vs_tpg);
vs-&gt;vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found
match=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the
pointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:

kfree(vs-&gt;vs_tpg);
vs-&gt;vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

If a scsi request is then sent we do:

vhost_scsi_handle_vq -&gt; vhost_scsi_get_req -&gt; vhost_vq_get_backend

which sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.

2. Tpg dir removal hang:

This patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer
tpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount
dropping to -1.

The problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already
in the vs-&gt;vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so
target_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do
target_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their
refcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added
in the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in
previous calls which are also in vs-&gt;vs_tpg.

Later, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do
target_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs-&gt;vs_tpg which will drop
their refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg
and will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.

3. Tpg leak:

This fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be
un-removable because the target name is overwritten when
vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different
target names.

The bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup
a vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls
VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we
haven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this
happens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite
the target name and the vs-&gt;vs_tpg array. Later when we do
vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's
name and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the
vs-&gt;vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing
target_undepend_item on the tpgs.

Because of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call
vhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major
user, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the
issues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called
if it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the
tpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint
first.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22084 | w1: fix NULL pointer dereference in probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22084</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

w1: fix NULL pointer dereference in probe

The w1_uart_probe() function calls w1_uart_serdev_open() (which includes
devm_serdev_device_open()) before setting the client ops via
serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer
dereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler, as it assumes
serdev-&gt;ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
w1_uart_serdev_open().</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22085 | RDMA/core: Fix use-after-free when rename device name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22085</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix mlx5_poll_one() cur_qp update flow

When cur_qp isn't NULL, in order to avoid fetching the QP from
the radix tree again we check if the next cqe QP is identical to
the one we already have.

The bug however is that we are checking if the QP is identical by
checking the QP number inside the CQE against the QP number inside the
mlx5_ib_qp, but that's wrong since the QP number from the CQE is from
FW so it should be matched against mlx5_core_qp which is our FW QP
number.

Otherwise we could use the wrong QP when handling a CQE which could
cause the kernel trace below.

This issue is mainly noticeable over QPs 0 &amp; 1, since for now they are
the only QPs in our driver whereas the QP number inside mlx5_ib_qp
doesn't match the QP number inside mlx5_core_qp.

1. If a BPF program is rewritten, re-evaluate the stack size. For non-JIT

2. For non-JIT cases, calculating interpreters[idx] may still cause

The problem can be reproduced using the following steps:
  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  cat /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters/*

The panic occurs because of casting the device pointer into an
ib_device pointer using container_of() in hw_stat_device_show() is
wrong and leads to a memory corruption.

However the real problem is that hw counters should never been exposed
outside of the non-init net namespace.

Fix this by saving the index of the corresponding attribute group
(it might be 1 or 2 depending on the presence of driver-specific
attributes) and zeroing the pointer to hw_counters group for compat
devices during the initialization.

With this fix applied hw_counters are not available in a non-init
net namespace:
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/1/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/2/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters

  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22090 | x86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22090</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()

If track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple
tree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over
the dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied
any page tables.

Consequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the
PAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page
table was not copied.

The easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA
if track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about "simply"
clearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()
and performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll
simply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...
which is also wrong.

So let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation
succeeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if
anything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT
flag after undoing the reservation.

Note that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will
get removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set
then, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be
happy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation
is not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.

A reproducer can trigger this usually at the first try:

Likely this case was missed in:

... and instead of undoing the reservation we simply cleared the VM_PAT flag.

Keep the documentation of these functions in include/linux/pgtable.h,
one place is more than sufficient -- we should clean that up for the other
functions like track_pfn_remap/untrack_pfn separately.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22091 | RDMA/mlx5: Fix page_size variable overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix page_size variable overflow

Change all variables storing mlx5_umem_mkc_find_best_pgsz() result to
unsigned long to support values larger than 31 and avoid overflow.

For example: If we try to register 4GB of memory that is contiguous in
physical memory, the driver will optimize the page_size and try to use
an mkey with 4GB entity size. The 'unsigned int' page_size variable will
overflow to '0' and we'll hit the WARN_ON() in alloc_cacheable_mr().

PCI: Fix NULL dereference in SR-IOV VF creation error path

Clean up when virtfn setup fails to prevent NULL pointer dereference
during device removal. The kernel oops below occurred due to incorrect
error handling flow when pci_setup_device() fails.

Add pci_iov_scan_device(), which handles virtfn allocation and setup and
cleans up if pci_setup_device() fails, so pci_iov_add_virtfn() doesn't need
to call pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device().  This prevents accessing
partially initialized virtfn devices during removal.

drm/amd/display: avoid NPD when ASIC does not support DMUB

ctx-&gt;dmub_srv will de NULL if the ASIC does not support DMUB, which is
tested in dm_dmub_sw_init.

However, it will be dereferenced in dmub_hw_lock_mgr_cmd if
should_use_dmub_lock returns true.

This has been the case since dmub support has been added for PSR1.

Fix this by checking for dmub_srv in should_use_dmub_lock.

Commit 176cda0619b6 ("powerpc/perf: Add perf interface to expose vpa
counters") introduced 'vpa_pmu' to expose Book3s-HV nested APIv2 provided
L1&lt;-&gt;L2 context switch latency counters to L1 user-space via
perf-events. However the newly introduced PMU named 'vpa_pmu' doesn't
assign ownership of the PMU to the module 'vpa_pmu'. Consequently the
module 'vpa_pmu' can be unloaded while one of the perf-events are still
active, which can lead to kernel oops and panic of the form below on a
Pseries-LPAR:

BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000058

 Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!

Fix this by adding the module ownership to 'vpa_pmu' so that the module
'vpa_pmu' is ref-counted and prevented from being unloaded when perf-events
are initialized.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22095 | PCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22095</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()

If the regulator_bulk_get() returns an error and no regulators
are created, we need to set their number to zero.

If we don't do this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the
regulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel panic.

While at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error
upwards as the kernel will WARN() on an error from add_bus().

Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix kernel panic during FW release

This fixes a kernel panic seen during release FW in a stress test
scenario where WLAN and BT FW download occurs simultaneously, and due to
a HW bug, chip sends out only 1 bootloader signatures.

When driver receives the bootloader signature, it enters FW download
mode, but since no consequtive bootloader signatures seen, FW file is
not requested.

After 60 seconds, when FW download times out, release_firmware causes a
kernel panic.

ibmvnic: Use kernel helpers for hex dumps

Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer was cast
to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer
size was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.

Therefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and
calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.

bonding: check xdp prog when set bond mode

Following operations can trigger a warning[1]:

    ip netns add ns1

    ip netns del ns1

When delete the namespace, dev_xdp_uninstall() is called to remove xdp
program on bond dev, and bond_xdp_set() will check the bond mode. If bond
mode is changed after attaching xdp program, the warning may occur.

Some bond modes (broadcast, etc.) do not support native xdp. Set bond mode
with xdp program attached is not good. Add check for xdp program when set
bond mode.

There are actually 2 problems:
- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
  element is out of bounds.

The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
element is part of an unmapped page.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22108 | bnxt_en: Mask the bd_cnt field in the TX BD properly</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22108</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

will be properly masked and set to 0 in the bd_cnd field.

Without this patch, the out-of-range bd_cnt value will corrupt the
TX BD and may cause TX timeout.

The next patch will check for values exceeding 32.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22109 | ax25: Remove broken autobind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22109</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: Remove broken autobind

Binding AX25 socket by using the autobind feature leads to memory leaks
in ax25_connect() and also refcount leaks in ax25_release(). Memory
leak was detected with kmemleak:

When socket is bound, refcounts must be incremented the way it is done
in ax25_bind() and ax25_setsockopt() (SO_BINDTODEVICE). In case of
autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.

This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:

Considering the issues above and the comments left in the code that say:
"check if we can remove this feature. It is broken."; "autobinding in this
may or may not work"; - it is better to completely remove this feature than
to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs.

Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an
error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature
might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with
this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it
is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for
popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25.

by nfqnl_get_sk_secctx().

This patch corrects this problem by initializing the lsmctx to a safe

net: Remove RTNL dance for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

SIOCBRDELIF is passed to dev_ioctl() first and later forwarded to
br_ioctl_call(), which causes unnecessary RTNL dance and the splat
below [0] under RTNL pressure.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and
Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.

In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by
netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call()
also re-acquires RTNL.

In the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove
the bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL
and wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.

Thread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),
which may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by
Thread B.

To avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call
dev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:

  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()
  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()
  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()
  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()

3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move
1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().

Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better
performed before RTNL.

SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since
the pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process
them there.

ext4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroying

Presently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal marked
with JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp running
stress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is
possible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is
destroyed eg:

(umount)
ext4_kill_sb
  kill_block_super
    generic_shutdown_super
      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */
      evict_inodes
        /* might start a new txn */
      ext4_put_super
	flush_work(&amp;amp;sbi-&gt;s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */
        jbd2_journal_destroy
          journal_kill_thread
            journal-&gt;j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;
          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction
            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer
              jbd2_journal_bmap
                ext4_journal_bmap
                  ext4_map_blocks
                    ...
                    ext4_inode_error
                      ext4_handle_error
                        schedule_work(&amp;amp;sbi-&gt;s_sb_upd_work)

                                               /* work queue kicks in */
                                               update_super_work
                                                 jbd2_journal_start
                                                   start_this_handle
                                                     BUG_ON(journal-&gt;j_flags &amp;
                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)

Hence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do
a journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just
fallback to an un-journaled commit.

Further, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:

  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying
  2. force a commit and wait for it
  3. flush pending sb updates

This sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb
update that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the
journal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)

Also, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only
called from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22114 | btrfs: don&amp;#x27;t clobber ret in btrfs_validate_super()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22114</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit 2a9bb78cfd36 ("btrfs: validate system chunk array at

btrfs: fix block group refcount race in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()

Block group creation is done in two phases, which results in a slightly
unintuitive property: a block group can be allocated/deallocated from
after btrfs_make_block_group() adds it to the space_info with
btrfs_add_bg_to_space_info(), but before creation is completely completed
in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(). As a result, it is possible for a
block group to go unused and have 'btrfs_mark_bg_unused' called on it
concurrently with 'btrfs_create_pending_block_groups'. This causes a
number of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag
'BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW'.

However, this fix is not quite complete. Since it does not use the
unused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:

btrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused
                                           if list_empty // false
        list_del_init
        clear_bit
                                           else if (test_bit) // true
                                                list_move_tail

And we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs
state for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to
prevent.

The broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:

Commit 8b10d3653735 ("f2fs: introduce FAULT_NO_SEGMENT") allows to trigger
no free segment fault in allocator, then it will update curseg-&gt;segno to
NULL_SEGNO, though, CP_ERROR_FLAG has been set, f2fs_write_inode() missed
to check the flag, and access invalid curseg-&gt;segno directly in below call
path, then resulting in panic:

 - f2fs_is_checkpoint_ready

    - __get_secs_required
     - has_curseg_enough_space
      - get_ckpt_valid_blocks
      : access invalid curseg-&gt;segno

To avoid this issue, let's:
- check CP_ERROR_FLAG flag in prior to f2fs_is_checkpoint_ready() in
f2fs_write_inode().
- in has_curseg_enough_space(), save curseg-&gt;segno into a temp variable,
and verify its validation before use.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22124 | md/md-bitmap: fix wrong bitmap_limit for clustermd when write sb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22124</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/md-bitmap: fix wrong bitmap_limit for clustermd when write sb

In clustermd, separate write-intent-bitmaps are used for each cluster
node:

0                    4k                     8k                    12k
-------------------------------------------------------------------

| bm bits[0, contd]   | bm super[1] + bits  | bm bits[1, contd]   |
| bm super[2] + bits  | bm bits [2, contd]  | bm super[3] + bits  |
| bm bits [3, contd]  |                     |                     |

So in node 1, pg_index in __write_sb_page() could equal to
bitmap-&gt;storage.file_pages. Then bitmap_limit will be calculated to
0. md_super_write() will be called with 0 size.
That means the first 4k sb area of node 1 will never be updated
through filemap_write_page().
This bug causes hang of mdadm/clustermd_tests/01r1_Grow_resize.

Here use (pg_index % bitmap-&gt;storage.file_pages) to make calculation
of bitmap_limit correct.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22125 | md/raid1,raid10: don&amp;#x27;t ignore IO flags</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22125</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags

If blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performance
is quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,
due to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since
blk-wbt is introduced.

Other than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for
example REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority
reverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because
io will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.

Fix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.

md: fix mddev uaf while iterating all_mddevs list

While iterating all_mddevs list from md_notify_reboot() and md_exit(),
list_for_each_entry_safe is used, and this can race with deletint the
next mddev, causing UAF:

t1:
spin_lock
//list_for_each_entry_safe(mddev, n, ...)
 mddev_get(mddev1)
 // assume mddev2 is the next entry
 spin_unlock
            t2:
            //remove mddev2
            ...
            mddev_free

            kfree(mddev2)
 mddev_put(mddev1)
 spin_lock
 //continue dereference mddev2-&gt;all_mddevs

The old helper for_each_mddev() actually grab the reference of mddev2
while holding the lock, to prevent from being freed. This problem can be
fixed the same way, however, the code will be complex.

Hence switch to use list_for_each_entry, in this case mddev_put() can free
the mddev1 and it's not safe as well. Refer to md_seq_show(), also factor
out a helper mddev_put_locked() to fix this problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22127 | f2fs: fix potential deadloop in prepare_compress_overwrite()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22127</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix potential deadloop in prepare_compress_overwrite()

Jan Prusakowski reported a kernel hang issue as below:

When running xfstests on linux-next kernel (6.14.0-rc3, 6.12) I
encountered a problem in generic/475 test where fsstress process
gets blocked in __f2fs_write_data_pages() and the test hangs.
The options I used are:

The root cause is: once generic/475 starts toload error table to dm
device, f2fs_prepare_compress_overwrite() will loop reading compressed
cluster pages due to IO error, meanwhile it has held .writepages lock,
it can block all other writeback tasks.

Let's fix this issue w/ below changes:
- add f2fs_handle_page_eio() in prepare_compress_overwrite() to
detect IO error.
- detect cp_error earler in f2fs_read_multi_pages().</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22128 | wifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22128</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path

If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the
IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in
ath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless one of the functions
requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.

This may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the
affinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:

kernel/irq/manage.c:

	/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc-&gt;affinity_hint))
		desc-&gt;affinity_hint = NULL;

So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling
ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once
again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does
no harm.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23129 | wifi: ath11k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in error path</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23129</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The warning is due to not clearing the affinity hint before freeing the
IRQs.

So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling
ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once
again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does
no harm.

dlm: prevent NPD when writing a positive value to event_done

do_uevent returns the value written to event_done. In case it is a
positive value, new_lockspace would undo all the work, and lockspace
would not be set. __dlm_new_lockspace, however, would treat that
positive value as a success due to commit 8511a2728ab8 ("dlm: fix use
count with multiple joins").

Down the line, device_create_lockspace would pass that NULL lockspace to
dlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Treating such positive values as successes prevents the problem. Given
this has been broken for so long, this is unlikely to break userspace
expectations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23132 | f2fs: quota: fix to avoid warning in dquot_writeback_dquots()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23132</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If checkpoint comes from mount/umount/remount/freeze/quotactl, caller of
checkpoint has already held s_umount lock, calling dquot_writeback_dquots()
in the context should be safe.

So let's record task to sbi-&gt;umount_lock_holder, so that checkpoint can
know whether the lock has held in the context or not by checking current
w/ it.

In addition, in order to not misrepresent caller of checkpoint, we should
not allow to trigger async checkpoint for those callers: mount/umount/remount/
freeze/quotactl.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23133 | wifi: ath11k: update channel list in reg notifier instead reg worker</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23133</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: update channel list in reg notifier instead reg worker

Currently when ath11k gets a new channel list, it will be processed
according to the following steps:
1. update new channel list to cfg80211 and queue reg_work.
2. cfg80211 handles new channel list during reg_work.
3. update cfg80211's handled channel list to firmware by
ath11k_reg_update_chan_list().

But ath11k will immediately execute step 3 after reg_work is just
queued. Since step 2 is asynchronous, cfg80211 may not have completed
handling the new channel list, which may leading to an out-of-bounds
write error:
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ath11k_reg_update_chan_list
Call Trace:

Should ensure step 2 is completely done before executing step 3. Thus
Wen raised patch[1]. When flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER is set,
cfg80211 will notify ath11k after step 2 is done.

So enable the flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER then cfg80211 will
notify ath11k after step 2 is done. At this time, there will be no
KASAN bug during the execution of the step 3.

ALSA: timer: Don't take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user()

The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often
problematic when it's called inside another mutex, as they might lead
to deadlocks.

In the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with
guard(mutex)(&amp;amp;register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- which
was mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had been
carefully worked around in the past.

This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() out
of the register mutex lock again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23135 | RISC-V: KVM: Teardown riscv specific bits after kvm_exit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23135</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: int340x: Add NULL check for adev

Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL.
This is similar to the commit cd2fd6eab480
("platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL").

Add a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to
avoid a possible NULL pointer deref in int3402_thermal_probe().

Note, under the same directory, int3400_thermal_probe() has such a
check.

watch_queue: fix pipe accounting mismatch

Currently, watch_queue_set_size() modifies the pipe buffers charged to
user-&gt;pipe_bufs without updating the pipe-&gt;nr_accounted on the pipe
itself, due to the if (!pipe_has_watch_queue()) test in
pipe_resize_ring(). This means that when the pipe is ultimately freed,
we decrement user-&gt;pipe_bufs by something other than what than we had
charged to it, potentially leading to an underflow. This in turn can
cause subsequent too_many_pipe_buffers_soft() tests to fail with -EPERM.

To remedy this, explicitly account for the pipe usage in
watch_queue_set_size() to match the number set via account_pipe_buffers()

(It's unclear why watch_queue_set_size() does not update nr_accounted;
it may be due to intentional overprovisioning in watch_queue_set_size()?)</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:32:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3693 | Tenda W12 httpd cgiWifiRadioSet stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3693</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda W12 3.0.0.5.

netfilter: socket: Lookup orig tuple for IPv6 SNAT

nf_sk_lookup_slow_v4 does the conntrack lookup for IPv4 packets to
restore the original 5-tuple in case of SNAT, to be able to find the
right socket (if any). Then socket_match() can correctly check whether
the socket was transparent.

However, the IPv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this
conntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the
packet was SNATed. Add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.

IPv6 SNAT is used in Kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as
pods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ULA subnet and need to be replaced
with the node's external address. Cilium leverages Envoy to enforce L7
policies, and Envoy uses transparent sockets. Cilium inserts an iptables
prerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects
the packets to localhost, but it fails to match SNATed IPv6 packets due
to that missing conntrack lookup.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:41:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22022 | usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22022</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop
bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed
Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was
received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:

[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0

[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]

It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in
page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

It's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending TDs on other endpoints (either IN or OUT),
other devices or even other HCs in the same IOMMU domain.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it
caused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk
was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to
starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial "PCIe splitter" board.

Fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if
it's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports
tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining
Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

usb: xhci: Don't skip on Stopped - Length Invalid

Up until commit d56b0b2ab142 ("usb: xhci: ensure skipped isoc TDs are
returned when isoc ring is stopped") in v6.11, the driver didn't skip
missed isochronous TDs when handling Stoppend and Stopped - Length
Invalid events. Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which
would cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the
missed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.

This buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged
since the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first
and foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but
by the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.

After d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those
Stopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -
Length Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already
given back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized
as matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and
will result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly
before they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.

As a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this
kind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside
of not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is
that if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated
to account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.

I had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there
is no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be
a very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch
is that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting
a cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.

This will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB
pointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely
to be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:41:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30960 | WordPress FS Poster plugin &amp;lt;= 6.5.8 - Subscriber+ Site Wide Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30960</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in NotFound FS Poster.

holding_time are NULL. Because there is only for the situation
where entry is NULL and holding_time exists, it can be passed
when both entry and holding_time are NULL. If these are NULL,
the entry will be passd to eg_cache_put() as parameter and
it is referenced by entry-&gt;use code in it.

In versions starting from 2.2.0 but prior to 2.10.27 and 2.11.1, the management of JetStream assets happens with messages in the $JS. subject namespace in the system account; this is partially exposed into regular accounts to allow account holders to manage their assets. Some of the JS API requests were missing access controls, allowing any user with JS management permissions in any account to perform certain administrative actions on any JS asset in any other account. At least one of the unprotected APIs allows for data destruction. None of the affected APIs allow disclosing stream contents. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.11.1 or v2.10.27.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:31:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32385 | EspoCRM allows unrestricted Embedding in Iframe dashlet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32385</link><description>EspoCRM is an Open Source Customer Relationship Management software. Prior to 9.0.5, Iframe dashlet allows user to display iframes with arbitrary URLs. As the sandbox attribute is not included in the iframe, the remote page can open popups outside of the iframe, potentially tricking users and creating a phishing risk. The iframe URL is user-defined, so an attacker would need to trick the user into specifying a malicious URL. The missing sandbox attribute also allows the remote page to send messages to the parent frame. However, EspoCRM does not make use of these messages.

The confirmation flow for account creation currently uses a GET request triggered by clicking a link sent via email. Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers) may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed by the victim’s email client. This does not allow attackers to take over or access existing accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 22:18:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27929 | Growatt Cloud portal Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27929</link><description>Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve full list of users associated with arbitrary accounts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 22:18:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22263 | WordPress Global Gallery plugin &amp;lt;= 8.8.0 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22263</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in NotFound Global Gallery allows Reflected XSS.

In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a race condition vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:59:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32923 | WordPress Tourmaster plugin &amp;lt; 5.4.1 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32923</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in NotFound Tourmaster allows Reflected XSS.

open source self hosted media server. Versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable to argument injection in FFmpeg. This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos//stream and /Videos//stream., likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work. This vulnerability is patched in version 10.10.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:44:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32021 | Weblate VCS credentials included in URL parameters are potentially logged and saved into browser history as plaintext</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32021</link><description>Weblate is a web based localization tool. Prior to version 5.11, when creating a new component from an existing component that has a source code repository URL specified in settings, this URL is included in the client's URL parameters during the creation process. If, for example, the source code repository URL contains GitHub credentials, the confidential PAT and username are shown in plaintext and get saved into browser history. Moreover, if the request URL is logged, the credentials are written to logs in plaintext. If using Weblate official Docker image, nginx logs the URL and the token in plaintext. This issue is patched in version 5.11.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:44:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21573 | No english

A command injection vulnerability exists in the screenshot API of the Web Check project (Lissy93/web-check). The issue stems from user-controlled input (url) being passed unsanitized into a shell command using exec(), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying host. This could be exploited by sending crafted url parameters to extract files or even establish remote access. The vulnerability has been patched by replacing exec() with execFile(), which avoids using a shell and properly isolates arguments.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:32:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31497 | TEIGarage XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in Document Conversion Service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31497</link><description>TEIGarage is a webservice and RESTful service to transform, convert and validate various formats, focussing on the TEI format. The Document Conversion Service contains a critical XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in its document conversion functionality. The service processes XML files during the conversion process but fails to disable external entity processing, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This vulnerability could allow attackers to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information. Additionally, depending on the server configuration, this could potentially be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by making the server connect to internal services. This issue is patched in version 1.2.4. A workaround for this vulnerability includes disabling external entity processing in the XML parser by setting the appropriate security features (e.g., XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING).</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:13:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32012 | Jellyfin Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via IP Spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32012</link><description>Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. In versions 10.9.0 to before 10.10.7, the /System/Restart endpoint provides administrators the ability to restart their Jellyfin server. This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:13:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2567 | Lantronix Xport Missing Authentication for Critical Function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2567</link><description>An attacker could modify or disable settings, disrupt fuel monitoring

In versions before 0.16.0, these scripts were spawned without proper process cleanup, leaving zombie processes in the system's process table. Even during normal usage, every track change and playback event would leave behind zombie processes. This leads to inevitable resource exhaustion over time as the system's process table fills up, eventually preventing new processes from being created. The issue is exacerbated if events occur rapidly, whether through normal use (e.g., skipping through a playlist) or potential manipulation of the Deezer Connect protocol traffic. This issue has been fixed in version 0.16.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:35:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30206 | Dpanel&amp;#x27;s hard-coded JWT secret leads to remote code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30206</link><description>Dpanel is a Docker visualization panel system which provides complete Docker management functions. The Dpanel service contains a hardcoded JWT secret in its default configuration, allowing attackers to generate valid JWT tokens and compromise the host machine. This security flaw allows attackers to analyze the source code, discover the embedded secret, and craft legitimate JWT tokens. By forging these tokens, an attacker can successfully bypass authentication mechanisms, impersonate privileged users, and gain unauthorized administrative access. Consequently, this enables full control over the host machine, potentially leading to severe consequences such as sensitive data exposure, unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation, or further lateral movement within the network environment. This issue is patched in version 1.6.1. A workaround for this vulnerability involves replacing the hardcoded secret with a securely generated value and load it from secure configuration storage.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:26:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32445 | Users can gain privileged access to the host system and cluster with EventSource and Sensor CR</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32445</link><description>Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. A user with permission to create/modify EventSource and Sensor custom resources can gain privileged access to the host system and cluster, even without having direct administrative privileges. The EventSource and Sensor CRs allow the corresponding orchestrated pod to be customized with spec.template and spec.template.container (with type k8s.io/api/core/v1.Container), thus, any specification under container such as command, args, securityContext , volumeMount can be specified, and applied to the EventSource or Sensor pod. With these, a user would be able to gain privileged access to the cluster host, if he/she specified the EventSource/Sensor CR with some particular properties under template. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.9.6.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:26:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27791 | Collabora Online Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27791</link><description>Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. In versions prior to 24.04.12.4, 23.05.19, and 22.05.25, there is a path traversal flaw in handling the CheckFileInfo BaseFileName field returned from WOPI servers. This allows for a file to be written anywhere the uid running Collabora Online can write, if such a response was supplied by a malicious WOPI server. By combining this flaw with a Time of Check, Time of Use DNS lookup issue with a WOPI server address under attacker control, it is possible to present such a response to be processed by a Collabora Online instance. This issue has been patched in versions 24.04.13.1, 23.05.19, and 22.05.25.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:16:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22903 | TOTOLINK N600R V4.3.0cu.7647_B20210106 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the pin parameter in the function setWiFiWpsConfig.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22903</link><description>TOTOLINK N600R V4.3.0cu.7647_B20210106 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the pin parameter in the function setWiFiWpsConfig.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25456 | Tenda AC10 V4.0si_V16.03.10.20 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in AdvSetMacMtuWan via mac2.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25456</link><description>Tenda AC10 V4.0si_V16.03.10.20 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in AdvSetMacMtuWan via mac2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:16:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22900 | Totolink N600R v4.3.0cu.7647_B20210106 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the macCloneMac parameter in the setWanConfig function...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22900</link><description>Totolink N600R v4.3.0cu.7647_B20210106 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the macCloneMac parameter in the setWanConfig function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:00:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24358 | gorilla/csrf CSRF vulnerability due to broken Referer validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24358</link><description>gorilla/csrf provides Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention middleware for Go web applications &amp; services.

Its executes its validation of the Referer header for cross-origin requests only when it believes the request is being served over TLS. It determines this by inspecting the r.URL.Scheme value. However, this value is never populated for "server" requests per the Go spec, and so this check does not run in practice. This vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained XSS on a subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level domain.

If user import is enabled (which is the default setting), any registered user can upload an archive for importing. The code uses the yauzl library for reading the archive. The yauzl library does not contain any mechanism to detect or prevent extraction of a  Zip Bomb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb . Therefore, when using the User Import functionality with a Zip Bomb, PeerTube will try extracting the archive which will cause a disk space resource exhaustion.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:09:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28145 | Edimax AC1200 Wave 2 Dual-Band Gigabit Router BR-6478AC V3 1.0.15 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via partition ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28145</link><description>Edimax AC1200 Wave 2 Dual-Band Gigabit Router BR-6478AC V3 1.0.15 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via partition in /boafrm/formDiskFormat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:09:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32948 | PeerTube ActivityPub Playlist Creation Blind SSRF and DoS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32948</link><description>The vulnerability allows any attacker to cause the PeerTube server to stop functioning, or in special cases send requests to arbitrary URLs (Blind SSRF).
