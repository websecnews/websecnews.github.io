Currently, no concrete attack on the algorithm is known. However, prospective users of HQC must take extra care when using the algorithm in protocols involving key derivation. In particular, HQC does not provide the same security guarantees as Kyber or ML-KEM. There is currently no patch for the HQC flaw available in liboqs, so HQC is disabled by default in liboqs starting from version 0.13.0.

When handling a crash, the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`, which detects if the crashing process resided in a container, was being called before `consistency_checks`, which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this, if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one, apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container, potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally, given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone, crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd, or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e., if dump mode == 1).</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 17:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5357 | FreeFloat FTP Server PWD Command buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5357</link><description>A vulnerability was found in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0.

read access to the resulting core dump</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4598</link><description>A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.

A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:38:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1484 | A vulnerability exists in the media upload component of the Asset

If a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide current working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for the new thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already running. 

This may lead to unintended operations such as loading code or accessing files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to exploit.

Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 06:46:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48485 | FreeScout Vulnerable to Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48485</link><description>FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox.

This issue has been patched in version 5.31.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 06:19:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41235 | CVE-2025-41235: Spring Cloud Gateway Server Forwards Headers from Untrusted Proxies</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41235</link><description>Spring Cloud Gateway Server forwards the X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded headers from untrusted proxies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 06:19:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4429 | WordPress Gearside Developer Dashboard &amp;lt;= 1.0.72 - Reflected XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4429</link><description>The Gearside Developer Dashboard WordPress plugin through 1.0.72 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 06:19:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48490 | Laravel Rest Api has a Search Validation Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48490</link><description>Laravel Rest Api is an API generator. Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass vulnerability was discovered where multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden. Due to how the framework merged validation rules across multiple contexts (such as index, store, and update actions), malicious actors could exploit this behavior by crafting requests that bypass expected validation rules, potentially injecting unexpected or dangerous parameters into the application. This could lead to unauthorized data being accepted or processed by the API, depending on the context in which the validation was bypassed. This issue has been patched in version 2.13.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:40:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48881 | Valtimo backend libraries allows objects in the object-api to be accessed and modified by unauthorized users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48881</link><description>Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation.

If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. At time of publication, no known patches exist.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:40:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4659 | Integration for Salesforce and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Formidable, Ninja Forms &amp;lt;= 1.4.4 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4659</link><description>The Integration for Salesforce and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Formidable, Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4.

In versions starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0, in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py, the MultiModalHasher class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently, it serializes PIL.Image.Image objects using only obj.tobytes(), which returns only the raw pixel data, without including metadata such as the image’s shape (width, height, mode). As a result, two images of different sizes (e.g., 30x100 and 100x30) with the same pixel byte sequence could generate the same hash value. This may lead to hash collisions, incorrect cache hits, and even data leakage or security risks.

can: m_can: m_can_class_allocate_dev(): initialize spin lock on device probe

The spin lock tx_handling_spinlock in struct m_can_classdev is not

complaint from the kernel, eg. when trying to send CAN frames with
cansend from can-utils:

module: ensure that kobject_put() is safe for module type kobjects

In 'lookup_or_create_module_kobject()', an internal kobject is created
using 'module_ktype'. So call to 'kobject_put()' on error handling
path causes an attempt to use an uninitialized completion pointer in
'module_kobject_release()'. In this scenario, we just want to release
kobject without an extra synchronization required for a regular module
unloading process, so adding an extra check whether 'complete()' is
actually required makes 'kobject_put()' safe.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 13:43:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37996 | KVM: arm64: Fix uninitialized memcache pointer in user_mem_abort()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37996</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Fix uninitialized memcache pointer in user_mem_abort()

Commit fce886a60207 ("KVM: arm64: Plumb the pKVM MMU in KVM") made the
initialization of the local memcache variable in user_mem_abort()
conditional, leaving a codepath where it is used uninitialized via
kvm_pgtable_stage2_map().

This can fail on any path that requires a stage-2 allocation
without transition via a permission fault or dirty logging.

Fix this by making sure that memcache is always valid.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 13:43:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37997 | netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37997</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types

Region locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros to handle
the region locks: ahash_bucket_start(), ahash_bucket_end() which gave
back the start and end hash bucket values belonging to a given region
lock and ahash_region() which should give back the region lock belonging
to a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which can lead to a
race condition between the garbage collector and adding new elements
when a hash type of set is defined with timeouts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 13:43:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-37998 | openvswitch: Fix unsafe attribute parsing in output_userspace()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37998</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/erofs/fileio: call erofs_onlinefolio_split() after bio_add_folio()

If bio_add_folio() fails (because it is full),
erofs_fileio_scan_folio() needs to submit the I/O request via
erofs_fileio_rq_submit() and allocate a new I/O request with an empty
`struct bio`.  Then it retries the bio_add_folio() call.

However, at this point, erofs_onlinefolio_split() has already been
called which increments `folio-&gt;private`; the retry will call
erofs_onlinefolio_split() again, but there will never be a matching
erofs_onlinefolio_end() call.  This leaves the folio locked forever
and all waiters will be stuck in folio_wait_bit_common().

This bug has been added by commit ce63cb62d794 ("erofs: support
unencoded inodes for fileio"), but was practically unreachable because
there was room for 256 folios in the `struct bio` - until commit
9f74ae8c9ac9 ("erofs: shorten bvecs[] for file-backed mounts") which
reduced the array capacity to 16 folios.

It was now trivial to trigger the bug by manually invoking readahead
from userspace, e.g.:

 posix_fadvise(fd, 0, st.st_size, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED);

This should be fixed by invoking erofs_onlinefolio_split() only after
bio_add_folio() has succeeded.  This is safe: asynchronous completions
invoking erofs_onlinefolio_end() will not unlock the folio because
erofs_fileio_scan_folio() is still holding a reference to be released
by erofs_onlinefolio_end() at the end.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 13:43:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-48046 | MICI Network Co. Ltd.
