Prior to version 2023.12.3, the login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains a patch for this issue.

When starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release, the login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not authenticated and the request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet. The rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.

However, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 02:35:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-36878 | Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36878</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-40954 | A SQL injection vulnerability in Grzegorz Marczynski Dynamic Progress Bar (aka web_progress) v. 11.0 through 11.0.2, v12.0 through v12.0.2, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40954</link><description>A SQL injection vulnerability in Grzegorz Marczynski Dynamic Progress Bar (aka web_progress) v. 11.0 through 11.0.2, v12.0 through v12.0.2, v.13.0 through v13.0.2, v.14.0 through v14.0.2.1, v.15.0 through v15.0.2, and v16.0 through v16.0.2.1 allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via the recency parameter in models/web_progress.py component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42183 | lockss-daemon (aka Classic LOCKSS Daemon) before 1.77.3 performs post-Unicode normalization, which may allow bypass of intended access restr...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42183</link><description>lockss-daemon (aka Classic LOCKSS Daemon) before 1.77.3 performs post-Unicode normalization, which may allow bypass of intended access restrictions, such as when U+1FEF is converted to a backtick.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48050 | SQL injection vulnerability in Cams Biometrics Zkteco, eSSL, Cams Biometrics Integration Module with HR Attendance (aka odoo-biometric-atten...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48050</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in Cams Biometrics Zkteco, eSSL, Cams Biometrics Integration Module with HR Attendance (aka odoo-biometric-attendance) v. 13.0 through 16.0.1 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and to gain privileges via the db parameter in the controllers/controllers.py component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6831 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27; in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6831</link><description>Path Traversal: '\..\filename' in GitHub repository mlflow/mlflow prior to 2.9.2.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6832 | Business Logic Errors in microweber/microweber</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6832</link><description>Business Logic Errors in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 2.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 01:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48049 | A SQL injection vulnerability in Cybrosys Techno Solutions Website Blog Search (aka website_search_blog) v. 13.0 through 13.0.1.0.1 allows a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48049</link><description>A SQL injection vulnerability in Cybrosys Techno Solutions Website Blog Search (aka website_search_blog) v. 13.0 through 13.0.1.0.1 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and to gain privileges via the name parameter in controllers/main.py component.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 00:00:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4489 | Z/IP Gateway Use of Uninitialized PRNG when Generating S0 Encryption Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4489</link><description>The first S0 encryption key is generated with an uninitialized PRNG in Z/IP Gateway products running Silicon Labs Z/IP Gateway SDK v7.18.3 and earlier.

In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6; Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. Commit d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part of versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 20:09:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-37457 | Asterisk&amp;#x27;s PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can overwrite memory/cause crash when using &amp;#x27;update&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37457</link><description>Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. In Asterisk versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and 21.0.0; as well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5 and prior, the 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur. A patch is available at commit a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 19:52:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49294 | Asterisk Path Traversal vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49294</link><description>Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.17.6 affects users who: authorized an application which requested a 'token write' scope or, using frontend-2, created a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `token write` scope. When creating a new token an agent needs to authorise the request with an existing token (the 'requesting token').  The requesting token is required to have token write scope in order to generate new tokens. However, Speckle server was not verifying that other privileges granted to the new token were not in excess of the privileges of the requesting token. A malicious actor could use a token with only token write scope to subsequently generate further tokens with additional privileges. These privileges would only grant privileges up to the existing privileges of the user. This vulnerability cannot be used to escalate a user's privileges or grant privileges on behalf of other users.

This has been patched as of version 2.17.6. All operators of Speckle servers should upgrade their server to version 2.17.6 or higher. Any users who authorized an application with 'token write' scope, or created a token in frontend-2 with `token write` scope should review existing tokens and permanently revoke any they do not recognize, revoke existing tokens and create new tokens, and review usage of their account for suspicious activity. No known workarounds for this issue exist.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:22:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6563 | Keycloak: offline session token dos</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6563</link><description>An unconstrained memory consumption vulnerability was discovered in Keycloak.

If an attacker creates two or more user sessions and then open the "consents" tab of the admin User Interface, the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:22:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50710 | Hono&amp;#x27;s named path parameters can be overridden in TrieRouter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50710</link><description>Hono is a web framework written in TypeScript. Prior to version 3.11.7, clients may override named path parameter values from previous requests if the application is using TrieRouter. So, there is a risk that a privileged user may use unintended parameters when deleting REST API resources. TrieRouter is used either explicitly or when the application matches a pattern that is not supported by the default RegExpRouter. Version 3.11.7 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, avoid using TrieRouter directly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49151 | WordPress Google Calendar Events Plugin &amp;lt;= 3.2.6 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49151</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Simple Calendar Simple Calendar – Google Calendar Plugin allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Simple Calendar – Google Calendar Plugin: from n/a through 3.2.6.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49152 | WordPress Credit Tracker Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.1.17 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49152</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Labs64 Credit Tracker allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Credit Tracker: from n/a through 1.1.17.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-49157 | WordPress Multiple Post Passwords Plugin &amp;lt;= 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49157</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Andreas Münch Multiple Post Passwords allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Multiple Post Passwords: from n/a through 1.1.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:26:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50269 | SQUID-2023:10 Denial of Service in HTTP Request parsing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50269</link><description>Squid is a caching proxy for the Web.

Moonlight-common-c is vulnerable to buffer overflow starting in commit f57bd745b4cbed577ea654fad4701bea4d38b44c. A malicious game streaming server could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to crash a moonlight client. Achieving RCE is possible but unlikely, due to stack canaries in use by modern compiler toolchains. The published binaries for official clients Qt, Android, iOS/tvOS, and Embedded are built with stack canaries, but some unofficial clients may not use stack canaries. This vulnerability takes place after the pairing process, so it requires the client to be tricked into pairing to a malicious host. It is not possible to perform using a man-in-the-middle due to public key pinning that takes place during the pairing process.

When parsing SVG images Dompdf performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are allowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not reference itself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself.

php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for `image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf, php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-referential `image` references, but a chained reference is not checked. A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or more SVG images.

When Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceeding the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple request to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request.

Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 21:13:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50248 | CKAN out of memory error when submitting the dataset form with a specially-crafted field</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50248</link><description>CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals.

Contracts containing large arrays might underallocate the number of slots they need by 1. Prior to v0.3.8, the calculation to determine how many slots a storage variable needed used `math.ceil(type_.size_in_bytes / 32)`. The intermediate floating point step can produce a rounding error if there are enough bits set in the IEEE-754 mantissa. Roughly speaking, if `type_.size_in_bytes` is large (&gt; 2**46), and slightly less than a power of 2, the calculation can overestimate how many slots are needed by 1. If `type_.size_in_bytes` is slightly more than a power of 2, the calculation can underestimate how many slots are needed by 1. This issue is patched in version 0.3.8.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 19:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6773 | CodeAstro POS and Inventory Management System User Creation register_account access control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6773</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in CodeAstro POS and Inventory Management System 1.0 and classified as problematic.

This means that the data to be written is instead replaced with whatever data had been in the packet buffer previously.  Thus, an unprivileged user with access to an affected system may abuse the bug to trigger disclosure of sensitive information.  In particular, the leak is limited to data previously stored in mbufs, which are used for network transmission and reception, and for certain types of inter-process communication.

The bug can also be triggered unintentionally by system applications, in which case the data written by the application to an NFS mount may be corrupted.  Corrupted data is written over the network to the NFS server, and thus also susceptible to being snooped by other hosts on the network.

Note that the bug exists only in the NFS client; the version and implementation of the server has no effect on whether a given system is affected by the problem.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:36:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-22942 | The vmwgfx driver contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22942</link><description>The vmwgfx driver contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other processes on the system through a dangling 'file' pointer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6534 | TCP spoofing vulnerability in pf(4)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6534</link><description>In versions of FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE before 14-RELEASE-p2, FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE before 13.2-RELEASE-p7 and FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE before 12.4-RELEASE-p9, the pf(4) packet filter incorrectly validates TCP sequence numbers.  This could allow a malicious actor to execute a denial-of-service attack against hosts behind the firewall.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45725 | Apache CouchDB, IBM Cloudant: Privilege Escalation Using _design Documents</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45725</link><description>Design document functions which receive a user http request object may expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who accesses the document.

These design document functions are:
  *    list
  *    show
  *    rewrite
  *    update

An attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with an "update" function.

For the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function from that design document.

Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request object's headers</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47536 | An improper access control vulnerability [CWE-284] in FortiOS version 7.2.0, version 7.0.13 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiPro...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47536</link><description>An improper access control vulnerability [CWE-284] in FortiOS version 7.2.0, version 7.0.13 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiProxy version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.9 and below, version 2.0.12 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the firewall deny geolocalisation policy via timing the bypass with a GeoIP database update.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:23:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46671 | Kibana Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46671</link><description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error.
