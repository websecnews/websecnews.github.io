In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path, the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable, and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping), and then directly renders it using v-html, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API, which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus, the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 18:38:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8061 | A potential insufficient access control vulnerability was reported in the Lenovo Dispatcher 3.0 and Dispatcher 3.1 drivers used by some Leno...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8061</link><description>A potential insufficient access control vulnerability was reported in the Lenovo Dispatcher 3.0 and Dispatcher 3.1 drivers used by some Lenovo consumer notebooks that could allow an authenticated local user to execute code with elevated privileges.

mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lock

When netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holding
kmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lock
inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because
pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to
__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire
kmemleak_lock.

This is the path for the deadlock.

mem_pool_alloc()
  -&gt; raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;kmemleak_lock, flags);
      -&gt; pr_warn_once()
          -&gt; netconsole subsystem
	     -&gt; netpoll
	         -&gt; __alloc_skb
		   -&gt; __create_object
		     -&gt; raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;amp;kmemleak_lock, flags);

Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() after
kmemleak_lock is released.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39737 | mm/kmemleak: avoid soft lockup in __kmemleak_do_cleanup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39737</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/kmemleak: avoid soft lockup in __kmemleak_do_cleanup()

A soft lockup warning was observed on a relative small system x86-64
system with 16 GB of memory when running a debug kernel with kmemleak
enabled.

  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#8 stuck for 33s! [kworker/8:1:134]

The test system was running a workload with hot unplug happening in
parallel.  Then kemleak decided to disable itself due to its inability to
allocate more kmemleak objects.  The debug kernel has its
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE set to 40,000.

The soft lockup happened in kmemleak_do_cleanup() when the existing
kmemleak objects were being removed and deleted one-by-one in a loop via a
workqueue.  In this particular case, there are at least 40,000 objects
that need to be processed and given the slowness of a debug kernel and the
fact that a raw_spinlock has to be acquired and released in
__delete_object(), it could take a while to properly handle all these
objects.

As kmemleak has been disabled in this case, the object removal and
deletion process can be further optimized as locking isn't really needed. 
However, it is probably not worth the effort to optimize for such an edge
case that should rarely happen.  So the simple solution is to call
cond_resched() at periodic interval in the iteration loop to avoid soft
lockup.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39738 | btrfs: do not allow relocation of partially dropped subvolumes</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39738</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not allow relocation of partially dropped subvolumes

[BUG]
There is an internal report that balance triggered transaction abort,
with the following call trace:

  item 85 key (594509824 169 0) itemoff 12599 itemsize 33
          extent refs 1 gen 197740 flags 2

 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -117)
 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6963 at ../fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2168 btrfs_run_delayed_refs+0xfa/0x110 [btrfs]

And btrfs check doesn't report anything wrong related to the extent
tree.

[CAUSE]
The cause is a little complex, firstly the extent tree indeed doesn't
have the backref for 594526208.

The extent tree only have the following two backrefs around that bytenr
on-disk:

        item 65 key (594509824 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13880 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197740 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE
        item 66 key (594558976 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13847 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197522 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE

But the such missing backref item is not an corruption on disk, as the
offending delayed ref belongs to subvolume 934, and that subvolume is
being dropped:

        item 0 key (934 ROOT_ITEM 198229) itemoff 15844 itemsize 439
                generation 198229 root_dirid 256 bytenr 10741039104 byte_limit 0 bytes_used 345571328
                last_snapshot 198229 flags 0x1000000000001(RDONLY) refs 0
                drop_progress key (206324 EXTENT_DATA 2711650304) drop_level 2
                level 2 generation_v2 198229

And that offending tree block 594526208 is inside the dropped range of
that subvolume.  That explains why there is no backref item for that
bytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.

But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan
subvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.

So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and
balance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we
shouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.

The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.
In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same
problem.

It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and
caused those zombie subvolumes.

Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 ("btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot
deletion not triggered on mount") has long fixed the bug.

[ENHANCEMENT]
For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.

Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref
time) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too
late.

Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the
earliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging
similar bugs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39739 | iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Add SM6115 MDSS compatible</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39739</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Forget ranges when refining tnum after JSET

Syzbot reported a kernel warning due to a range invariant violation on
the following BPF program.

  0: call bpf_get_netns_cookie
  1: if r0 == 0 goto 
  2: if r0 &amp; Oxffffffff goto 

The issue is on the path where we fall through both jumps.

That path is unreachable at runtime: after insn 1, we know r0 != 0, but
with the sign extension on the jset, we would only fallthrough insn 2
if r0 == 0. Unfortunately, is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to
figure this out, so the verifier walks all branches. The verifier then
refines the register bounds using the second condition and we end
up with inconsistent bounds on this unreachable path:

  1: if r0 == 0 goto 
    r0: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0xffffffffffffffff)
  2: if r0 &amp; 0xffffffff goto 
    r0 before reg_bounds_sync: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0)
    r0 after reg_bounds_sync:  u64=[0x1, 0] var_off=(0, 0)

Improving the range refinement for JSET to cover all cases is tricky. We
also don't expect many users to rely on JSET given LLVM doesn't generate
those instructions. So instead of improving the range refinement for
JSETs, Eduard suggested we forget the ranges whenever we're narrowing
tnums after a JSET. This patch implements that approach.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39749 | rcu: Protect -&amp;gt;defer_qs_iw_pending from data race</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39749</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Protect -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending from data race

On kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is
invoked within an interrupts-disabled region of code [1], it will invoke
rcu_read_unlock_special(), which uses an irq-work handler to force the
system to notice when the RCU read-side critical section actually ends.
That end won't happen until interrupts are enabled at the soonest.

In some kernels, such as those booted with rcutree.use_softirq=y, the
irq-work handler is used unconditionally.

The per-CPU rcu_data structure's -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending field is
updated by the irq-work handler and is both read and updated by
rcu_read_unlock_special().  This resulted in the following KCSAN splat:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which
means that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,
and that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical
section, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict
KCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on
the -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending field.

This commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the -&gt;defer_qs_iw_pending
field.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast path.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39750 | wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39750</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails

Currently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(),
the tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding
TID is not actually allocated. Proceed to
ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid,
which might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential
crash or out-of-bounds access.

Hence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only
the successfully allocated TIDs.

Also, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(),
as decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.

fs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX

When sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816
as set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near
the limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed
INT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288

This happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the
requested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is
not flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.

Specifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a
process calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:
- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes
- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB
- Total allocation size: &gt; 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)

Reproducer:
1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:
   # echo 1073741816 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/nr_open

2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:
   #include 
   #include resource.h&gt;

   int main() {
       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};
       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &amp;amp;rlim);
       dup2(2, 1073741880);  / Triggers the warning
       return 0;
   }

3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027

systemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the
maximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory
control groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits
since memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked
that:

1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum
   size regardless of memcg accounting
2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can
   inadvertently trigger massive allocations
3. The resulting allocations (&gt;8GB) are impractical and will always fail

systemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value
until the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open
being set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file
descriptors.

While processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal
operation, certain selftests (like
tools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file
descriptor limits can trigger this issue.

Fix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested
allocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to
fail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the
impractical &gt;8GB memory allocation request.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39757 | ALSA: usb-audio: Validate UAC3 cluster segment descriptors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39757</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This means we've been sending oversized iov_iters and tcp_sendmsg calls
for a while. This has a been a benign bug because sendpage_ok() always
returned true. With the recent slab allocator changes being slowly
introduced into next (that disallow sendpage on large kmalloc
allocations), we have recently hit out-of-bounds crashes, due to slight
differences in iov_iter behavior between the MSG_SPLICE_PAGES and
"regular" copy paths:

(MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_splice_from_iter
  iov_iter_extract_pages
    iov_iter_extract_bvec_pages
      uses i-&gt;nr_segs to correctly stop in its tracks before OoB'ing everywhere
  skb_splice_from_iter gets a "short" read

(!MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_copy_to_page_nocache copy=iov_iter_count
 [...]
   copy_from_iter
        /* this doesn't help */
        if (unlikely(iter-&gt;count &lt; len))
                len = iter-&gt;count;
          iterate_bvec
            ... and we run off the bvecs

Fix this by properly setting the iov_iter's byte count, plus sending the
correct byte count to tcp_sendmsg_locked.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39759 | btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39759</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the
rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from
the fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree rbtree.

This happens as follows:

1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -&gt; btrfs_qgroup_rescan();

2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that
   point fs_info-&gt;qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by
   task A);

3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups
   from fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock;

4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating
   the fs_info-&gt;qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock,
   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding
   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by taking fs_info-&gt;qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().
Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas
were already disabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39760 | usb: core: config: Prevent OOB read in SS endpoint companion parsing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39760</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered

If a synchronous error is detected as a result of user-space process
triggering a 2-bit uncorrected error, the CPU will take a synchronous
error exception such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64. The
kernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related
page, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that
a system wide panic can be avoided.

However, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal
synchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like
invalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,
invalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will
trigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform
firmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a
system reboot.

Fix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued
for synchronous errors.

Same pattern as previous patch: do not keep the expectation object

AFAICS this has the same issue as the one resolved in the conntrack
dumper, when we do

net/sched: Make cake_enqueue return NET_XMIT_CN when past buffer_limit

The following setup can trigger a WARNING in htb_activate due to
the condition: !cl-&gt;leaf.q-&gt;q.qlen

tc qdisc del dev lo root
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 \

tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle f: \
       cake memlimit 1b
ping -I lo -f -c1 -s64 -W0.001 127.0.0.1

This is because the low memlimit leads to a low buffer_limit, which
causes packet dropping. However, cake_enqueue still returns
NET_XMIT_SUCCESS, causing htb_enqueue to call htb_activate with an
empty child qdisc. We should return NET_XMIT_CN when packets are
dropped from the same tin and flow.

I do not believe return value of NET_XMIT_CN is necessary for packet
drops in the case of ack filtering, as that is meant to optimize
performance, not to signal congestion.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39767 | LoongArch: Optimize module load time by optimizing PLT/GOT counting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39767</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

After analysis, this is because the slow speed of loading the amdgpu
module leads to the long time occupation of the cpu and then the soft
deadlock.

When loading a module, module_frob_arch_sections() tries to figure out
the number of PLTs/GOTs that will be needed to handle all the RELAs. It
will call the count_max_entries() to find in an out-of-order date which
counting algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.

To make it faster, we sort the relocation list by info and addend. That
way, to check for a duplicate relocation, it just needs to compare with
the previous entry. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n
 log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb ("arm64/module: Optimize module
load time by optimizing PLT counting"). This gives sinificant reduction
in module load time for modules with large number of relocations.

After applying this patch, the soft deadlock problem has been solved,
and the kernel starts normally without "Call Trace".

Using the default configuration to test some modules, the results are as
follows:

Module              Size
ip_tables           36K

net/mlx5: HWS, fix complex rules rehash error flow

Moving rules from matcher to matcher should not fail.
However, if it does fail due to various reasons, the error flow
should allow the kernel to continue functioning (albeit with broken
steering rules) instead of going into series of soft lock-ups or
some other problematic behaviour.

Similar to the simple rules, complex rules rehash logic suffers
from the same problems. This patch fixes the error flow for moving
complex rules:
 - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not
   poll for completion
 - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying
   to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken,
   completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence.
 - If some other completion with error received, don't give up.
   Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage.
 - Make sure that the first error code that was received will
   be actually returned to the caller instead of replacing it
   with the generic error code.

All the aforementioned issues stem from the same bad error flow,
so no point fixing them one by one and leaving partially broken
code - fixing them in one patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39769 | bnxt_en: Fix lockdep warning during rmmod</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39769</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: gso: Forbid IPv6 TSO with extensions on devices with only IPV6_CSUM

When performing Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) on an IPv6 packet that
contains extension headers, the kernel incorrectly requests checksum offload
if the egress device only advertises NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM feature, which has
a strict contract: it supports checksum offload only for plain TCP or UDP
over IPv6 and explicitly does not support packets with extension headers.
The current GSO logic violates this contract by failing to disable the feature
for packets with extension headers, such as those used in GREoIPv6 tunnels.

This violation results in the device being asked to perform an operation
it cannot support, leading to a `skb_warn_bad_offload` warning and a collapse
of network throughput. While device TSO/USO is correctly bypassed in favor
of software GSO for these packets, the GSO stack must be explicitly told not
to request checksum offload.

Mask NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM, NETIF_F_TSO6 and NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_L4
in gso_features_check if the IPv6 header contains extension headers to compute
checksum in software.

The exception is a BIG TCP extension, which, as stated in commit
68e068cabd2c6c53 ("net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets"):
"The feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO.
The header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump,
and not transmitted by physical devices."

iio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Set driver data before enabling runtime PM

When stress-testing the system by repeatedly unbinding and binding the ADC
device in a loop, and the ADC is a supplier for another device (e.g., a
thermal hardware block that reads temperature through the ADC), it may
happen that the ADC device is runtime-resumed immediately after runtime PM
is enabled, triggered by its consumer. At this point, since drvdata is not
yet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can
occur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39775 | mm/mremap: fix WARN with uffd that has remap events disabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39775</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Registering userfaultd on a VMA that spans at least one PMD and then

The code ends up doing the right thing (recurse, avoiding moving actual

The underlying issue is that we recurse during the original page table
move, but not during the recovery move.

Fix it by checking for both VMAs and performing the check before the
pmd_none() sanity check.

Add a new helper where we perform+document that check for the PMD and PUD
level.

Thanks to Harry for bisecting.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39776 | mm/debug_vm_pgtable: clear page table entries at destroy_args()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39776</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/debug_vm_pgtable: clear page table entries at destroy_args()

The mm/debug_vm_pagetable test allocates manually page table entries for
the tests it runs, using also its manually allocated mm_struct.  That in
itself is ok, but when it exits, at destroy_args() it fails to clear those
entries with the *_clear functions.

The problem is that leaves stale entries.  If another process allocates an
mm_struct with a pgd at the same address, it may end up running into the
stale entry.  This is happening in practice on a debug kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE=y, for example this is the output with some extra
debugging I added (it prints a warning trace if pgtables_bytes goes
negative, in addition to the warning at check_mm() function):

btrfs: subpage: keep TOWRITE tag until folio is cleaned

btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() calls folio_start_writeback() the first time
a folio is written back, and it also clears the PAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE tag
even if there are still dirty blocks in the folio. This can break ordering
guarantees, such as those required by btrfs_wait_ordered_extents().

That ordering breakage leads to a real failure. For example, running
generic/464 on a zoned setup will hit the following ASSERT. This happens
because the broken ordering fails to flush existing dirty pages before the

Consider process A calling writepages() with WB_SYNC_NONE. In zoned mode or
for compressed writes, it locks several folios for delalloc and starts
writing them out. Let's call the last locked folio folio X. Suppose the
write range only partially covers folio X, leaving some pages dirty.
Process A calls btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() when building a bio. This
function call clears the TOWRITE tag of folio X, whose size = 8K and
the block size = 4K. It is following state.

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY)
   &lt;-----&gt; Process A will write this range.

Now suppose process B concurrently calls writepages() with WB_SYNC_ALL. It
calls tag_pages_for_writeback() to tag dirty folios with
PAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE. Since folio X is still dirty, it gets tagged. Then,
B collects tagged folios using filemap_get_folios_tag() and must wait for
folio X to be written before returning from writepages().

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY|TOWRITE)

However, between tagging and collecting, process A may call
btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() and clear folio X's TOWRITE tag.
   0     4K    8K
   |     |/////|  (flag: DIRTY|WRITEBACK, tag: DIRTY)

As a result, process B won't see folio X in its batch, and returns without
waiting for it. This breaks the WB_SYNC_ALL ordering requirement.

Fix this by using btrfs_subpage_set_writeback_keepwrite(), which retains
the TOWRITE tag. We now manually clear the tag only after the folio becomes
clean, via the xas operation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:08:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39780 | sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39780</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()

Both jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() and jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list()
periodically release j_list_lock after processing a batch of buffers to
avoid long hold times on the j_list_lock. However, since both functions
contend for j_list_lock, the combined time spent waiting and processing
can be significant.

jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() explicitly calls cond_resched() when
need_resched() is true to avoid softlockups during prolonged operations.
But jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() only exits its loop when need_resched() is
true, relying on potentially sleeping functions like __flush_batch() or
wait_on_buffer() to trigger rescheduling. If those functions do not sleep,
the kernel may hit a softlockup.

scsi: ufs: exynos: Fix programming of HCI_UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE

On Google gs101, the number of UTP transfer request slots (nutrs) is 32,
and in this case the driver ends up programming the UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE
incorrectly as 0.

This is because the left hand side of the shift is 1, which is of type
int, i.e. 31 bits wide. Shifting by more than that width results in
undefined behaviour.

Fix this by switching to the BIT() macro, which applies correct type
casting as required. This ensures the correct value is written to
UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE (0xffffffff on gs101), and it also fixes a UBSAN shift
warning:

    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/ufs/host/ufs-exynos.c:1113:21

bus: mhi: host: Detect events pointing to unexpected TREs

When a remote device sends a completion event to the host, it contains a
pointer to the consumed TRE. The host uses this pointer to process all of
the TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer.
This works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can
lead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element
transaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the
host's read pointer.

For instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is
updating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old
TRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer
pointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.

This behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without
'commit 6f18d174b73d ("bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer
is written")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before
updating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to
access the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the
chance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an
event pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed
one, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all
of the TREs in between the two read pointers.

This commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the
event points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.

dm: dm-crypt: Do not partially accept write BIOs with zoned targets

Read and write operations issued to a dm-crypt target may be split
according to the dm-crypt internal limits defined by the max_read_size
and max_write_size module parameters (default is 128 KB). The intent is
to improve processing time of large BIOs by splitting them into smaller
operations that can be parallelized on different CPUs.

For zoned dm-crypt targets, this BIO splitting is still done but without
the parallel execution to ensure that the issuing order of write
operations to the underlying devices remains sequential. However, the
splitting itself causes other problems:

1) Since dm-crypt relies on the block layer zone write plugging to
   handle zone append emulation using regular write operations, the
   reminder of a split write BIO will always be plugged into the target
   zone write plugged. Once the on-going write BIO finishes, this
   reminder BIO is unplugged and issued from the zone write plug work.
   If this reminder BIO itself needs to be split, the reminder will be
   re-issued and plugged again, but that causes a call to a
   blk_queue_enter(), which may block if a queue freeze operation was
   initiated. This results in a deadlock as DM submission still holds
   BIOs that the queue freeze side is waiting for.

2) dm-crypt relies on the emulation done by the block layer using
   regular write operations for processing zone append operations. This
   still requires to properly return the written sector as the BIO
   sector of the original BIO. However, this can be done correctly only
   and only if there is a single clone BIO used for processing the
   original zone append operation issued by the user. If the size of a
   zone append operation is larger than dm-crypt max_write_size, then
   the orginal BIO will be split and processed as a chain of regular
   write operations. Such chaining result in an incorrect written sector
   being returned to the zone append issuer using the original BIO
   sector.  This in turn results in file system data corruptions using
   xfs or btrfs.

Fix this by modifying get_max_request_size() to always return the size
of the BIO to avoid it being split with dm_accpet_partial_bio() in
crypt_map(). get_max_request_size() is renamed to
get_max_request_sectors() to clarify the unit of the value returned
and its interface is changed to take a struct dm_target pointer and a
pointer to the struct bio being processed. In addition to this change,
to ensure that crypt_alloc_buffer() works correctly, set the dm-crypt
device max_hw_sectors limit to be at most
BIO_MAX_VECS &lt;&lt; PAGE_SECTORS_SHIFT (1 MB with a 4KB page architecture).
This forces DM core to split write BIOs before passing them to
crypt_map(), and thus guaranteeing that dm-crypt can always accept an
entire write BIO without needing to split it.

This change does not have any effect on the read path of dm-crypt. Read
operations can still be split and the BIO fragments processed in
parallel. There is also no impact on the performance of the write path
given that all zone write BIOs were already processed inline instead of
in parallel.

This change also does not affect in any way regular dm-crypt block
devices.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:09:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26499 | Under heavy system utilization a random race condition can occur during authentication or token refresh operation.

x86/vmscape: Add conditional IBPB mitigation

VMSCAPE is a vulnerability that exploits insufficient branch predictor
isolation between a guest and a userspace hypervisor (like QEMU). Existing
mitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace
can additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a
VMexit.

Since it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,
conditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to
userspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and
userspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.

This new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For
instance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to
get an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the
IBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running
userspace.

The intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.

There are two issues related to the mapping of pages belonging to other
domains: For one, an assertion is wrong there, where the case actually
needs handling.  A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release
build.  This is CVE-2025-58144.

And then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually
obtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can
not only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing
domain boundaries to be violated.

Angular uses a DI container (the "platform injector") to hold request-specific state during server-side rendering. For historical reasons, the container was stored as a JavaScript module-scoped global variable. When multiple requests are processed concurrently, they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state. In practical terms, this can lead to one request responding with data meant for a completely different request, leaking data or tokens included on the rendered page or in response headers. As long as an attacker had network access to send any traffic that received a rendered response, they may have been able to send a large number of requests and then inspect the responses for information leaks. The APIs `bootstrapApplication`, `getPlatform`, and `destroyPlatform` were vulnerable and required SSR-only breaking changes.
The issue has been patched in all active release lines as well as in the v21 prerelease. Patched packages include `@angular/platform-server` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.15, and 18.2.14 and `@angular/ssr` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.16, and 18.2.21. Several workarounds are available. Disable SSR via Server Routes or builder options, remove any asynchronous behavior from custom `bootstrap` functions, remove uses of `getPlatform()` in application code, and/or ensure that the server build defines `ngJitMode` as false.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 20:33:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45669 | IBM Security Verify Information Queue denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45669</link><description>IBM Security Verify Information Queue 10.0.5, 10.0.6, 10.0.7, and 10.0.8 could allow a remote user to cause a denial of service due to improper handling of special characters that could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 20:16:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45671 | IBM Security Verify Information Queue information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45671</link><description>IBM Security Verify Information Queue 10.0.5, 10.0.6, 10.0.7, and 10.0.8

In versions 1.11.3 and prior, the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks, an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 disables the set middleware API by default, and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 18:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9714 | Stack overflow in libxml2</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9714</link><description>Uncontrolled recursion in XPath evaluation in libxml2 up to and including version 2.9.14 allows a local attacker to cause a stack overflow via crafted expressions.

Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand` function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests recurring events in their expanded form using the `` element, the server stores all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible, implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted users only.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:13:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43725 | Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerabi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43725</link><description>Dell PowerProtect Data Manager, Generic Application Agent, version(s) 19.19 and 19.20, contain(s) an Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability.

Himmelblau 0.9.x derives numeric GIDs for Entra ID groups from the group display name when himmelblau.conf `id_attr_map = name` (the default configuration). Because Microsoft Entra ID allows multiple groups with the same `displayName` (including end-user–created personal/O365 groups, depending on tenant policy), distinct directory groups can collapse to the same numeric GID on Linux. This issue only applies to Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.22. Any resource or service on a Himmelblau-joined host that enforces authorization by numeric GID (files/dirs, etc.) can be unintentionally accessible to a user who creates or joins a different Entra/O365 group that happens to share the same `displayName` as a privileged security group. Users should upgrade to 0.9.23, or 1.0.0 or later, to receive a patch. Group to GID mapping now uses Entra ID object IDs (GUIDs) and does not collide on same-name groups. As a workaround, use tenant policy hardening to restrict arbitrary group creation until all hosts are patched.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 22:42:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59046 | interactive-git-checkout has Command Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59046</link><description>The npm package `interactive-git-checkout` is an interactive command-line tool that allows users to checkout a git branch while it prompts for the branch name on the command-line.

Due to a special entry being appended to `sys.path` during the bootstrap process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present in `sys.path`, an application built with PyInstaller &lt; 6.0.0 may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code when **all** of the following conditions are met. First, the application is built with PyInstaller &lt; 6.0.0; both onedir and onefile mode are affected. Second, the optional bytecode encryption code feature was not enabled during the application build. Third, the attacker can create files/directories in the same directory where the executable is located. Fourth, the filesystem supports creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows systems). Fifth, the attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive is embedded in the executable. The attacker can create a directory (or a zip archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself. If the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation. PyInstaller 6.0.0 (f5adf291c8b832d5aff7632844f7e3ddf7ad4923) removed support for bytecode encryption; this effectively removes the described attack vector, due to the bootstrap script not attempting to load the optional module for bytecode-decryption anymore. PyInstaller 6.10.0 (cfd60b510f95f92cb81fc42735c399bb781a4739) reworked the bootstrap process to avoid (ab)using `sys.path` for transmitting location of the PYZ archive, which further eliminates the possibility of described injection procedure. If upgrading PyInstaller is not feasible, this issue can be worked around by ensuring proper permissions on directories containing security-sensitive executables (i.e., executables with `setuid` bit set) should mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 22:33:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58447 | rAthena has heap-based buffer overflow in login server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58447</link><description>rAthena is an open-source cross-platform massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) server.

A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:32:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58765 | wabac.js has XSS vulnerability in 404 error handling logic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58765</link><description>wabac.js provides a full web archive replay system, or 'wayback machine', using Service Workers.

In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. Users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7635 | Calix GigaCenter ONT - Unauthenticated Telnet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7635</link><description>Unauthenticated Telnet access vulnerability in Calix GigaCenter ONT allows root access.This issue affects GigaCenter ONT: 844E, 844G, 844GE, 854GE.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34173 | Netgate pfSense CE Snort package v4.1.6_25 Directory Traversal Information Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34173</link><description>In pfSense CE /usr/local/www/snort/snort_ip_reputation.php, the value of the iplist parameter is not sanitized of directory traversal-related characters/strings before being used to check if a file exists.

The `/image` API endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. In Tautulli, the `/image` API endpoint is used to serve static images from the application's data directory to users. This endpoint can be accessed without authentication, and its intended purpose is for server background images and icons within the user interface.

The `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories. An attacker can exfiltrate files on the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-53913 | Calix GigaCenter ONT (Quantenna SoC) - Excessive Privileges</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53913</link><description>Excessive Privileges vulnerability in Calix GigaCenter ONT (Quantenna SoC modules) allows Privilege Abuse.This issue affects GigaCenter ONT: 844E, 844G, 844GE, 854GE, 812G, 813G, 818G.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58753 | copyparty: Sharing a single file does not fully restrict access to other files in source folder</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58753</link><description>Copyparty is a portable file server. In versions prior to 1.19.8, there was a missing permission-check in the shares feature (the `shr` global-option). When a share was created for just one file inside a folder, it was possible to access the other files inside that folder by guessing the filenames. It was not possible to descend into subdirectories in this manner; only the sibling files were accessible. This issue did not affect filekeys or dirkeys. Version 1.19.8 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58758 | TinyEnv: Missing .env file not required — may cause unexpected behavior</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58758</link><description>TinyEnv is an environment variable loader for PHP applications. In versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.9, and 1.0.10, TinyEnv did not require the `.env` file to exist when loading environment variables. This could lead to unexpected behavior where the application silently ignores missing configuration, potentially causing insecure defaults or deployment misconfigurations. The issue has been fixed in version 1.0.11. All users should upgrade to 1.0.11 or later. As a workaround, users can manually verify the existence of the `.env` file before initializing TinyEnv.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58759 | TinyEnv: Inline comments not stripped properly in .env values</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58759</link><description>TinyEnv is an environment variable loader for PHP applications. In versions 1.0.9 and 1.0.10, TinyEnv did not properly strip inline comments inside .env values. This could lead to unexpected behavior or misconfiguration, where variables contain unintended characters (including # or comment text). Applications depending on strict environment values may expose logic errors, insecure defaults, or failed authentication. The issue is fixed in v1.0.11. Users should upgrade to the latest patched version. As a temporary workaround, avoid using inline comments in .env files, or sanitize loaded values manually.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:14:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58435 | Open OnDemand didn&amp;#x27;t rotate password for VNC batch_connect</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58435</link><description>Open OnDemand is an open-source HPC portal. Prior to versions 3.1.15 and 4.0.7, noVNC interactive applications did not correctly rotate the password when TurboVNC was higher than version 3.1.2. The likelihood of exploitation is low as a user would need to share their link to an active desktop session and the other user would need to be authenticated to the portal. But obtaining the link would allow that user to perform any actions as the original user and access their data. Open OnDemand 3.1.15 and 4.0.7 have patched this vulnerability and correctly rotate passwords for any version of TurboVNC. As a workaround, downgrade TurboVNC to a version lower than 3.1.2.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:54:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58442 | Saleor has user enumeration vulnerability due to different error messages</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58442</link><description>Saleor is an e-commerce platform.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to upload a file under a specially crafted filename that will allow arbitrary command execution if said filename becomes included in a command defined in a system event handler and said event gets triggered. If no event handlers executing system commands with uploaded filenames as parameters have been configured, this vulnerability does not have an impact. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.11.3. As a workaround, OctoPrint administrators who have event handlers configured that include any kind of filename based placeholders should disable those by setting their `enabled` property to `False` or unchecking the "Enabled" checkbox in the GUI based Event Manager. Alternatively, OctoPrint administrators should set `feature.enforceReallyUniversalFilenames` to `true` in `config.yaml` and restart OctoPrint, then vet the existing uploads and make sure to delete any suspicious looking files. As always, OctoPrint administrators are advised to not expose OctoPrint on hostile networks like the public internet, and to vet who has access to their instance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:46:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58430 | listmonk Vulnerable to CSRF to XSS Chain That Can Lead to Admin Account Takeover</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-58430</link><description>listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager.

Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks.

The component passes user-controlled href values directly to underlying anchor elements without protocol validation, URL sanitization, or security headers.

While native HTML anchor elements present similar risks, UI component libraries bear additional responsibility for implementing security safeguards and providing clear risk documentation. The vulnerability enables XSS attacks, phishing campaigns, and open redirect exploits affecting applications that use Element Plus Link components with user-controlled or untrusted URL inputs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:44:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10198 | LizardBytes Sunshine for Windows contains a DLL search-order hijacking vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10198</link><description>Sunshine for Windows, version v2025.122.141614, contains a DLL search-order hijacking vulnerability, allowing attackers to insert a malicious DLL in user-writeable PATH directories.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10199 | A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in LizardBytes&amp;#x27; Sunshine for Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10199</link><description>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Sunshine for Windows (version v2025.122.141614 and likely prior versions) due to an unquoted service path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 17:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-57078 | Tenda G3 v3.0br_V15.11.0.17 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the pppoeServerWhiteMacIndex parameter in the formModifyPppAuthWhi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-57078</link><description>Tenda G3 v3.0br_V15.11.0.17 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the pppoeServerWhiteMacIndex parameter in the formModifyPppAuthWhiteMac function.
