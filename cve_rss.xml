mm: zswap: fix missing folio cleanup in writeback race path

In zswap_writeback_entry(), after we get a folio from
__read_swap_cache_async(), we grab the tree lock again to check that the
swap entry was not invalidated and recycled.  If it was, we delete the
folio we just added to the swap cache and exit.

However, __read_swap_cache_async() returns the folio locked when it is
newly allocated, which is always true for this path, and the folio is
ref'd.  Make sure to unlock and put the folio before returning.

This was discovered by code inspection, probably because this path handles
a race condition that should not happen often, and the bug would not crash
the system, it will only strand the folio indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:11:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26833 | drm/amd/display: Fix memory leak in dm_sw_fini()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26833</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: set dormant flag on hook register failure

We need to set the dormant flag again if we fail to register
the hooks.

During memory pressure hook registration can fail and we end up
with a table marked as active but no registered hooks.

On table/base chain deletion, nf_tables will attempt to unregister
the hook again which yields a warn splat from the nftables core.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:11:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26836 | platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix password opcode ordering for workstations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26836</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload

Before this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay
would race against the creation of new group memberships, either from
the IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.

While new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of
br-&gt;mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event
subscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay
list was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,
it would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.

The driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally
considered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only
a single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a
consequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at
least DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware
database when the bridge was destroyed.

This is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events
may still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have
been removed from br-&gt;mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in
that scenario.

To a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in
which a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in
hardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's
knowledge.

For example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and
immediately add a port to it:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 &amp;&amp; \
    &gt; ip link set dev x3 up master br0

And then destroy the bridge:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu
    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X
    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$

The two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the
port (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the
original event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete
notification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is
destroyed.

Then add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware
domain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 &amp;&amp; \
    &gt; ip link set dev x3 up master br1

All multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be
flooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old
memberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the
switch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port
0).

Eliminate the race in two steps:

1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay
   list.

This prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating
the replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event
was already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the
lock. Therefore:

2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already
   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the
   replay list, when replaying additions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:11:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26838 | RDMA/irdma: Fix KASAN issue with tasklet</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26838</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter

Syzkaller reports a warning in _copy_from_iter because an
iov_iter is supposedly used in the wrong direction. The reason
is that syzcaller managed to generate a request with
a transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructs
the kernel to copy user buffers into the kernel, read into
the copied buffers and then copy the data back to user space.

Thus the iovec is used in both directions.

Detect this situation in the block layer and construct a new
iterator with the correct direction for the copy-in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:11:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26845 | scsi: target: core: Add TMF to tmr_list handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26845</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module

The module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and
freeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization
between nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial
commit.

There is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in
wait_for_completion, though it does not handling all cases. E.g.
blktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload
hangs forever.

If we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the
nvme_delete_ctrl path, all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes
calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all
nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave
nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq
workqueue.

While at it, remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 10:11:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26829 | media: ir_toy: fix a memleak in irtoy_tx</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26829</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: relax mount_setattr() permission checks

When we added mount_setattr() I added additional checks compared to the
legacy do_reconfigure_mnt() and do_change_type() helpers used by regular
mount(2). If that mount had a parent then verify that the caller and the
mount namespace the mount is attached to match and if not make sure that
it's an anonymous mount.

The real rootfs falls into neither category. It is neither an anoymous
mount because it is obviously attached to the initial mount namespace
but it also obviously doesn't have a parent mount. So that means legacy
mount(2) allows changing mount properties on the real rootfs but
mount_setattr(2) blocks this. I never thought much about this but of
course someone on this planet of earth changes properties on the real
rootfs as can be seen in [1].

Since util-linux finally switched to the new mount api in 2.39 not so
long ago it also relies on mount_setattr() and that surfaced this issue
when Fedora 39 finally switched to it.

nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup

rx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processing
fragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processed
or when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.
However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skb
leak.

As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device and
nothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed in
some way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.

mptcp: fix data re-injection from stale subflow

When the MPTCP PM detects that a subflow is stale, all the packet
scheduler must re-inject all the mptcp-level unacked data. To avoid
acquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data
is present at all in the RTX queue, but such check is currently
broken, as it uses TCP-specific helper on an MPTCP socket.

Funnily enough fuzzers and static checkers are happy, as the accessed
memory still belongs to the mptcp_sock struct, and even from a
functional perspective the recovery completed successfully, as
the short-cut test always failed.

A recent unrelated TCP change - commit d5fed5addb2b ("tcp: reorganize
tcp_sock fast path variables") - exposed the issue, as the tcp field
reorganization makes the mptcp code always skip the re-inection.

i2c: qcom-geni: Correct I2C TRE sequence

For i2c read operation in GSI mode, we are getting timeout
due to malformed TRE basically incorrect TRE sequence
in gpi(drivers/dma/qcom/gpi.c) driver.

I2C driver has geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_WRITE) function which generates GO TRE and
geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_READ)generates DMA TRE. Hence to generate GO TRE before
DMA TRE, we should move geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_WRITE) before
geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_READ) inside the I2C GSI mode transfer function
i.e. geni_i2c_gpi_xfer().

TRE stands for Transfer Ring Element - which is basically an element with
size of 4 words. It contains all information like slave address,
clk divider, dma address value data size etc).

Mainly we have 3 TREs(Config, GO and DMA tre).
- CONFIG TRE : consists of internal register configuration which is
               required before start of the transfer.
- DMA TRE :    contains DDR/Memory address, called as DMA descriptor.
- GO TRE :     contains Transfer directions, slave ID, Delay flags, Length
               of the transfer.

I2c driver calls GPI driver API to config each TRE depending on the
protocol.

For read operation tre sequence will be as below which is not aligned
to hardware programming guide.

- CONFIG tre
- DMA tre
- GO tre

As per Qualcomm's internal Hardware Programming Guide, we should configure
TREs in below sequence for any RX only transfer.

i40e: Do not allow untrusted VF to remove administratively set MAC

Currently when PF administratively sets VF's MAC address and the VF
is put down (VF tries to delete all MACs) then the MAC is removed
from MAC filters and primary VF MAC is zeroed.

Do not allow untrusted VF to remove primary MAC when it was set
administratively by PF.

Reproducer:
1) Create VF
2) Set VF interface up
3) Administratively set the VF's MAC
4) Put VF interface down

net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1

Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:

Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but
    handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000
    req == 0000000060f99b40
not ok 11 req_destroy works

This is because "sock_release(sock)" was replaced with "fput(filp)"
to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.

The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed
but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
followed by closing the file actually does call the -&gt;hp_destroy
method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the
final close is complete before it checks the pointer.

We cannot use a completion here because if -&gt;hp_destroy is never
called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.

MSAL.NET applications targeting Xamarin Android and .NET Android (e.g., MAUI) using the library from versions 4.48.0 to 4.60.0 are impacted by a low severity vulnerability.   
A malicious application running on a customer Android device    can cause local denial of service against applications that were built using MSAL.NET for authentication on the same device (i.e., prevent the user of the legitimate application from logging in) due to incorrect activity export configuration. MSAL.NET version 4.60.1 includes the fix.  As a workaround, a developer may explicitly mark the MSAL.NET activity non-exported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 21:44:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21061 | No english

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

The l2cpd process is responsible for layer 2 control protocols, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP, VSTP, ERP, and LLDP.  The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP, leading to a Denial of Service.  Continued receipt and processing of this specific TLV will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. One scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. Because SSH is sometimes used to authenticate to Git services, it is possible that this vulnerability could be leveraged for supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. It is also conceivable that signed messages from PuTTY or Pageant are readable by adversaries more easily in other scenarios, but none have yet been disclosed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 20:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32036 | Use After Free in SixLabors.ImageSharp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32036</link><description>ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API.

A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit this flaw.  This flaw can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on ImageSharp for image processing tasks. Users and administrators are advised to update to the latest version of ImageSharp that addresses this vulnerability to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

When the A...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28056</link><description>Amazon AWS Amplify CLI before 12.10.1 incorrectly configures the role trust policy of IAM roles associated with Amplify projects. When the Authentication component is removed from an Amplify project, a Condition property is removed but "Effect":"Allow" remains present, and consequently sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity would be available to threat actors with no conditions. Thus, if Amplify CLI had been used to remove the Authentication component from a project built between August 2019 and January 2024, an "assume role" may have occurred, and may have been leveraged to obtain unauthorized access to an organization's AWS resources. NOTE: the problem could only occur if an authorized AWS user removed an Authentication component. (The vulnerability did not give a threat actor the ability to remove an Authentication component.) However, in realistic situations, an authorized AWS user may have removed an Authentication component, e.g., if the objective were to stop using built-in Cognito resources, or move to a completely different identity provider.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 17:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38511 | iTop Dashboard editor vulnerable dashboard config file parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38511</link><description>iTop is an IT service management platform.
