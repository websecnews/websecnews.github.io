This is due to a lack of validation and missing capability check on user-supplied data in the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 12:46:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-3410 | Bricks &amp;lt;= 1.10.1 - Authenticated (Bricks Page Builder Access+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3410</link><description>The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 08:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8797 | WP Booking System – Booking Calendar &amp;lt;= 2.0.19.8 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8797</link><description>The WP Booking System – Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg &amp; remove_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19.8.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 03:36:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8246 | Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) &amp;lt;= 2.8.11 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8246</link><description>The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 03:23:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8479 | Simple Spoiler 1.2 - 1.3 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8479</link><description>The The Simple Spoiler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in versions 1.2 to 1.3.

This is due to plugin not enforcing server-side checks on the products that can be added as a gift. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add non-gift items to their cart as a gift.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 02:34:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8271 | FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce &amp;lt;= 1.4.2.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8271</link><description>The The FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2.1. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode in the 'woocs_get_custom_price_html' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 02:34:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8775 | Ansible: exposure of sensitive information in ansible vault files due to improper logging</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8775</link><description>A flaw was found in Ansible, where sensitive information stored in Ansible Vault files can be exposed in plaintext during the execution of a playbook. This occurs when using tasks such as include_vars to load vaulted variables without setting the no_log: true parameter, resulting in sensitive data being printed in the playbook output or logs. This can lead to the unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords or API keys, compromising security and potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 02:34:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29779 | there is a possible escalation of privilege due to an unusual root cause.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator's browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly mitigating the potential impact.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 17:30:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3100 | A potential buffer overflow vulnerability was reported in some Lenovo Notebook products that

It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 17:30:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31414 | The Eaton Foreseer software provides users the capability to customize the dashboard in WebView pages.

Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using
accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays
in the guest making all of the extra work they're doing to synchronize
between guest and host useless.

Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics
memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login
manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use.

Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on

libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir

After we switch tmpfs dir operations from simple_dir_operations to
simple_offset_dir_operations, every rename happened will fill new dentry
to dest dir's maple tree(&amp;amp;SHMEM_I(inode)-&gt;dir_offsets-&gt;mt) with a free
key starting with octx-&gt;newx_offset, and then set newx_offset equals to
free key + 1. This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename
happened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show
as below).

1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir
2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry
3. rename(entry, "TEMPFILE"), then rename("TEMPFILE", entry)
4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many
   times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)

We choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf ("btrfs: fix infinite
directory reads") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and
do not emit the entry which index &gt;= last_index. The file-&gt;private_data
now used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update
the last_index when we llseek the dir file.

thunderbolt: Mark XDomain as unplugged when router is removed

I noticed that when we do discrete host router NVM upgrade and it gets
hot-removed from the PCIe side as a result of NVM firmware authentication,
if there is another host connected with enabled paths we hang in tearing
them down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver
also tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in
tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() waiting for the domain lock.

However, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so
there is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do that
anymore. Furthermore it already checks if the XDomain is unplugged and
bails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain as
unplugged when we remove the parent router.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 06:41:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46703 | Revert &amp;quot;serial: 8250_omap: Set the console genpd always on if no console suspend&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46703</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

workqueue: Fix spruious data race in __flush_work()

When flushing a work item for cancellation, __flush_work() knows that it
exclusively owns the work item through its PENDING bit. 134874e2eee9
("workqueue: Allow cancel_work_sync() and disable_work() from atomic
contexts on BH work items") added a read of @work-&gt;data to determine whether
to use busy wait for BH work items that are being canceled. While the read
is safe when @from_cancel, @work-&gt;data was read before testing @from_cancel
to simplify code structure:

	data = *work_data_bits(work);
	if (from_cancel &amp;&amp;
	    !WARN_ON_ONCE(data &amp; WORK_STRUCT_PWQ) &amp;&amp; (data &amp; WORK_OFFQ_BH)) {

While the read data was never used if !@from_cancel, this could trigger
KCSAN data race detection spuriously:

Reorganize the code so that @from_cancel is tested before @work-&gt;data is

Set our various mmio mappings to NULL. This should make it easier to
catch something rogue trying to mess with mmio after device removal. For
example, we might unmap everything and then start hitting some mmio
address which has already been unmamped by us and then remapped by
something else, causing all kinds of carnage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 06:41:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46706 | tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: mark last busy before uart_add_one_port</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46706</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: mark last busy before uart_add_one_port

With "earlycon initcall_debug=1 loglevel=8" in bootargs, kernel
sometimes boot hang. It is because normal console still is not ready,
but runtime suspend is called, so early console putchar will hang
in waiting TRDE set in UARTSTAT.

The lpuart driver has auto suspend delay set to 3000ms, but during
uart_add_one_port, a child device serial ctrl will added and probed with
its pm runtime enabled(see serial_ctrl.c).
The runtime suspend call path is:
device_add
     |-&gt; bus_probe_device
           |-&gt;device_initial_probe
	           |-&gt;__device_attach
                         |-&gt; pm_runtime_get_sync(dev-&gt;parent);
			 |-&gt; pm_request_idle(dev);
			 |-&gt; pm_runtime_put(dev-&gt;parent);

So in the end, before normal console ready, the lpuart get runtime
suspended. And earlycon putchar will hang.

To address the issue, mark last busy just after pm_runtime_enable,
three seconds is long enough to switch from bootconsole to normal
console.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 06:41:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46707 | KVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46707</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3

On a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasn't been configured with
GICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation,
a write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to EL2.

We therefore try to emulate the SGI access, only to hit a NULL
pointer as no private interrupt is allocated (no GIC, remember?).

The obvious fix is to give the guest what it deserves, in the
shape of a UNDEF exception.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 06:41:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38816 | CVE-2024-38816: Path traversal vulnerability in functional web frameworks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38816</link><description>Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access

This commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an
invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing
SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem
arises from the following sequence.
        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when
        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the
        run/stop bit by software.
        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of
        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and
        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event
        buffer address.

To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures
that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before
clearing the buffer address.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 05:35:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46676 | nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46676</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling check

In case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 this
combination successfully passes the check
'if (!im_protocols &amp;&amp; !tm_protocols)' in the nfc_start_poll().
But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll()
poll mod list will remain empty and dev-&gt;poll_mod_count will remain 0
which lead to division by zero.

Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask, so this combination is
not expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come from
userspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So a
broken or malicious program may pass a message containing a "bad"
combination of protocol parameter values so that dev-&gt;poll_mod_count
is not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list(), thus leading
to division by zero.
Call trace looks like:
nfc_genl_start_poll()
  nfc_start_poll()
    -&gt;start_poll()
    pn533_start_poll()

Add poll mod list filling check.

Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix random crash seen while removing driver

This fixes the random kernel crash seen while removing the driver, when
running the load/unload test over multiple iterations.

1) modprobe btnxpuart
2) hciconfig hci0 reset
3) hciconfig (check hci0 interface up with valid BD address)
4) modprobe -r btnxpuart
Repeat steps 1 to 4

The ps_wakeup() call in btnxpuart_close() schedules the psdata-&gt;work(),
which gets scheduled after module is removed, causing a kernel crash.

This hidden issue got highlighted after enabling Power Save by default
in 4183a7be7700 (Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Enable Power Save feature on
startup)

The new ps_cleanup() deasserts UART break immediately while closing
serdev device, cancels any scheduled ps_work and destroys the ps_lock
mutex.

nfsd: prevent panic for nfsv4.0 closed files in nfs4_show_open

Prior to commit 3f29cc82a84c ("nfsd: split sc_status out of

type before calling into a subfunction to show content of a
particular stateid. From that commit, we split the validity of
the stateid into sc_status and no longer changed sc_type to 0
while unhashing the stateid. This resulted in kernel oopsing
for nfsv4.0 opens that stay around and in nfs4_show_open()
would derefence sc_file which was NULL.

Instead, for closed open stateids forgo displaying information
that relies of having a valid sc_file.

To reproduce: mount the server with 4.0, read and close
a file and then on the server cat /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/2/states

drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence

The fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current design
anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to
prevent the queue from being freed.

However, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the
queue ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter is
kicked to wake up at some later point, where upon waking up it first
grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already
dropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of
the queue, leading to uaf.

To prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't
run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level
lock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, however
that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.

[CAUSE]
Although I cannot reproduce the error, the report itself is good enough
to pin down the cause.

The call trace is the regular endio workqueue context, but the
free-by-task trace is showing that during btrfs_submit_chunk() we
already hit a critical error, and is calling btrfs_bio_end_io() to error
out.  And the original endio function called bio_put() to free the whole
bio.

This means a double freeing thus causing use-after-free, e.g.:

1. Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio
   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.

2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K
2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()
    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other
    referring to the second 64K.
2.3 The first half is submitted.

3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed
    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error

3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function
    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the
    original bio.

    Now the original bio is freed.

4. The submitted first 64K bio finished
   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio
   iter.
   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we
   trigger the above use-after free.

   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call
   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),
which has the extra check on split bios and do the pr

erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails

If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to
memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),
new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid
memory leaks.

However, the old gbuf-&gt;pages[] array may not be large enough, which can
lead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.

Fix this by checking against gbuf-&gt;nrpages in advance.

soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB

Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write
protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction
as "write" into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt
which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.

The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor
maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation
tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like
Xen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.

Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC
removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch
fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.

I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 05:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46690 | nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46690</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: Move unregister out of atomic section

Commit '9329933699b3 ("soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Make client-lock
non-sleeping")' moved the pmic_glink client list under a spinlock, as it
is accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback, which in turn is invoked from
IRQ context.

This means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context,
which isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort is
under way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context,
but until then lets schedule the unregistration.

A side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen
after the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, is
gone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL
pointer dereference.
This does however result in the user being informed about this error by
the following entry in the kernel log:

soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Fix race during initialization

As pointed out by Stephen Boyd it is possible that during initialization
of the pmic_glink child drivers, the protection-domain notifiers fires,
and the associated work is scheduled, before the client registration
returns and as a result the local "client" pointer has been initialized.

The outcome of this is a NULL pointer dereference as the "client"
pointer is blindly dereferenced.

This code is identical across the altmode, battery manager and usci
child drivers.

Resolve this by splitting the allocation of the "client" object and the
registration thereof into two operations.

This only happens if the protection domain registry is populated at the
time of registration, which by the introduction of commit '1ebcde047c54

selinux,smack: don't bypass permissions check in inode_setsecctx hook

Marek Gresko reports that the root user on an NFS client is able to
change the security labels on files on an NFS filesystem that is
exported with root squashing enabled.

The end of the kerneldoc comment for __vfs_setxattr_noperm() states:

 *  This function requires the caller to lock the inode's i_mutex before it
 *  is executed. It also assumes that the caller will make the appropriate
 *  permission checks.

nfsd_setattr() does do permissions checking via fh_verify() and
nfsd_permission(), but those don't do all the same permissions checks
that are done by security_inode_setxattr() and its related LSM hooks do.

Since nfsd_setattr() is the only consumer of security_inode_setsecctx(),
simplest solution appears to be to replace the call to
__vfs_setxattr_noperm() with a call to __vfs_setxattr_locked().  This
fixes the above issue and has the added benefit of causing nfsd to
recall conflicting delegations on a file when a client tries to change

nfsd: ensure that nfsd4_fattr_args.context is zeroed out

If nfsd4_encode_fattr4 ends up doing a "goto out" before we get to
checking for the security label, then args.context will be set to
uninitialized junk on the stack, which we'll then try to free.
Initialize it early.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 05:36:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46698 | video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46698</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()

In aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently only
call sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to the
following problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:

1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display
2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so
   sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources
   are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device()
3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable()
4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources
   have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when
   it was called by the other device.

Fix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking
the device to determine if we should execute it or not.

v2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set
v3: Move device check into the mutex
    Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()
    Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 05:36:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46699 | drm/v3d: Disable preemption while updating GPU stats</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46699</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks.

An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked, i.e., the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45823 | FactoryTalk® Batch View™ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability via shared secrets</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45823</link><description>CVE-2024-45823 IMPACT
