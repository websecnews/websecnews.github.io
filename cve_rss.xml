An unsafe sanitization of dataset contents on the `MarkovData#getNext` method used in `Markov#generate` and `Markov#choose` allows a maliciously crafted string on the dataset to throw and stop the function from running properly. If a string contains a forbidden substring (i.e. `__proto__`) followed by a space character, the code will access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData` by removing the last character of the string, bypassing the dataset sanitization (as it is supposed to be already sanitized before this function is called). Any dataset can be contaminated with the substring making it unable to properly generate anything in some cases. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.5 and all users are advised to upgrade.

wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix crash in chip reset fail

In case of drv own fail in reset, we may need to run mac_reset several
times. The sequence would trigger system crash as the log below.

Because we do not re-enable/schedule "tx_napi" before disable it again,
the process would keep waiting for state change in napi_diable(). To
avoid the problem and keep status synchronize for each run, goto final
resource handling if drv own failed.

ice: Fix DMA mappings leak

Fix leak, when user changes ring parameters.
During reallocation of RX buffers, new DMA mappings are created for
those buffers. New buffers with different RX ring count should
substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in ice_vsi_cfg_rxq
and reallocated again with ice_alloc_rx_buf. kfree on rx_buf caused
leak of already mapped DMA.
Reallocate ZC with xdp_buf struct, when BPF program loads. Reallocate
back to rx_buf, when BPF program unloads.
If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate
RX queues accordingly in XDP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.

Steps for reproduction:
while :
do
	for ((i=0; i&lt;=8160; i=i+32))
	do
		ethtool -G enp130s0f0 rx $i tx $i
		sleep 0.5

vfio/type1: Unpin zero pages

There's currently a reference count leak on the zero page.  We increment
the reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), but the page is later handled
as an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's not accounted against the
user and not unpinned by our put_pfn().

Introducing special zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve the
leak, but without accounting of the zero page, a single user could
still create enough mappings to generate a reference count overflow.

The zero page is always resident, so for our purposes there's no reason
to keep it pinned.  Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned from
pin_user_pages_remote() and unpin any zero pages.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 15:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48701 | ALSA: usb-audio: Fix an out-of-bounds bug in __snd_usb_parse_audio_interface()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48701</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: emu10k1: Fix out of bounds access in snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc()

The voice allocator sometimes begins allocating from near the end of the
array and then wraps around, however snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc()
accesses the newly allocated voices as if it never wrapped around.

This results in out of bounds access if the first voice has a high enough
index so that first_voice + requested_voice_count &gt; NUM_G (64).
The more voices are requested, the more likely it is for this to occur.

This was initially discovered using PipeWire, however it can be reproduced
by calling aplay multiple times with 16 channels:
aplay -r 48000 -D plughw:CARD=Live,DEV=3 -c 16 /dev/zero

ipv6: sr: fix out-of-bounds read when setting HMAC data.

The SRv6 layer allows defining HMAC data that can later be used to sign IPv6
Segment Routing Headers. This configuration is realised via netlink through
four attributes: SEG6_ATTR_HMACKEYID, SEG6_ATTR_SECRET, SEG6_ATTR_SECRETLEN and
SEG6_ATTR_ALGID. Because the SECRETLEN attribute is decoupled from the actual
length of the SECRET attribute, it is possible to provide invalid combinations
(e.g., secret = "", secretlen = 64). This case is not checked in the code and
with an appropriately crafted netlink message, an out-of-bounds read of up
to 64 bytes (max secret length) can occur past the skb end pointer and into
skb_shared_info:

i40e: Fix kernel crash during module removal

The driver incorrectly frees client instance and subsequent
i40e module removal leads to kernel crash.

Reproducer:
1. Do ethtool offline test followed immediately by another one
host# ethtool -t eth0 offline; ethtool -t eth0 offline
2. Remove recursively irdma module that also removes i40e module
host# modprobe -r irdma

Two offline tests cause IRDMA driver failure (ETIMEDOUT) and this
failure is indicated back to i40e_client_subtask() that calls
i40e_client_del_instance() to free client instance referenced
by pf-&gt;cinst and sets this pointer to NULL. During the module
removal i40e_remove() calls i40e_lan_del_device() that dereferences
pf-&gt;cinst that is NULL -&gt; crash.
Do not remove client instance when client open callbacks fails and
just clear __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED bit. The driver also needs
to take care about this situation (when netdev is up and client
is NOT opened) in i40e_notify_client_of_netdev_close() and
calls client close callback only when __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED
is set.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 15:21:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48689 | tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48689</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status

We got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuse
of pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.

Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,
using page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give
false positives.

There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,
but not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,
removing cpu cycles.

Note to stable teams :

You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 ("net: introduce
__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc") as a prereq.

Race is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4
("mm: add a signature in struct page") because page_is_pfmemalloc()
is now using low order bit from page-&gt;lru.next, which can change
more often than page-&gt;index.

Low order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor
in LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.

Backporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.

erofs: fix pcluster use-after-free on UP platforms

During stress testing with CONFIG_SMP disabled, KASAN reports as below:

The root cause is that erofs_workgroup_unfreeze() doesn't reset to
orig_val thus it causes a race that the pcluster reuses unexpectedly
before freeing.

Since UP platforms are quite rare now, such path becomes unnecessary.
Let's drop such specific-designed path directly instead.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 14:59:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48675 | IB/core: Fix a nested dead lock as part of ODP flow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48675</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/core: Fix a nested dead lock as part of ODP flow

Fix a nested dead lock as part of ODP flow by using mmput_async().

From the below call trace [1] can see that calling mmput() once we have
the umem_odp-&gt;umem_mutex locked as required by
ib_umem_odp_map_dma_and_lock() might trigger in the same task the
exit_mmap()-&gt;__mmu_notifier_release()-&gt;mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() which
may dead lock when trying to lock the same mutex.

Moving to use mmput_async() will solve the problem as the above
exit_mmap() flow will be called in other task and will be executed once
the lock will be available.

In affected versions the capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the “requirements_path” parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. This issue has been addressed in version 2.214.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not override the “requirements_path” parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, and instead use the default value.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32986 | Arbitrary code execution due to improper sanitization of web app properties in PWAsForFirefox</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32986</link><description>PWAsForFirefox is a tool to install, manage and use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Mozilla Firefox. Due to improper sanitization of web app properties (such as name, description, shortcuts), web apps were able to inject additional lines into XDG Desktop Entries (on Linux) and `AppInfo.ini` (on PortableApps.com). This allowed malicious web apps to introduce keys like `Exec`, which could run arbitrary code when the affected web app was launched. This vulnerability affects all Linux and PortableApps.com users of all PWAsForFirefox versions up to (excluding) 2.12.0. Windows and macOS users are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in commit `9932d4b` which has been included in release in v2.12.0. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes. All Linux and PortableApps.com users are advised to update to this version as soon as possible. It is also recommended for Windows and macOS users to update to this version, as it contains additional fixes related to properties sanitization. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34062 | tqdm CLI arguments injection attack</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34062</link><description>tqdm is an open source progress bar for Python and CLI.

Versions 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 of vodozemac have degraded secret zeroization capabilities, due to changes in third-party cryptographic dependencies (the Dalek crates), which moved secret zeroization capabilities behind a feature flag and defaulted this feature to off. The degraded zeroization capabilities could result in the production of more memory copies of encryption secrets and secrets could linger in memory longer than necessary. This marginally increases the risk of sensitive data exposure. This issue has been addressed in version 0.6.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33914 | WordPress Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin &amp;lt;= 2.6.9.1 - Broken Access Control on Post Duplication vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33914</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Exclusive Addons Exclusive Addons Elementor.This issue affects Exclusive Addons Elementor: from n/a through 2.6.9.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33915 | WordPress Debug Log Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3.1 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33915</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Bowo Debug Log Manager.This issue affects Debug Log Manager: from n/a through 2.3.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33919 | WordPress RomethemeKit For Elementor plugin &amp;lt;= 1.4.1 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33919</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Rometheme RomethemeKit For Elementor.This issue affects RomethemeKit For Elementor: from n/a through 1.4.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33920 | WordPress Democracy Poll  plugin &amp;lt;= 6.0.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33920</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Kama Democracy Poll.This issue affects Democracy Poll: from n/a through 6.0.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33921 | WordPress ReviewX plugin &amp;lt;= 1.6.21 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33921</link><description>Broken Access Control vulnerability in ReviewX.This issue affects ReviewX: from n/a through 1.6.21.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:39:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33923 | WordPress SP Project &amp;amp; Document Manager plugin &amp;lt;= 4.69 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33923</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Smartypants SP Project &amp; Document Manager.This issue affects SP Project &amp; Document Manager : from n/a through 4.69.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33925 | WordPress Embed Google Fonts plugin &amp;lt;= 3.1.0 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33925</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Adrian Mörchen Embed Google Fonts.This issue affects Embed Google Fonts: from n/a through 3.1.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33929 | WordPress Directorist plugin &amp;lt;= 7.8.6 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33929</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in wpWax Directorist.This issue affects Directorist: from n/a through 7.8.6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33931 | WordPress JW Player for WordPress plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33931</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in ilGhera JW Player for WordPress.This issue affects JW Player for WordPress: from n/a through 2.3.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-33937 | WordPress Progressive WordPress (PWA) plugin &amp;lt;= 2.1.13 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33937</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Nico Martin Progressive WordPress (PWA).This issue affects Progressive WordPress (PWA): from n/a through 2.1.13.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-35701 | Apache Hive: Arbitrary command execution via JDBC driver</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35701</link><description>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive.

The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability. 

The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 08:29:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23912 | Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Merge DICOM Toolkit C/C++ on Windows.
