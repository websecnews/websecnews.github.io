Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Resolve TX timeout error in power save stress test

This fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on
btnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two HCI
commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.

Test procedure using bash script:

hciconfig hci0 up
//Enable Power Save feature
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00
while (true)
do
    hciconfig hci0 leadv
    sleep 2
    hciconfig hci0 noleadv
    sleep 2
done

Error log, after adding few more debug prints:
Bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0A 20 01 00
Bluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on, status=0
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00
Can't set advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110)
Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout

When the power save mechanism turns on UART break, and btnxpuart_tx_work()
is scheduled simultaneously, psdata-&gt;ps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE,
which prevents the psdata-&gt;work from being scheduled, which is responsible
to turn OFF UART break.

This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as
well as around ps_state read/write.
btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is
PS_STATE_SLEEP, it will first schedule psdata-&gt;work, and then it will
reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is
PS_STATE_AWAKE.

Tested above script for 50,000 iterations and TX timeout error was not
observed anymore.</description><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 14:40:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8756 | TDuckCloud tduck-platform manage preHandle improper authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8756</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in TDuckCloud tduck-platform up to 5.1 and classified as critical.

In versions 5.2.0 through 5.12.7, there is an Open Redirect vulnerability in the trailing slash redirection logic when handling paths with double slashes. This allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary external domains by crafting URLs such as https://mydomain.com//malicious-site.com/. This increases the risk of phishing and other social engineering attacks. This affects sites that use on-demand rendering (SSR) with the Node or Cloudflare adapters. It does not affect static sites, or sites deployed to Netlify or Vercel. This issue is fixed in version 5.12.8. To work around this issue at the network level, block outgoing redirect responses with a Location header value that starts with `//`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54886 | skops: Card.get_model does not block arbitrary code execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54886</link><description>skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops, joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54887 | jwe: Missing AES-GCM authentication tag validation in encrypted JWEs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54887</link><description>jwe is a Ruby implementation of the RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard. In versions 1.1.0 and below, authentication tags of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs. This puts users at risk because JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value, decrypted by observing parsing differences and the GCM internal GHASH key can be recovered. Users are affected by this vulnerability even if they do not use an AES-GCM encryption algorithm for their JWEs. As the GHASH key may have been leaked, users must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading. This issue is fixed in version 1.1.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8703 | Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System Environmental Real-Time Data Module GetAreaTrendChartData sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8703</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Wanzhou WOES Intelligent Optimization Energy Saving System 1.0.

In versions 0.8.5 and earlier, remote ZIP archives were handled in a streamwise fashion, and file entries were not reconciled against the archive's central directory. An attacker could contrive a ZIP archive that would extract with legitimate contents on some package installers, and malicious contents on others due to multiple local file entries. An attacker could  also contrive a "stacked" ZIP input with multiple internal ZIPs, which would be handled differently by different package installers. The attacker could choose which installer to target in both scenarios. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.6. To work around this issue, users may choose to set UV_INSECURE_NO_ZIP_VALIDATION=1 to revert to the previous behavior.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 02:21:39 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
