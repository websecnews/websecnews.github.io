Issue Summary:
Apache Kafka's implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802 [1].
Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message.
However, Kafka's SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation.

Impact:
This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly
discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3].
Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue.

How to Detect If You Are Impacted:
If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted.
To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted.

Fix Details:
The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802.

Affected Versions:
Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below.

Fixed Versions:
3.9.0
3.8.1
3.7.2

Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue.

Recommendations for Mitigation:
Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by:
- Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication:
Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception.
- Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms:
Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:41:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-34990 | A relative path traversal in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.0 through 8.6.5 and 8.5.0 through 8.5.4 allows attacker to execute unauthorized c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34990</link><description>A relative path traversal in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.0 through 8.6.5 and 8.5.0 through 8.5.4 allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specially crafted web requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48889 | An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiManager version...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48889</link><description>An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiManager version 7.6.0, version 7.4.4 and below, version 7.2.7 and below, version 7.0.12 and below, version 6.4.14 and below and FortiManager Cloud version 7.4.4 and below, version 7.2.7 to 7.2.1, version 7.0.12 to 7.0.1 may allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute unauthorized code via FGFM crafted requests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-50570 | A Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability [CWE-312] in FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 through 7.4.1, 7.2.0 through 7.2.6, 7.0.0 t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50570</link><description>A Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability [CWE-312] in FortiClientWindows 7.4.0 through 7.4.1, 7.2.0 through 7.2.6, 7.0.0 through 7.0.13 and FortiClientLinux 7.4.0 through 7.4.2, 7.2.0 through 7.2.7, 7.0.0 through 7.0.13 may permit a local authenticated user to retrieve VPN password via memory dump, due to JavaScript's garbage collector</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:59:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-49677 | WordPress Bootstrap Buttons plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49677</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in David Cramer Bootstrap Buttons allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Bootstrap Buttons: from n/a through 1.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51646 | WordPress Saoshyant Element plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2 -  Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51646</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saoshyant Saoshyant Element allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Saoshyant Element: from n/a through 1.2.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52485 | WordPress WP Menu Image plugin &amp;lt;= 2.2 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52485</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Yudiz Solutions Ltd.

RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback.

RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 04:47:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11254 | AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages &amp;lt;= 1.1.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11254</link><description>The AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the disqus_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input validation.

In affected versions LAM does not properly sanitize configuration values, that are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`. This allows setting arbitrary config values and thus effectively bypassing `mitigation` of CVE-2024-23333/GHSA-fm9w-7m7v-wxqv. Configuration values for the main config or server profiles are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`.
The values are written to `config.cfg` or `serverprofile.conf` in the format of `settingsName: settingsValue` line-by-line.
An attacker can smuggle arbitrary config values in a config file, by inserting a newline into certain config fields, followed by the value. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:53:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29646 | Buffer Overflow vulnerability in radarorg radare2 v.5.8.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the name, type, or group fields.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29646</link><description>Buffer Overflow vulnerability in radarorg radare2 v.5.8.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the name, type, or group fields.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31668 | rizin before v0.6.3 is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements via meta_set function in librz/analysis/meta.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31668</link><description>rizin before v0.6.3 is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements via meta_set function in librz/analysis/meta.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:46:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56142 | Path Traversal in pghoard</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56142</link><description>pghoard is a PostgreSQL backup daemon and restore tooling that stores backup data in cloud object stores.
