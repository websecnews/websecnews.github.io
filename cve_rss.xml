A vulnerability was discovered in the BeyondTrust provider implementation for External Secrets Operator versions 0.10.1 through 0.19.2. The provider previously retrieved Kubernetes secrets directly, without validating the namespace context or the type of secret store. This allowed unauthorized cross-namespace secret access, violating security boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive credentials. In version 0.20.0, the provider code was updated to use the `resolvers.SecretKeyRef` utility, which enforces namespace validation and only allows cross-namespace access for `ClusterSecretStore` types. This ensures secrets are only retrieved from the correct namespace, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix. As a workaround, use a policy engine such as Kyverno or OPA to prevent using BeyondTrust provider and/or validate the `(Cluster)SecretStore` and ensure the namespace may only be set when using a `ClusterSecretStore`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 22:30:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62162 | cel-rust May Panic During Parsing of Invalid CEL Expressions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62162</link><description>cel-rust is a Common Expression Language interpreter written in Rust.

A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 22:30:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61911 | python-ldap has sanitization bypass in ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61911</link><description>python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python. In versions prior to 3.4.5, the sanitization method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` can be tricked to skip escaping of special characters when a crafted `list` or `dict` is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter, and the non-default `escape_mode=1` is configured. The method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` supports 3 different escaping modes. `escape_mode=0` (default) and `escape_mode=2` happen to raise exceptions when a `list` or `dict` object is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter. However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value. If an application relies on the vulnerable method in the `python-ldap` library to escape untrusted user input, an attacker might be able to abuse the vulnerability to launch ldap injection attacks which could potentially disclose or manipulate ldap data meant to be inaccessible to them. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue by adding a type check at the start of the `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` method to raise an exception when the supplied `assertion_value` parameter is not of type `str`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 22:11:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61912 | python-ldap Vulnerable to Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output and Improper Null Termination</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61912</link><description>python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python.

Happy DOM v19 and lower contains a security vulnerability that puts the owner system at the risk of RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks. A Node.js VM Context is not an isolated environment, and if the user runs untrusted JavaScript code within the Happy DOM VM Context, it may escape the VM and get access to process level functionality. It seems like what the attacker can get control over depends on if the process is using ESM or CommonJS. With CommonJS the attacker can get hold of the `require()` function to import modules. Happy DOM has JavaScript evaluation enabled by default. This may not be obvious to the consumer of Happy DOM and can potentially put the user at risk if untrusted code is executed within the environment. Version 20.0.0 patches the issue by changing JavaScript evaluation to be disabled by default.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:48:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61925 | Astro&amp;#x27;s `X-Forwarded-Host` is reflected with no validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61925</link><description>Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.14.2, Astro reflects the value in `X-Forwarded-Host` in output when using `Astro.url` without any validation. It is common for web servers such as nginx to route requests via the `Host` header, and forward on other request headers. As such as malicious request can be sent with both a `Host` header and an `X-Forwarded-Host` header where the values do not match and the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is malicious. Astro will then return the malicious value. This could result in any usages of the `Astro.url` value in code being manipulated by a request. For example if a user follows guidance and uses `Astro.url` for a canonical link the canonical link can be manipulated to another site. It is theoretically possible that the value could also be used as a login/registration or other form URL as well, resulting in potential redirecting of login credentials to a malicious party. As this is a per-request attack vector the surface area would only be to the malicious user until one considers that having a caching proxy is a common setup, in which case any page which is cached could persist the malicious value for subsequent users. Many other frameworks have an allowlist of domains to validate against, or do not have a case where the headers are reflected to avoid such issues. This could affect anyone using Astro in an on-demand/dynamic rendering mode behind a caching proxy. Version 5.14.2 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61921 | Sinatra has ReDoS vulnerability in ETag header value generation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61921</link><description>Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in Ruby.

Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, `Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to Rack version 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, anu of which enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`, preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies. Additionally, enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`).</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:28:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61920 | Authlib is vulnerable to Denial of Service via Oversized JOSE Segments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61920</link><description>Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded JWS/JWT header and signature segments. A remote attacker can craft a token whose base64url‑encoded header or signature spans hundreds of megabytes. During verification, Authlib decodes and parses the full input before it is rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption to hostile levels and enabling denial of service. Version 1.6.5 patches the issue. Some temporary workarounds are available. Enforce input size limits before handing tokens to Authlib and/or use application-level throttling to reduce amplification risk.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:28:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62245 | Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.4.1 through 7.4.3.112, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.5, 2023...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62245</link><description>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.4.1 through 7.4.3.112, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.5, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.10, and 7.4 GA through update 92 allows remote attackers to add and edit publication comments.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:22:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11581 | PowerJob OpenAPIController runJob authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11581</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in PowerJob up to 5.1.2.

Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions. When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a "redirect" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`. Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:19:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60269 | JEEWMS 20250820 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in the exportXls function located in the src/main/java/org/jeecgframework/web/cgreport/contro...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60269</link><description>JEEWMS 20250820 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in the exportXls function located in the src/main/java/org/jeecgframework/web/cgreport/controller/excel/CgExportExcelController.java file.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:58:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60308 | code-projects Simple Online Hotel Reservation System 1.0 has a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Add Room function of the onli...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60308</link><description>code-projects Simple Online Hotel Reservation System 1.0 has a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Add Room function of the online hotel reservation system.
