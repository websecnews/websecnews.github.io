The script reflects user input from the `jobid` parameter in its HTTP response without proper HTML encoding or sanitization. When a victim visits a specially crafted URL pointing to this endpoint, arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed in their browser context. The vulnerability occurs because the CGI script directly outputs the query string parameters into the HTML response without escaping HTML special characters.

The ZOO-Project Web Processing Service (WPS) Server contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in its EchoProcess service prior to commit 7a5ae1a. The vulnerability exists because the EchoProcess service directly reflects user input in its output without proper sanitization when handling complex inputs.The service accepts various input formats including XML, JSON, and SVG, and returns the content based on the requested MIME type. When processing SVG content and returning it with the image/svg+xml MIME type, the server fails to sanitize potentially malicious JavaScript in attributes like onload, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it exists in a service specifically designed to echo back user input, and the lack of proper sanitization in combination with SVG handling creates a reliable XSS vector.

This can lead to multiple security issues including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are '/v1/share/{id:str}' for uploading and '/v1/share/{id:str}' for downloading JSON files. The lack of authentication allows any user to upload and overwrite files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts, and accessing sensitive information.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 18:53:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13059 | Path Traversal in mintplex-labs/anything-llm</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13059</link><description>A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library.

A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:42:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1151 | GNU Binutils ld xmemdup.c xmemdup memory leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1151</link><description>A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43.

When IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring

accounting, the accounting can go wrong:
If uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory
counters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned
memory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of
uring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21687 | vfio/platform: check the bounds of read/write syscalls</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21687</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 ("drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion"), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport &gt; serial-&gt;num_ports) {
               dev_err(&amp;amp;port-&gt;dev,
                       "%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial-&gt;port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial-&gt;num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial-&gt;num_ports, the assignment of "port" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv-&gt;current_port = newport;
       port = serial-&gt;port[serial_priv-&gt;current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial-&gt;num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21690 | scsi: storvsc: Ratelimit warning logs to prevent VM denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21690</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachestat: fix page cache statistics permission checking

When the 'cachestat()' system call was added in commit cf264e1329fb
("cachestat: implement cachestat syscall"), it was meant to be a much
more convenient (and performant) version of mincore() that didn't need
mapping things into the user virtual address space in order to work.

But it ended up missing the "check for writability or ownership" fix for
mincore(), done in commit 134fca9063ad ("mm/mincore.c: make mincore()
more conservative").

This just adds equivalent logic to 'cachestat()', modified for the file

mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug

In zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the
current CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used
throughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,
it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.

If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,
we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx
are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. 
acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).

The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec ("mm/zswap: move to use
crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration") when the switch to the
crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was
retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the
CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the
crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.

Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating
and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure
that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the
compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after
acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new
CPU.

The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug
callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is
allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU
hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by
compression/decompression.

Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This
would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already
holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a
deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but
Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug
notifiers [2].

Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:
- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in
  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in
  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the
  CPU is onlined.
- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but
  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could
  result in subtle performance issues.

Starting in version 0.3.2 and prior to versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, and 0.5.6, there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion in `net-imap`'s response parser.  At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send  can send highly compressed `uid-set` data which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to convert the `uid-set` data into arrays of integers, with no limitation on the expanded size of the ranges. Versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, 0.5.6, and higher fix this issue. Additional details for proper configuration of fixed versions and backward compatibility are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:26:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24032 | PAM-PKCS#11 vulnerable to authentication bypass with default value for `cert_policy` (`none`)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24032</link><description>PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24892 | OpenProject stored HTML injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24892</link><description>OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software.

In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:47:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-11831 | Npm-serialize-javascript: cross-site scripting (xss) in serialize-javascript</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11831</link><description>A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript.

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()

The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt
disabled section:

irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
  irq_get_desc_lock()
     raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   &lt;--- Disable interrupts
  its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
     guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   &lt;--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()
  irq_put_desc_unlock()        &lt;--- Warns because interrupts are enabled

This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original
raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).

Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).

platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race

The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev-&gt;ops is valid when
SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
devm_serdev_device_open().

Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()
calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 11:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13440 | Super Store Finder &amp;lt;= 7.0 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection to Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13440</link><description>The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘ssf_wp_user_name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into an already existing query to store cross-site scripting in store reviews.</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 04:31:54 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
