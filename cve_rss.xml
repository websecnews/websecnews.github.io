In cases of MONGODB-X509, which is not enabled by default, this may lead to improper authentication. This issue may also affect intra-cluster authentication. This issue affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.31, MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.20, MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.16 and MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.4.
Required Configuration : MongoDB Server must be running on Linux Operating Systems and CRL revocation status checking must be enabled</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:32:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30177 | Apache Camel: Camel-Undertow Message Header Injection via Improper Filtering</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30177</link><description>Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel in Camel-Undertow component under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.3, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.

Camel undertow component is vulnerable to Camel message header injection, in particular the custom header filter strategy used by the component only filter the "out" direction, while it doesn't filter the "in" direction.


This allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviour such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:32:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13553 | SMS Alert Order Notifications – WooCommerce &amp;lt;= 3.7.9 - Unauthenticated Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13553</link><description>The SMS Alert Order Notifications – WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.9.

keys: Fix UAF in key_put()

Once a key's reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collector
thread may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touch
the key after that point.  The most key_put() is normally allowed to do is
to touch key_gc_work as that's a static global variable.

However, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now
done in key_put() once the key's usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code
is looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.

Fix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc'd now rather than
looking at the key's refcount in the garbage collector.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:52:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31124 | Zitadel  allows User Enumeration by loginname attribute normalization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31124</link><description>Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called "Ignoring unknown usernames" which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesn't exist and report "Username or Password invalid". While the setting was correctly respected during the login flow, the user's username was normalized leading to a disclosure of the user's existence. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.6, 2.70.8, 2.69.9, 2.68.9, 2.67.13, 2.66.16, 2.65.7, 2.64.6, and 2.63.9.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31123 | Zitadel Expired JWT Keys Usable for Authorization Grants</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31123</link><description>Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software.

Prior to 2.3.6, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Beego's RenderForm() function due to improper HTML escaping of user-controlled data. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or account takeover. The vulnerability affects any application using Beego's RenderForm() function with user-provided data. Since it is a high-level function generating an entire form markup, many developers would assume it automatically escapes attributes (the way most frameworks do). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.6.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:42:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30149 | OpenEMR Reflected XSS in AJAX Script</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30149</link><description>OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application.

Thus, an attacker can conduct active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH connections if Dropbear is enabled as the SSH daemon. I n VyOS, this is not the default configuration for the system SSH daemon, but is for the console service. To mitigate this, one can run "rm -f /etc/dropbear/*key*" and/or "rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key*" and then dropbearkey -t rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5.

If a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious web page, arbitrary Java Script may be executed with this user's permissions. This can lead to information loss and/or modification of existing data.
The issues are caused by a  bug https://github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-security/issues/610  in the widely used nuxt-security module.





There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub:





  *  1.13.3 or later
