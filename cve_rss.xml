Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving all of the above attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.13, 1.14.9, and 1.15.3.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:40:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2990 | Tenda FH1203 execCommand formexeCommand stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2990</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Tenda FH1203 2.0.1.6.

A vulnerability has been discovered in Pihole that allows an authenticated user on the platform to read internal server files arbitrarily, and because the application runs from behind, reading files is done as a privileged user.If the URL that is in the list of "Adslists" begins with "file*" it is understood that it is updating from a local file, on the other hand if it does not begin with "file*" depending on the state of the response it does one thing or another. The problem resides in the update through local files. When updating from a file which contains non-domain lines, 5 of the non-domain lines are printed on the screen, so if you provide it with any file on the server which contains non-domain lines it will print them on the screen. This vulnerability is fixed by 5.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:26:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23451 | Elasticsearch Incorrect Authorization in the Remote Cluster Security API key based security model</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23451</link><description>Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch 8.10.0 and before 8.13.0.

Specifically, when the Vert.x HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak. The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby accelerating the memory leak.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 08:12:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2004 | Usage of disabled protocol</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2004</link><description>When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly disabled.      curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se  The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations.

drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before executing GPINT commands

[Why]
DMCUB can be in idle when we attempt to interface with the HW through
the GPINT mailbox resulting in a system hang.

[How]
Add dc_wake_and_execute_gpint() to wrap the wake, execute, sleep
sequence.

If the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB will be put back into
sleep after the optional response is returned.

It functions similar to the inbox command interface.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52625 | drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52625</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface

[Why]
We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
powered on.

[How]
We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,
but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.

Fixing this issue involves the following:

1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start
   the process to exit idle or notify idle.

It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without
driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver
allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one
of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.

2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper
   that maintains this SW state.

This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the
DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit
idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.

3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or
   waiting for DMCUB idle.

This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping
DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52626 | net/mlx5e: Fix operation precedence bug in port timestamping napi_poll context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52626</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events

AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with
the ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying
user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit
registers or above the values set in high limit registers.
However, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callback
functions must be implemented and those were not present until now.
The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the
proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel
because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.

Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write
event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.

Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also move
those from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused
when support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26646 | thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26646</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM

The kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to the
hardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occurs
during boot and remains constant throughout runtime.

When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a second
memory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location as
part of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer may
differ from the one allocated by the image kernel.

When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFI
buffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if the
hardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from the
restore kernel).

It is also possible that the hardware "forgets" the address of the memory
buffer when resuming from "deep" suspend. Memory corruption may also occur
in such a scenario.

To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to
suspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.

Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of
non-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the
boot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during "deep" suspend
and hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.

platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe

p2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It
guards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel
rescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock
when PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan
locks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices
call p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.
Hence the deadlock.

To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().
Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()
for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),
refer the cache and return to the caller.

Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check
that its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH
specifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices
at the same DEVFN.

==================================================================

This is because flexbg_size is too large and the size of the new_group_data
array to be allocated exceeds MAX_ORDER. Currently, the minimum value of
MAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the corresponding
maximum number of groups that can be allocated is:

 (PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) ≈ 21845

And the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,
this value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups added
each time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multiple
times to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadata
in a flex_bg may be more dispersed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:22:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52623 | SUNRPC: Fix a suspicious RCU usage warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52623</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 16:57:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2893 | Tenda AC7 SetOnlineDevName formSetDeviceName stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2893</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda AC7 15.03.06.44 and classified as critical.

This happens because create_pending_snapshot() initializes the new root
item as a copy of the source root item. This includes the refs field,
which is 0 for a deleted subvolume. The call to btrfs_insert_root()
therefore inserts a root with refs == 0. btrfs_get_new_fs_root() then
finds the root and returns -ENOENT if refs == 0, which causes
create_pending_snapshot() to abort.

Fix it by checking the source root's refs before attempting the
snapshot, but after locking subvol_sem to avoid racing with deletion.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 15:26:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26645 | tracing: Ensure visibility when inserting an element into tracing_map</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26645</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The problem appears to be caused by CPU reordering of writes issued from
__tracing_map_insert().

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry-&gt;val);
 if (val &amp;&amp; keys_match(key, val-&gt;key, map-&gt;key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt-&gt;key, key, map-&gt;key_size);
 entry-&gt;val = elt;

The "memcpy(elt-&gt;key, key, map-&gt;key_size);" and "entry-&gt;val = elt;"
stores may become visible in the reversed order on another CPU. This
second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val-&gt;key and subse

This vulnerability is fixed in 6.8.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 13:35:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29684 | DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /src/dede/makehtml_homepage.php allowing a remo...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29684</link><description>DedeCMS v5.7 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /src/dede/makehtml_homepage.php allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 13:28:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1933 | Improper symlink resolution in TeamViewer Remote client for macOS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1933</link><description>Insecure UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following in TeamViewer Remote Client prior Version 15.52 for macOS allows an attacker with unprivileged access, to potentially elevate privileges or conduct a denial-of-service-attack by overwriting the symlink.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 12:54:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52214 | WordPress Void Contact Form 7 Widget For Elementor Page Builder plugin &amp;lt;= 2.3 -

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 20:31:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2427 | Rockwell Automation - Denial-of-service and Input Validation Vulnerabilities in PowerFlex® 527</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2427</link><description>A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation PowerFlex® 527 due to improper traffic throttling in the device.

KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for "Unicode (sub|super)script characters" allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions, without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 19:53:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28243 | KaTeX&amp;#x27;s maxExpand bypassed by \edef</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28243</link><description>KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web.

tipc: skb_linearize the head skb when reassembling msgs

It's not a good idea to append the frag skb to a skb's frag_list if
the frag_list already has skbs from elsewhere, such as this skb was
created by pskb_copy() where the frag_list was cloned (all the skbs
in it were skb_get'ed) and shared by multiple skbs.

However, the new appended frag skb should have been only seen by the
current skb. Otherwise, it will cause use after free crashes as this
appended frag skb are seen by multiple skbs but it only got skb_get
called once.

The same thing happens with a skb updated by pskb_may_pull() with a
skb_cloned skb. Li Shuang has reported quite a few crashes caused
by this when doing testing over macvlan devices:

This patch is to fix it by linearizing the head skb if it has frag_list
set in tipc_buf_append(). Note that we choose to do this before calling
skb_unshare(), as __skb_linearize() will avoid skb_copy(). Also, we can
not just drop the frag_list either as the early time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 09:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47163 | tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47163</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done

On some host, a crash could be triggered simply by repeating these
commands several times:

  # modprobe tipc
  # tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1
  # rmmod tipc

When removing the TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed to
release in a work queue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock().
If the work queue is schedule to run after the TIPC module is removed,
kernel will crash as the work queue function cleanup_beareri() code no
longer exists when trying to invoke it.

To fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net to track
the numbers of work queues in schedule, and  wait and exit until all
work queues are done in tipc_exit_net().</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 09:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47164 | net/mlx5e: Fix null deref accessing lag dev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47164</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: rp2: use 'request_firmware' instead of 'request_firmware_nowait'

In 'rp2_probe', the driver registers 'rp2_uart_interrupt' then calls
'rp2_fw_cb' through 'request_firmware_nowait'. In 'rp2_fw_cb', if the
firmware don't exists, function just return without initializing ports
of 'rp2_card'. But now the interrupt handler function has been
registered, and when an interrupt comes, 'rp2_uart_interrupt' may access
those ports then causing NULL pointer dereference or other bugs.

Because the driver does some initialization work in 'rp2_fw_cb', in
order to make the driver ready to handle interrupts, 'request_firmware'
should be used instead of asynchronous 'request_firmware_nowait'.

USB: usbfs: Don't WARN about excessively large memory allocations

Syzbot found that the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to
submit a bulk transfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way too
large.  This isn't a bug in the kernel; it's merely an invalid request
from the user and the usbfs code does handle it correctly.

In theory the same thing can happen with async transfers, or with the
packet descriptor table for isochronous transfers.

To prevent the MM subsystem from complaining about these bad
allocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls
for these buffers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 09:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47171 | net: usb: fix memory leak in smsc75xx_bind</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47171</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Syzbot reported memory leak in smsc75xx_bind().
The problem was is non-freed memory in case of
errors after memory allocation.

iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers

Channel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or
it is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was
introduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering
of child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all
need to be there somewhere.

Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.
Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimal
option for backporting etc.

Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a larger
set that Jonathan then applied.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 09:21:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47173 | misc/uss720: fix memory leak in uss720_probe</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47173</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible code

The BUG message "BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]
code" was observed for TCMU devices with kernel config DEBUG_PREEMPT.

The message was observed when blktests block/005 was run on TCMU devices
with fileio backend or user:zbc backend [1]. The commit 1130b499b4a7
("scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper") triggered the
symptom. The commit modified work queue to handle commands and changed
'current-&gt;nr_cpu_allowed' at smp_processor_id() call.

The message was also observed at system shutdown when TCMU devices were not
cleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id() was called in SCSI host
work queue for abort handling, and triggered the BUG message. This symptom
was observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 ("scsi: target:
tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper").

To avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID with
raw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performance
improvement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.

NFSv4: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return()

Commit de144ff4234f changes _pnfs_return_layout() to call
pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return() passing NULL as the struct
pnfs_layout_range argument. Unfortunately,
pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return() doesn't check if we have a value here
before dereferencing it, causing an oops.

I'm able to hit this crash consistently when running connectathon basic

net: zero-initialize tc skb extension on allocation

Function skb_ext_add() doesn't initialize created skb extension with any
value and leaves it up to the user. However, since extension of type
TC_SKB_EXT originally contained only single value tc_skb_ext-&gt;chain its
users used to just assign the chain value without setting whole extension
memory to zero first. This assumption changed when TC_SKB_EXT extension was
extended with additional fields but not all users were updated to
initialize the new fields which leads to use of uninitialized memory
afterwards. UBSAN log:

net: lantiq: fix memory corruption in RX ring

In a situation where memory allocation or dma mapping fails, an
invalid address is programmed into the descriptor. This can lead
to memory corruption. If the memory allocation fails, DMA should
reuse the previous skb and mapping and drop the packet. This patch
also increments rx drop counter.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 09:21:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47138 | cxgb4: avoid accessing registers when clearing filters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47138</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Clear DMA ops when switching domain

Since commit 08a27c1c3ecf ("iommu: Add support to change default domain
of an iommu group") a user can switch a device between IOMMU and direct
DMA through sysfs. This doesn't work for AMD IOMMU at the moment because
dev-&gt;dma_ops is not cleared when switching from a DMA to an identity
IOMMU domain. The DMA layer thus attempts to use the dma-iommu ops on an
identity domain, causing an oops:

  # echo 0000:00:05.0 &gt; /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/unbind
  # echo identity &gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:05.0/iommu_group/type

i2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset

Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit
in a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an
interrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not
prepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt as
if it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case
of a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory
access.

This condition was reproduced several times by syzbot:
