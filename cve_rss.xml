Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 12:55:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5707 | The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all ve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5707</link><description>The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

It is susceptible to a vulnerability where multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active Directory Users. This flaw allows an attacker to disrupt AD DC services.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:59:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46847 | Denial of service in http digest authentication</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46847</link><description>Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service,  where a remote attacker can perform buffer overflow attack by writing up to 2 MB of arbitrary data to heap memory when Squid is configured to accept HTTP Digest Authentication.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:59:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46848 | Denial of service in ftp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46848</link><description>Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service,  where a remote attacker can perform DoS by sending ftp:// URLs in HTTP Request messages or constructing ftp:// URLs from FTP Native input.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:59:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4091 | Smb clients can truncate files with read-only permissions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4091</link><description>A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" is configured with "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes".
