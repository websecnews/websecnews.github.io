If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users). Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 5.2.6, 6.0.6 and 6.1.3.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 15:25:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6679 | witmy my-springsecurity-plus role sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6679</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in witmy my-springsecurity-plus up to 2024-07-04.

An attacker can obtain a TLS certificate from the Stork server and use it to connect to the Stork agent. Once this connection is established with the valid certificate, the attacker can send malicious commands to a monitored service (Kea or BIND 9), possibly resulting in confidential data loss and/or denial of service. It should be noted that this vulnerability is not related to BIND 9 or Kea directly, and only customers using the Stork management tool are potentially affected.
This issue affects Stork versions 0.15.0 through 1.15.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 15:07:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38535 | Suricata http2: oom from duplicate headers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38535</link><description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine.

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

To exploit this successfully, the attacker must have root-system privileges on the affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to an error in the software build process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the system&amp;rsquo;s configuration options to bypass some of the integrity checks that are performed during the booting process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to control the boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass of the requirement to run Cisco signed images or alter the security properties of the running system.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40412 | Tenda AX12 v1.0 v22.03.01.46 contains a stack overflow in the deviceList parameter of the sub_42E410 function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40412</link><description>Tenda AX12 v1.0 v22.03.01.46 contains a stack overflow in the deviceList parameter of the sub_42E410 function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 16:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40417 | A vulnerability was found in Tenda AX1806 1.0.0.1.

crypto: qat - Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC memory leak

Using completion_done to determine whether the caller has gone
away only works after a complete call.  Furthermore it's still
possible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion,
resulting in another potential UAF.

Fix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing
the memory safely.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:35:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39488 | arm64: asm-bug: Add .align 2 to the end of __BUG_ENTRY</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39488</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: asm-bug: Add .align 2 to the end of __BUG_ENTRY

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, we fail to add necessary padding bytes
to bug_table entries, and as a result the last entry in a bug table will
be ignored, potentially leading to an unexpected panic(). All prior
entries in the table will be handled correctly.

The arm64 ABI requires that struct fields of up to 8 bytes are
naturally-aligned, with padding added within a struct such that struct
are suitably aligned within arrays.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERPOSE=y, the layout of a bug_entry is:

	struct bug_entry {
		signed int      bug_addr_disp;	// 4 bytes
		signed int      file_disp;	// 4 bytes
		unsigned short  line;		// 2 bytes
		unsigned short  flags;		// 2 bytes
	}

... with 12 bytes total, requiring 4-byte alignment.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the layout of a bug_entry is:

	struct bug_entry {
		signed int      bug_addr_disp;	// 4 bytes
		unsigned short  flags;		// 2 bytes
		&lt; implicit padding &gt;		// 2 bytes
	}

... with 8 bytes total, with 6 bytes of data and 2 bytes of trailing
padding, requiring 4-byte alginment.

When we create a bug_entry in assembly, we align the start of the entry
to 4 bytes, which implicitly handles padding for any prior entries.
However, we do not align the end of the entry, and so when
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the final entry lacks the trailing padding
bytes.

For the main kernel image this is not a problem as find_bug() doesn't
depend on the trailing padding bytes when searching for entries:

	for (bug = __start___bug_table; bug &lt; __stop___bug_table; ++bug)
		if (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))
			return bug;

However for modules, module_bug_finalize() depends on the trailing
bytes when calculating the number of entries:

	mod-&gt;num_bugs = sechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry);

... and as the last bug_entry lacks the necessary padding bytes, this entry
will not be counted, e.g. in the case of a single entry:

	sechdrs[i].sh_size == 6
	sizeof(struct bug_entry) == 8;

	sechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry) == 0;

Consequently module_find_bug() will miss the last bug_entry when it does:

	for (i = 0; i &lt; mod-&gt;num_bugs; ++i, ++bug)
		if (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))
			goto out;

... which can lead to a kenrel panic due to an unhandled bug.

This can be demonstrated with the following module:

	static int __init buginit(void)
	{
		WARN(1, "hello\n");
		return 0;
	}

	static void __exit bugexit(void)
	{
	}

	module_init(buginit);
	module_exit(bugexit);
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

... which will trigger a kernel panic when loaded:

ipv6: sr: fix memleak in seg6_hmac_init_algo

seg6_hmac_init_algo returns without cleaning up the previous allocations
if one fails, so it's going to leak all that memory and the crypto tfms.

Update seg6_hmac_exit to only free the memory when allocated, so we can
reuse the code directly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39490 | ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39490</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core

The seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into a
packet, delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This function
uses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in
the sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header.
In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails, the
seg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff,
which will result in a memory leak.

This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d ("ipv6: sr: fix BUG due
to headroom too small after SRH push") and persists even after commit
7a3f5b0de364 ("netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane"),
where the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilter
hooks.

The proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring the
seg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event that
skb_cow_head() fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:24:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39491 | ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39491</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance

The cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so it
should be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call
to cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().

The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbind
callback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was
unbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp
instance.

It is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it
can return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn't
have any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure if
cs_dsp was initialized in the bind.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:24:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39492 | mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Fix pm_runtime_get_sync() warning in mbox shutdown</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39492</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Fix pm_runtime_get_sync() warning in mbox shutdown

The return value of pm_runtime_get_sync() in cmdq_mbox_shutdown()
will return 1 when pm runtime state is active, and we don't want to
get the warning message in this case.

So we change the return value &lt; 0 for WARN_ON().</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:24:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36450 | Cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in sysinfo.cgi of Webmin versions prior to 1.910.

In v1.5, PrivateBin introduced the YOURLS server-side proxy. The idea was to allow using the YOURLs URL shortener without running the YOURLs instance without authentication and/or exposing the authentication token to the public, allowing anyone to shorten any URL. With the proxy mechanism, anyone can shorten any URL pointing to the configured PrivateBin instance. The vulnerability allowed other URLs to be shortened, as long as they contain the PrivateBin instance, defeating the limit imposed by the proxy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 19:01:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38517 | Tencent RapidJSON include/rapidjson/reader.h GenericReader::ParseNumber() Function Template Exponent Parsing Integer Underflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38517</link><description>Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer underflow in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing JSON text from a stream.

Prior to 2.1.0, the cache driver `GetBlob()` allows read access to any blob without access control check. If a Zot `accessControl` policy allows users read access to some repositories but restricts read access to other repositories and `dedupe` is enabled (it is enabled by default), then an attacker who knows the name of an image and the digest of a blob (that they do not have read access to), they may maliciously read it via a second repository they do have read access to. 
 This attack is possible because [`ImageStore.CheckBlob()` calls `checkCacheBlob()`](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/pkg/storage/imagestore/imagestore.go#L1158-L1159) to find the blob a global cache by searching for the digest. If it is found, it is copied to the user requested repository with `copyBlob()`. The attack may be mitigated by configuring "dedupe": false in the "storage" settings. The vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 19:01:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50807 | A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Wearable Processor and Modems with versions Exynos 9110, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300 that...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50807</link><description>A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Wearable Processor and Modems with versions Exynos 9110, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300 that allows an out-of-bounds write in the heap in 2G (no auth).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40034 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userLevel_deal.php?mudi=del</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40034</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userLevel_deal.php?mudi=del</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40036 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userGroup_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;nohrefStr=cl...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40036</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userGroup_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;amp;nohrefStr=close</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40037 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userScore_deal.php?mudi=del</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40037</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userScore_deal.php?mudi=del</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40038 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userScore_deal.php?mudi=rev</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40038</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userScore_deal.php?mudi=rev</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40039 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userGroup_deal.php?mudi=del</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40039</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userGroup_deal.php?mudi=del</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:41:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50805 | A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, and Modems with versions Exynos 9820, Exynos 9825, Exynos 98...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50805</link><description>A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, and Modems with versions Exynos 9820, Exynos 9825, Exynos 980, Exynos 990, Exynos 850, Exynos 1080, Exynos 2100, Exynos 2200, Exynos 1280, Exynos 1380, Exynos 1330, Exynos 9110, Exynos W920, Exynos W930, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300 that allows an out-of-bounds write in the heap in 2G (no auth).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:28:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50806 | A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, and Modems with versions Exynos 9820, Exynos 9825, Exynos 98...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50806</link><description>A vulnerability was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, and Modems with versions Exynos 9820, Exynos 9825, Exynos 980, Exynos 990, Exynos 850 Exynos 1080, Exynos 2100, Exynos 2200, Exynos 1280, Exynos 1380 Exynos 1330, Exynos 9110, Exynos W920, Exynos W930, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300 that allows out-of-bounds access to a heap buffer in the SIM Proactive Command.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:28:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-40035 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userLevel_deal.php?mudi=add.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40035</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via /admin/userLevel_deal.php?mudi=add.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 18:28:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27183 | Extension -

The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.). The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 17:59:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38971 | vaeThink 1.0.2 is vulnerable to stored Cross

Docker Desktop  v4.29.0 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4290  fixes the issue on MacOS, Linux and Windows with Hyper-V backend.

As exploitation requires "Allow only extensions distributed through the Docker Marketplace" to be disabled, Docker Desktop  v4.31.0 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4310  additionally changes the default configuration to enable this setting by default.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 17:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20701 | SQL Server Native Client OLE DB

The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:48:03 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
