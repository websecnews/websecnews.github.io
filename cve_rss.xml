usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit

If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()
as length will wrap around ending up as some very
large value.

The driver will then proceed to parse the header
located at that position, which will either oops or
process some random value.

The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
since the introduction of the driver.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35167 | WordPress Envo&amp;#x27;s Elementor Templates &amp;amp; Widgets for WooCommerce plugin &amp;lt;=1.4.8 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35167</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in EnvoThemes Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Envo's Elementor Templates &amp; Widgets for WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.4.8.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35169 | WordPress All Bootstrap Blocks plugin &amp;lt;= 1.3.15 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35169</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in AREOI All Bootstrap Blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects All Bootstrap Blocks: from n/a through 1.3.15.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4067 | Regular Expression Denial of Service in micromatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4067</link><description>The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4068 | Memory Exhaustion in braces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4068</link><description>The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user sends "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35170 | WordPress Sticky banner plugin &amp;lt;= 1.2.0 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35170</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Hidden Depth Sticky banner allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Sticky banner: from n/a through 1.2.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4747 | WordPress Propovoice CRM plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.6.2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4747</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Propovoice Propovoice CRM allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Propovoice CRM: from n/a through 1.7.6.2.</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 10:21:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4813 | Ruijie RG-UAC interface_commit.php os command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4813</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Ruijie RG-UAC up to 20240506.
