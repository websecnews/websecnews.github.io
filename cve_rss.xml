Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:50:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32956 | ManageWiki has SQL injection vulnerability in NamespaceMigrationJob</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32956</link><description>ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis.

In versions prior to 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a /../ in its path, itâ€™s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.</description><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:44:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32793 | Cilium packets from terminating endpoints may not be encrypted in Wireguard-enabled clusters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32793</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
