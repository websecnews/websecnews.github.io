Versions prior to 1.0.2-0.20260215211005-727213631ce6 fail to validate destination URLs for webhooks, allowing an attacker posing as an authenticated "Application Admin" to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal destinations. This could compromise the underlying cloud infrastructure or internal corporate network where the service is hosted. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.2-0.20260215211005-727213631ce6.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26963 | Cilium may not enforce host firewall policies when Native Routing, WireGuard and Node Encryption are enabled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26963</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

Versions 0.9.26020 and below fail to validate the integrity or authenticity of the ADB binary path specified in the ManualAdbPath setting before executing it, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious App.txt settings file that points ManualAdbPath to an arbitrary executable, then convincing a victim to launch the application with a command-line argument directing it to the malicious configuration directory. This vulnerability could be leveraged through social engineering tactics, such as distributing a shortcut bundled with a crafted settings file in an archive, resulting in RCE upon application startup. Thus issue has been fixed in version 0.9.26021.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27004 | OpenClaw session tool visibility hardening and Telegram webhook secret fallback</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27004</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, in some shared-agent deployments, OpenClaw session tools (`sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`) allowed broader session targeting than some operators intended. This is primarily a configuration/visibility-scoping issue in multi-user environments where peers are not equally trusted. In Telegram webhook mode, monitor startup also did not fall back to per-account `webhookSecret` when only the account-level secret was configured. In shared-agent, multi-user, less-trusted environments: session-tool access could expose transcript content across peer sessions. In single-agent or trusted environments, practical impact is limited. In Telegram webhook mode, account-level secret wiring could be missed unless an explicit monitor webhook secret override was provided. Version 2026.2.15 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27007 | OpenClaw&amp;#x27;s sandbox config hash sorted primitive arrays and suppressed needed container recreation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27007</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, `normalizeForHash` in `src/agents/sandbox/config-hash.ts` recursively sorted arrays that contained only primitive values. This made order-sensitive sandbox configuration arrays hash to the same value even when order changed. In OpenClaw sandbox flows, this hash is used to decide whether existing sandbox containers should be recreated. As a result, order-only config changes (for example Docker `dns` and `binds` array order) could be treated as unchanged and stale containers could be reused. This is a configuration integrity issue affecting sandbox recreation behavior. Starting in version 2026.2.15, array ordering is preserved during hash normalization; only object key ordering remains normalized for deterministic hashing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27008 | OpenClaw hardened the skill download target directory validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27008</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, a bug in `download` skill installation allowed `targetDir` values from skill frontmatter to resolve outside the per-skill tools directory if not strictly validated.

Prior to version 2026.2.14, authenticated attackers can read arbitrary files from the Gateway host by supplying absolute paths or path traversal sequences to the browser tool's `upload` action. The server passed these paths to Playwright's `setInputFiles()` APIs without restricting them to a safe root. An attacker must reach the Gateway HTTP surface (or otherwise invoke the same browser control hook endpoints); present valid Gateway auth (bearer token / password), as required by the Gateway configuration (In common default setups, the Gateway binds to loopback and the onboarding wizard generates a gateway token even for loopback); and have the `browser` tool permitted by tool policy for the target session/context (and have browser support enabled). If an operator exposes the Gateway beyond loopback (LAN/tailnet/custom bind, reverse proxy, tunnels, etc.), the impact increases accordingly. Starting in version 2026.2.14, the upload paths are now confined to OpenClaw's temp uploads root (`DEFAULT_UPLOAD_DIR`) and traversal/escape paths are rejected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26972 | OpenClaw has a Path Traversal in Browser Download Functionality</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26972</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. In versions 2026.1.12 through 2026.2.12, OpenClaw browser download helpers accepted an unsanitized output path. When invoked via the browser control gateway routes, this allowed path traversal to write downloads outside the intended OpenClaw temp downloads directory. This issue is not exposed via the AI agent tool schema (no `download` action). Exploitation requires authenticated CLI access or an authenticated gateway RPC token. Version 2026.2.13 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27001 | OpenClaw: Unsanitized CWD path injection into LLM prompts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27001</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, OpenClaw embedded the current working directory (workspace path) into the agent system prompt without sanitization. If an attacker can cause OpenClaw to run inside a directory whose name contains control/format characters (for example newlines or Unicode bidi/zero-width markers), those characters could break the prompt structure and inject attacker-controlled instructions. Starting in version 2026.2.15, the workspace path is sanitized before it is embedded into any LLM prompt output, stripping Unicode control/format characters and explicit line/paragraph separators. Workspace path resolution also applies the same sanitization as defense-in-depth.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27002 | OpenClaw: Docker container escape via unvalidated bind mount config injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27002</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, a configuration injection issue in the Docker tool sandbox could allow dangerous Docker options (bind mounts, host networking, unconfined profiles) to be applied, enabling container escape or host data access. OpenClaw 2026.2.15 blocks dangerous sandbox Docker settings and includes runtime enforcement when building `docker create` args; config-schema validation for `network=host`, `seccompProfile=unconfined`, `apparmorProfile=unconfined`; and security audit findings to surface dangerous sandbox docker config. As a workaround, do not configure `agents.*.sandbox.docker.binds` to mount system directories or Docker socket paths, keep `agents.*.sandbox.docker.network` at `none` (default) or `bridge`, and do not use `unconfined` for seccomp/AppArmor profiles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27003 | OpenClaw: Telegram bot token exposure via logs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27003</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Telegram bot tokens can appear in error messages and stack traces (for example, when request URLs include `https://api.telegram.org/bot/...`). Prior to version 2026.2.15, OpenClaw logged these strings without redaction, which could leak the bot token into logs, crash reports, CI output, or support bundles. Disclosure of a Telegram bot token allows an attacker to impersonate the bot and take over Bot API access. Users should upgrade to version 2026.2.15 to obtain a fix and rotate the Telegram bot token if it may have been exposed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2350 | Tanium addressed an insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in Interact and TDS.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2350</link><description>Tanium addressed an insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in Interact and TDS.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2408 | Use-after-free in Cloud Workloads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2408</link><description>Tanium addressed a use-after-free vulnerability in the Cloud Workloads Enforce client extension.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2435 | ASSET-7706</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2435</link><description>Tanium addressed a SQL injection vulnerability in Asset.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2605 | Tanium addressed an insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in TanOS.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2605</link><description>Tanium addressed an insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in TanOS.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:41:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26324 | OpenClaw has a SSRF guard bypass via full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 (loopback / metadata reachable)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26324</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, OpenClaw's SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata) to pass the SSRF guard.

Prior to version 2026.2.14, a mismatch between `rawCommand` and `command[]` in the node host `system.run` handler could cause allowlist/approval evaluation to be performed on one command while executing a different argv. This only impacts deployments that use the node host / companion node execution path (`system.run` on a node), enable allowlist-based exec policy (`security=allowlist`) with approval prompting driven by allowlist misses (for example `ask=on-miss`), allow an attacker to invoke `system.run`. Default/non-node configurations are not affected. Version 2026.2.14 enforces `rawCommand`/`command[]` consistency (gateway fail-fast + node host validation).</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26326 | OpenClaw skills.status could leak secrets to operator.read clients</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26326</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, `skills.status` could disclose secrets to `operator.read` clients by returning raw resolved config values in `configChecks` for skill `requires.config` paths. Version 2026.2.14 stops including raw resolved config values in requirement checks (return only `{ path, satisfied }`) and narrows the Discord skill requirement to the token key. In addition to upgrading, users should rotate any Discord tokens that may have been exposed to read-scoped clients.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26327 | OpenClaw allows unauthenticated discovery TXT records to steer routing and TLS pinning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26327</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are unauthenticated. Prior to version 2026.2.14, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs. iOS and macOS used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL. iOS and Android allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin. On a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection. As of time of publication, the iOS and Android apps are alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN. Version 2026.2.14 fixes the issue. Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints. Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins. In iOS/Android, first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU) and discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only. In Android, hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26953 | Pi-hole Web Interface has Stored HTML Injection via X-Forwarded-For Header in Active Sessions Table</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26953</link><description>Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad and internet tracker blocking application.  Versions 6.0 and above have a Stored HTML Injection vulnerability in the active sessions table located on the API settings page, allowing an attacker with valid credentials to inject arbitrary HTML code that will be rendered in the browser of any administrator who visits the active sessions page. The rowCallback function contains the value data.x_forwarded_for, which is directly concatenated into an HTML string and inserted into the DOM using jQuery’s .html() method. This method interprets the content as HTML, which means that any HTML tags present in the value will be parsed and rendered by the browser. An attacker can use common tools such as curl, wget, Python requests, Burp Suite, or even JavaScript fetch() to send an authentication request with an X-Forwarded-For header that contains malicious HTML code instead of a legitimate IP address. Since Pi-hole implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited to pure HTML injection without the ability to execute scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 6.4.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26958 | filippo.io/edwards25519 MultiScalarMult function produces invalid results or undefined behavior if receiver is not the identity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26958</link><description>filippo.io/edwards25519 is a Go library implementing the edwards25519 elliptic curve with APIs for building cryptographic primitives. In versions 1.1.0 and earlier, MultiScalarMult produces invalid results or undefined behavior if the receiver is not the identity point. If (*Point).MultiScalarMult is called on an initialized point that is not the identity point, it returns an incorrect result. If the method is called on an uninitialized point, the behavior is undefined. In particular, if the receiver is the zero value, MultiScalarMult returns an invalid point that compares Equal to every other point. Note that MultiScalarMult is a rarely used, advanced API. For example, users who depend on filippo.io/edwards25519 only through github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql are not affected. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13671 | Cross Site request forgery vulnerability discovered in OpenText WSM Management Server.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13671</link><description>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in OpenText™ Web Site Management Server allows Cross Site Request Forgery.

Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly). In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible. Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Disallowed protocols, credentials, query/hash, and non-root paths are rejected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26323 | OpenClaw has a command injection in maintainer clawtributors updater</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26323</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Versions 2026.1.8 through 2026.2.13 have a command injection in the maintainer/dev script `scripts/update-clawtributors.ts`. The issue affects contributors/maintainers (or CI) who run `bun scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` in a source checkout that contains a malicious commit author email (e.g. crafted `@users[.]noreply[.]github[.]com` values). Normal CLI usage is not affected (`npm i -g openclaw`): this script is not part of the shipped CLI and is not executed during routine operation. The script derived a GitHub login from `git log` author metadata and interpolated it into a shell command (via `execSync`). A malicious commit record could inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary commands when the script is run. Version 2026.2.14 contains a patch.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26952 | Pi-hole Web Interface has Stored HTML Injection via Local DNS Records (CNAME/Hosts) in data-tag Attribute</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26952</link><description>Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad and internet tracker blocking application. Versions 6.4 and below are vulnerable to stored HTML injection through the local DNS records configuration page, which allows an authenticated administrator to inject code that is stored in the Pi-hole configuration and rendered every time the DNS records table is viewed. The populateDataTable() function contains a data variable with the full DNS record value exactly as entered by the user and returned by the API. This value is inserted directly into the data-tag HTML attribute without any escaping or sanitization of special characters. When an attacker supplies a value containing double quotes ("), they can prematurely “close” the data-tag attribute and inject additional HTML attributes into the element. Since Pi-hole implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited.

In versions 3.0.4 and below, an issuing certificate with a validity that expires before the leaf certificate will be considered valid during verification even if the provided timestamp would mean the issuing certificate should be considered expired. When verifying artifact signatures using a certificate, Cosign first verifies the certificate chain using the leaf certificate's "not before" timestamp and later checks expiry of the leaf certificate using either a signed timestamp provided by the Rekor transparency log or from a timestamp authority, or using the current time. The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during the leaf certificate's validity. There is no impact to users of the public Sigstore infrastructure. This may affect private deployments with customized PKIs. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26320 | OpenClaw macOS deep link confirmation truncation can conceal executed agent message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26320</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. OpenClaw macOS desktop client registers the `openclaw://` URL scheme. For `openclaw://agent` deep links without an unattended `key`, the app shows a confirmation dialog that previously displayed only the first 240 characters of the message, but executed the full message after the user clicked "Run." At the time of writing, the OpenClaw macOS desktop client is still in beta. In versions 2026.2.6 through 2026.2.13, an attacker could pad the message with whitespace to push a malicious payload outside the visible preview, increasing the chance a user approves a different message than the one that is actually executed. If a user runs the deep link, the agent may perform actions that can lead to arbitrary command execution depending on the user's configured tool approvals/allowlists. This is a social-engineering mediated vulnerability: the confirmation prompt could be made to misrepresent the executed message. The issue is fixed in 2026.2.14. Other mitigations include not approve unexpected "Run OpenClaw agent?" prompts triggered while browsing untrusted sites and usingunattended deep links only with a valid `key` for trusted personal automations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26321 | OpenClaw has a local file disclosure via sendMediaFeishu in Feishu extension</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26321</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Feishu extension previously allowed `sendMediaFeishu` to treat attacker-controlled `mediaUrl` values as local filesystem paths and read them directly. If an attacker can influence tool calls (directly or via prompt injection), they may be able to exfiltrate local files by supplying paths such as `/etc/passwd` as `mediaUrl`. Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive a fix. The fix removes direct local file reads from this path and routes media loading through hardened helpers that enforce local-root restrictions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21535 | Microsoft Teams Information Disclosure Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-21535</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26319 | OpenClaw has Missing Webhook Authentication in Telnyx Provider Allowing Unauthenticated Requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26319</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Versions 2026.2.13 and below allow the optional @openclaw/voice-call plugin Telnyx webhook handler to accept unsigned inbound webhook requests when telnyx.publicKey is not configured, enabling unauthenticated callers to forge Telnyx events. Telnyx webhooks are expected to be authenticated via Ed25519 signature verification. In affected versions, TelnyxProvider.verifyWebhook() could effectively fail open when no Telnyx public key was configured, allowing arbitrary HTTP POST requests to the voice-call webhook endpoint to be treated as legitimate Telnyx events. This only impacts deployments where the Voice Call plugin is installed, enabled, and the webhook endpoint is reachable from the attacker (for example, publicly exposed via a tunnel/proxy). The issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.14.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26275 | httpsig-hyper has Improper Digest Verification that May Allow Message Integrity Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26275</link><description>httpsig-hyper is a hyper extension for http message signatures. An issue was discovered in `httpsig-hyper` prior to version 0.0.23 where Digest header verification could incorrectly succeed due to misuse of Rust's `matches!` macro. Specifically, the comparison `if matches!(digest, _expected_digest)` treated `_expected_digest` as a pattern binding rather than a value comparison, resulting in unconditional success of the match expression. As a consequence, digest verification could incorrectly return success even when the computed digest did not match the expected value. Applications relying on Digest verification as part of HTTP message signature validation may therefore fail to detect message body modification. The severity depends on how the library is integrated and whether additional signature validation layers are enforced. This issue has been fixed in `httpsig-hyper` 0.0.23. The fix replaces the incorrect `matches!` usage with proper value comparison and additionally introduces constant-time comparison for digest verification as defense-in-depth. Regression tests have also been added to prevent reintroduction of this issue. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to the patched version. There is no reliable workaround without upgrading. Users who cannot immediately upgrade should avoid relying solely on Digest verification for message integrity and ensure that full HTTP message signature verification is enforced at the application layer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:00:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26316 | OpenClaw has BlueBubbles webhook auth bypass via loopback proxy trust</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26316</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to 2026.2.13, the optional BlueBubbles iMessage channel plugin could accept webhook requests as authenticated based only on the TCP peer address being loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`) even when the configured webhook secret was missing or incorrect. This does not affect the default iMessage integration unless BlueBubbles is installed and enabled. Version 2026.2.13 contains a patch. Other mitigations include setting a non-empty BlueBubbles webhook password and avoiding deployments where a public-facing reverse proxy forwards to a loopback-bound Gateway without strong upstream authentication.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:00:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26317 | OpenClaw affected by cross-site request forgery (CSRF) through loopback browser mutation endpoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26317</link><description>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to 2026.2.14, browser-facing localhost mutation routes accepted cross-origin browser requests without explicit Origin/Referer validation. Loopback binding reduces remote exposure but does not prevent browser-initiated requests from malicious origins. A malicious website can trigger unauthorized state changes against a victim's local OpenClaw browser control plane (for example opening tabs, starting/stopping the browser, mutating storage/cookies) if the browser control service is reachable on loopback in the victim's browser context. Starting in version 2026.2.14, mutating HTTP methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are rejected when the request indicates a non-loopback Origin/Referer (or `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`). Other mitigations include enabling browser control auth (token/password) and avoid running with auth disabled.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:00:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-26314 | Go Ethereum affected by DoS via malicious p2p message</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26314</link><description>go-ethereum (geth) is a golang execution layer implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

Versions 0.13.4 and below have an access control bypass vulnerability which allows any repository collaborator with Write permissions to delete protected branches (including the default branch) by sending a direct POST request, completely bypassing the branch protection mechanism. This vulnerability in the DeleteBranchPost function eenables privilege escalation from Write to Admin level, allowing low-privilege users to perform dangerous operations that should be restricted to administrators only. Although Git Hook layer correctly prevents protected branch deletion via SSH push, the web interface deletion operation does not trigger Git Hooks, resulting in complete bypass of protection mechanisms. In oder to exploit this vulnerability, attackers must have write permissions to the target repository, protected branches configured to the target repository and access to the Gogs web interface. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25242 | Gogs allows unauthenticated file uploads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25242</link><description>Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service.

If an attacker can reach the webhook endpoint, they may be able to send forged updates that are processed as if they came from Telegram. Depending on enabled commands/tools and configuration, this could lead to unintended bot actions. Note: Telegram webhook mode is not enabled by default. It is enabled only when `channels.telegram.webhookUrl` is configured.

It fails to properly authenticate clients over the XPC protocol and does not correctly enforce macOS’s authorization model, exposing privileged functionality to untrusted users. Although it invokes the AuthorizationCopyRights API, it does so using overly permissive custom rights that it registers in the system’s authorization database (/var/db/auth.db).


These rights can be requested and granted by the authorization daemon to any local user, regardless of privilege level. As a result, an attacker can exploit the vulnerable service to perform privileged operations such as executing arbitrary commands or installing system components without requiring administrative credentials.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:43:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-25120 | Gogs Allows Cross-Repository Comment Deletion via DeleteComment</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-25120</link><description>Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service.

The $param variable from user input is interpolated into a command string within double quotes without sanitization via escapeshellarg(). The command is inserted into a database queue by safe_exec(), which performs no sanitization. The cycle_execs.php script, which is web-accessible without authentication, retrieves queued commands and passes them directly to exec(). An attacker can exploit a race condition by first triggering cycle_execs.php (which purges the queue and enters a polling loop), then injecting a malicious command via the rc endpoint while the worker is polling. The injected shell metacharacters expand inside double quotes, achieving remote code execution within one second.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 21:48:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27176 | MajorDoMo Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in command.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27176</link><description>MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in command.php.

User-supplied property values are stored raw in the database without sanitization. When an administrator views the property editor in the admin panel, the stored values are rendered without escaping in both a paragraph tag (SOURCE field) and a textarea element (VALUE field). The XSS fires on page load without requiring any click from the admin. Additionally, the session cookie lacks the HttpOnly flag, enabling session hijack via document.cookie exfiltration. An attacker can enumerate properties via the unauthenticated /api.php/data/ endpoint and poison any property with malicious JavaScript.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 21:49:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27178 | MajorDoMo Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Method Parameters to Shoutbox</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27178</link><description>MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability through method parameter injection into the shoutbox.

The saverestore module exposes its admin() method through the /objects/?module=saverestore endpoint without authentication because it uses gr('mode') (which reads directly from $_REQUEST) instead of the framework's $this-&gt;mode. An attacker can poison the system update URL via the auto_update_settings mode handler, then trigger the force_update handler to initiate the update chain. The autoUpdateSystem() method fetches an Atom feed from the attacker-controlled URL with trivial validation, downloads a tarball via curl with TLS verification disabled (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER set to FALSE), extracts it using exec('tar xzvf ...'), and copies all extracted files to the document root using copyTree().

The market module's admin() method reads gr('mode') from $_REQUEST and assigns it to $this-&gt;mode at the start of execution, making all mode-gated code paths reachable without authentication via the /objects/?module=market endpoint. The uninstall mode handler calls uninstallPlugin(), which deletes module records from the database, executes the module's uninstall() method via eval(), recursively deletes the module's directory and template files using removeTree(), and removes associated cycle scripts.

md: suspend array while updating raid_disks via sysfs

In raid1_reshape(), freeze_array() is called before modifying the r1bio
memory pool (conf-&gt;r1bio_pool) and conf-&gt;raid_disks, and
unfreeze_array() is called after the update is completed.

However, freeze_array() only waits until nr_sync_pending and
(nr_pending - nr_queued) of all buckets reaches zero. When an I/O error
occurs, nr_queued is increased and the corresponding r1bio is queued to
either retry_list or bio_end_io_list. As a result, freeze_array() may
unblock before these r1bios are released.

This can lead to a situation where conf-&gt;raid_disks and the mempool have
already been updated while queued r1bios, allocated with the old
raid_disks value, are later released. Consequently, free_r1bio() may
access memory out of bounds in put_all_bios() and release r1bios of the
wrong size to the new mempool, potentially causing issues with the
mempool as well.

Since only normal I/O might increase nr_queued while an I/O error occurs,
suspending the array avoids this issue.

Note: Updating raid_disks via ioctl SET_ARRAY_INFO already suspends
the array. Therefore, we suspend the array when updating raid_disks
via sysfs to avoid this issue too.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-71226 | wifi: iwlwifi: Implement settime64 as stub for MVM/MLD PTP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-71226</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset

During Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle and becomes
temporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers
during this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads)
can result in uncompleted PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or
system hangs.

To prevent this, set the `no_hw_access` flag to true immediately after
triggering the reset. This signals other driver components to skip
register accesses while the device is offline.

A memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added to ensure the flag update is
globally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait
state.

Since rescue mount options will mark the full fs read-only, there should
be no new transaction triggered.

But during unmount we will evict all inodes, which can trigger a new
transaction, and triggers warnings on a heavily corrupted fs.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs allows new transaction even on a read-only fs, this is to allow
log replay happen even on read-only mounts, just like what ext4/xfs do.

However with rescue mount options, the fs is fully read-only and cannot
be remounted read-write, thus in that case we should also reject any new
transactions.

[FIX]
If we find the fs has rescue mount options, we should treat the fs as
error, so that no new transaction can be started.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23215 | x86/vmware: Fix hypercall clobbers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/vmware: Fix hypercall clobbers

Fedora QA reported the following panic:

  #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode

because the QEMU VMware mouse emulation is buggy, and clears the top 32
bits of %rdi that the kernel kept a pointer in.

The QEMU vmmouse driver saves and restores the register state in a
"uint32_t data[6];" and as a result restores the state with the high
bits all cleared.

RDI originally contained the value of a valid kernel stack address
(0xff5eeb3240003e54).  After the vmware hypercall it now contains
0x40003e54, and we get a page fault as a result when it is dereferenced.

The proper fix would be in QEMU, but this works around the issue in the
kernel to keep old setups working, when old kernels had not happened to
keep any state in %rdi over the hypercall.

In theory this same issue exists for all the hypercalls in the vmmouse
driver; in practice it has only been seen with vmware_hypercall3() and
vmware_hypercall4().  For now, just mark RDI/RSI as clobbered for those
two calls.  This should have a minimal effect on code generation overall
as it should be rare for the compiler to want to make RDI/RSI live
across hypercalls.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-23216 | scsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-23216</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

(Functions in sbi_ecall.c are excluded from tracing if

__sbi_ecall triggers a snapshot of the ringbuffer. The snapshot code
raises an IPI interrupt, which results in another call to __sbi_ecall
and another snapshot...

All it takes to get into this endless loop is one initial __sbi_ecall.
On RISC-V systems without SSTC extension, the clock events in

Always exclude the sbi_ecall.c functions from tracing to fix the

sbi ecalls can easiliy be logged via trace events, excluding ecall

When __memcg_slab_post_alloc_hook() fails, there are two different
free paths depending on whether size == 1 or size != 1. In the
kmem_cache_free_bulk() path, we do call alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook().
However, in memcg_alloc_abort_single() we don't, the above warning will be
triggered on the next allocation.

Therefore, add alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook() to the
memcg_alloc_abort_single() path.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27099 | Jenkins 2.483 through 2.550 (both inclusive), LTS 2.492.1 through 2.541.1 (both inclusive) does not escape the user-provided description of ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27099</link><description>Jenkins 2.483 through 2.550 (both inclusive), LTS 2.492.1 through 2.541.1 (both inclusive) does not escape the user-provided description of the "Mark temporarily offline" offline cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure or Agent/Disconnect permission.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-27100 | Jenkins 2.550 and earlier, LTS 2.541.1 and earlier accepts Run Parameter values that refer to builds the user submitting the build does not ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-27100</link><description>Jenkins 2.550 and earlier, LTS 2.541.1 and earlier accepts Run Parameter values that refer to builds the user submitting the build does not have access to, allowing attackers with Item/Build and Item/Configure permission to obtain information about the existence of jobs, the existence of builds, and if a specified build exists, its display name.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:06:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-2329 | Grandstream GXP1600 VoIP Phones - Unauthenticated stack buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-2329</link><description>An unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the HTTP API endpoint /cgi-bin/api.values.get.

The application generates a new 'sessionId' each time a user authenticates, but does not invalidate previously issued session identifiers, which remain valid even after multiple consecutive logins by the same user. As a result, a stolen or leaked 'sessionId' can continue to be used to authenticate valid requests. Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker with access to the web service/API network (port 9000 or HTTP/S endpoint of the server) to reuse an old session token to gain unauthorized access to the application, interact with the API/web, and compromise the integrity of the affected account.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 14:13:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2026-1436 | Improper Access Control (IDOR) vulnerability in Graylog Web Interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1436</link><description>Improper Access Control (IDOR) in the Graylog API, version 2.2.3, which occurs when modifying the user ID in the URL.
