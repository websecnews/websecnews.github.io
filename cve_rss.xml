A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user’s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com.

This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account and read any file in the web server by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. A low privileged user may also perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Administrators.

The source-controller implements the source.toolkit.fluxcd.io API and is a core component of the GitOps toolkit. Prior to version 1.2.5, when source-controller was configured to use an Azure SAS token when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires. This vulnerability was fixed in source-controller v1.2.5.

Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:38:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35108 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;dataType=&amp;data...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35108</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /admin/homePro_deal.php?mudi=del&amp;amp;dataType=&amp;amp;dataTypeCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-35109 | idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;nohrefStr=close.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35109</link><description>idccms v1.35 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /homePro_deal.php?mudi=add&amp;amp;nohrefStr=close.</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 02:11:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4199 | Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress &amp;lt;= 4.2.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Missing Authorization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4199</link><description>The Bulk Posts Editing For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on the plugin's AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.3.

Starting in version 1.0.50 and prior to version 1.3.0, the way the proxy protocol listener is implemented in sshpiper can allow an attacker to forge their connecting address. Commit 2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430 added the proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address. Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.

In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may 
enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the
 designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 20:30:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-28132 | The T-Soft E-Commerce 4 web application is susceptible to SQL injection (SQLi) attacks when authenticated as an admin or privileged user.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:28:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32021 | Local Git clone may hardlink arbitrary user-readable files into the new repository&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;objects/&amp;quot; directory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32021</link><description>Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning
will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0862 | The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that allows an a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0862</link><description>The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to relay HTTP requests from the Protection server to otherwise private network addresses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3676 | The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains an Improper Input Validation vulnerability that allows an un...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3676</link><description>The Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection contains an Improper Input Validation vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker with a specially crafted HTTP request to create additional Encryption user accounts under the attacker's control.  These accounts are able to send spoofed email to any users within the domains configured by the Administrator.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:18:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32020 | Cloning local Git repository by untrusted user allows the untrusted user to modify objects in the cloned repository at will</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32020</link><description>Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a "proper" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:07:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2637 | Insecure Loading of Code in B&amp;amp;R Products</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2637</link><description>An authenticated local attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could insert and run arbitrary code using legitimate B&amp;amp;R software's.

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.

application. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that only affects PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled is present starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0 and prior to PrestaShop 8.1.6. When the customer thread feature flag is enabled through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office. The script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right. This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6. A workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:56:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34717 | Anonymous PrestaShop customer can download other customers&amp;#x27; invoices</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34717</link><description>PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application.

Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.

This vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn't have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34713 | sshproxy vulnerable to SSH option injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34713</link><description>sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on the gateway to an internal host via SSH. Prior to version 1.6.3, any user authorized to connect to a ssh server using `sshproxy` can inject options to the `ssh` command executed by `sshproxy`. All versions of `sshproxy` are impacted. The problem is patched starting in version 1.6.3. The only workaround is to use the `force_command` option in `sshproxy.yaml`, but it's rarely relevant.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 14:50:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34358 | TYPO3 vulnerable to an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in the ShowImageController</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34358</link><description>TYPO3 is an enterprise content management system. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, and 13.1.1, the `ShowImageController` (`_eID tx_cms_showpic_`) lacks a cryptographic HMAC-signature on the `frame` HTTP query parameter (e.g. `/index.php?eID=tx_cms_showpic?file=3&amp;...&amp;amp;frame=12345`). This allows adversaries to instruct the system to produce an arbitrary number of thumbnail images on the server side.

Prior to version 1.10.4, input to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban. Version 1.10.4 fixes this issue. Some workarounds are available. One may sanitize user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for. One may also encode input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 14:40:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4871 | Foreman: host ssh key not being checked in remote execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4871</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 14:40:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34357 | TYPO3 vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in ShowImageController</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34357</link><description>TYPO3 is an enterprise content management system.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1. Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 13:58:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1914 | An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could cause the robot to stop, make the robot controller inaccessible.
