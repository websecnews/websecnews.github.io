To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).Cisco&amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:46:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-1410 | Cisco Webex Meetings Unauthorized Distribution List Update Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1410</link><description>A vulnerability in the distribution list feature of Cisco&amp;nbsp;Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs to another user of their organization.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for requests to update distribution lists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to modify an existing distribution list. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs to a user other than themselves.Cisco&amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected device. Alternatively, the attacker could use man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a specifically crafted RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart and BGP routing could become unstable.Cisco&amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:25:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52431 | WordPress WP Video Robot plugin &amp;lt;= 1.20.0 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52431</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Pressaholic WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer allows SQL Injection.This issue affects WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer: from n/a through 1.20.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:47:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52435 | WordPress Premium Packages – Sell Digital Products Securely plugin &amp;lt;= 5.9.3 - SQL Injection vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52435</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in W3 Eden, Inc.
