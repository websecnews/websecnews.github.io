This is due to the extension blacklist not including .phar files, which can be uploaded through the chunked upload mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload executable .phar files and achieve remote code execution on the server, granted they can discover or enumerate the upload path. In order for an attacker to achieve RCE, the web server needs to be set up to process .phar file as PHP via file handler mapping or similar.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 03:53:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52457 | Observable Timing Discrepancy (CWE-208) in HBUS devices may allow an attacker with physical access to the device to extract device-specific ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-52457</link><description>Observable Timing Discrepancy (CWE-208) in HBUS devices may allow an attacker with physical access to the device to extract device-specific keys, potentially compromising further site security.

In versions from 22.11 to before 25.05 and versions before Unstable 25.11, a hard-coded secret was used in the NixOS module for the OnlyOffice document server to protect its file cache. An attacker with knowledge of an existing revision ID could use this secret to obtain a document. In practice, an arbitrary revision ID should be hard to obtain. The primary impact is likely the access to known documents from users with expired access. This issue was resolved in NixOS unstable version 25.11 and version 25.05.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:44:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13301 | itsourcecode Web-Based Internet Laboratory Management System controller.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13301</link><description>A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Web-Based Internet Laboratory Management System 1.0.

During the EAP-Response/Identity exchange, the subscriber's full Network Access Identifier (NAI), which embeds the raw IMSI, is transmitted without encryption, tunneling, or pseudonymization. An attacker located within Wi-Fi range (~100 meters) can passively capture these frames without requiring user interaction or elevated privileges. The disclosed IMSI enables device tracking, subscriber correlation, and long-term monitoring of user presence near any broadcasting Freebox device.

When the ESP32 is in advertising mode, if it receives a connection request containing an invalid Access Address (AA) of 0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF, advertising may stop unexpectedly. In this case, the controller may incorrectly report a connection event to the host, which can cause the application layer to assume that the device has successfully established a connection. This issue has been fixed in versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.5, 5.2.6, and 5.1.7. At time of publication versions 5.5.2, 5.3.5, and 5.1.7 have not been released but are fixed respectively in commits 3b95b50, e3d7042, and 75967b5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:34:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64756 | glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64756</link><description>Glob matches files using patterns the shell uses.

When rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. Users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page.

The vulnerability occurs in the webfonts API handling mechanism where font family names are not properly sanitized. An attacker can intercept fetch requests to the webfonts endpoint and inject malicious JavaScript payloads through font family names, resulting in session cookie theft, account hijacking, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users. The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a fetch hook that returns controlled font data containing malicious scripts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:59:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65083 | GoSign Desktop through 2.4.1 disables TLS certificate validation when configured to use a proxy server.

This can be problematic if the GoSign Desktop user selects an arbitrary proxy server without consideration of whether outbound HTTPS connections from the proxy server to Internet servers succeed even for untrusted or invalid server certificates. In this scenario (which is outside of the product's design objectives), integrity protection could be bypassed. In typical cases of a proxy server for outbound HTTPS traffic from an enterprise, those connections would not succeed. (Admittedly, the usual expectation is that a client application is configured to trust an enterprise CA and does not set SSL_VERIFY_NONE.) Also, it is of course unsafe to place ~/.gosign in the home directory of an untrusted user and then have other users execute downloaded files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:59:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13288 | Tenda CH22 PPTPUserSetting fromPptpUserSetting buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13288</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in Tenda CH22 1.0.0.1.
