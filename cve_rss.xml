Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 12:55:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5707 | The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all ve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5707</link><description>The SEO Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slider' shortcode and post meta in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

It is susceptible to a vulnerability where multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active Directory Users.

The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's permissions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:59:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5824 | Dos against http and https</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5824</link><description>Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attack against HTTP and HTTPS clients due to an Improper Handling of Structural Elements bug.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:59:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-1194 | Use-after-free in parse_lease_state()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1194</link><description>An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in parse_lease_state in the KSMBD implementation of the in-kernel samba server and CIFS in the Linux kernel.

Versions prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-45338 | Online Food Ordering System v1.0 - Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections (SQLi)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45338</link><description>Online Food Ordering System v1.0 is vulnerable to multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain packets when they are sent to the inspection engine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete all 9,472 byte blocks on the device, resulting in traffic loss across the device or an unexpected reload of the device. If the device does not reload on its own, a manual reload of the device would be required to recover from this state.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20270 | A vulnerability in the interaction between the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol preprocessor and the Snort 3 detection engine for Cisco F...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20270</link><description>A vulnerability in the interaction between the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol preprocessor and the Snort 3 detection engine for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper error-checking when the Snort 3 detection engine is processing SMB traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB packet stream through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:55:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20114 | A vulnerability in the file download feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attack...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20114</link><description>A vulnerability in the file download feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download arbitrary files from an affected system.

This vulnerability could also allow an attacker with valid user credentials, but not Administrator privileges, to view a system log file that they would not normally have access to. This vulnerability is due to a lack of rate-limiting of requests that are sent to a specific API that is related to an FMC log. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the FMC CPU spiking to 100 percent utilization or to the device reloading. CPU utilization would return to normal if the attack traffic was stopped before an unexpected reload was triggered.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:55:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-20086 | A vulnerability in ICMPv6 processing of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20086</link><description>A vulnerability in ICMPv6 processing of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper processing of ICMPv6 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ICMPv6 messages to a targeted Cisco ASA or FTD system with IPv6 enabled.

This vulnerability exists because a logic error occurs when a Snort 3 detection engine inspects an SSL/TLS connection that has either a URL Category configured on the SSL file policy or a URL Category configured on an access control policy with TLS server identity discovery enabled. Under specific, time-based constraints, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS connection through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an unexpected reload of the Snort 3 detection engine, resulting in either a bypass or denial of service (DoS) condition, depending on device configuration. The Snort 3 detection engine will restart automatically. No manual intervention is required.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:45:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5178 | Use after free in nvmet_tcp_free_crypto in nvme</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5178</link><description>A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel.

This security issue occurs because of insecure file operations or unsafe handling of temporary files and directories that lead to local privilege escalation. Before the insights-client has been registered on the system by root, an unprivileged local user or attacker could create the /var/tmp/insights-client directory (owning the directory with read, write, and execute permissions) on the system. After the insights-client is registered by root, an attacker could then control the directory content that insights are using by putting malicious scripts into it and executing arbitrary code as root (trivially bypassing SELinux protections because insights processes are allowed to disable SELinux system-wide).</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 15:57:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33228 | SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33228</link><description>The SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager was susceptible to the Exposure of Sensitive Information Vulnerability.
