Prior to 1.2, the Express server used express.json() without a size limit, which could allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This can cause excessive memory usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected. The issue is not a flaw in Express itself, but in configuration. This issue is fixed in version 1.2. To work around, consider adding a limit option to the JSON parser, rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level, rejecting unusually large requests before parsing, or using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 07:53:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10583 | WP Fastest Cache Premium &amp;lt;= 1.7.4 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Blind Server-Side Request Forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10583</link><description>The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.4 via the 'get_server_time_ajax_request' AJAX action.

Versions 0.23.1 mistakenly include an API endpoint that is intended for internal use by the SFTP software sftpgo, exposing it to the public-facing HTTP API for AzuraCast installations. A user with specific internal knowledge of a station's operations can craft a custom HTTP request that would affect the contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information about the station. In order to carry out an attack, a malicious user would need to know a valid SFTP station username and the coordinating internal filesystem structure.

Versions 6.5.2 and below use an inefficient algorithm when parsing parameters for HTTP header values, potentially causing a DoS. The _parseparam function in httputil.py is used to parse specific HTTP header values, such as those in multipart/form-data and repeatedly calls string.count() within a nested loop while processing quoted semicolons. If an attacker sends a request with a large number of maliciously crafted parameters in a Content-Disposition header, the server's CPU usage increases quadratically (O(n²)) during parsing. Due to Tornado's single event loop architecture, a single malicious request can cause the entire server to become unresponsive for an extended period. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 06:34:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10684 | Construction Light &amp;lt; 1.6.8 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Plugin Activation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10684</link><description>The Construction Light WordPress theme before 1.6.8 does not have authorisation and CSRF when activating  via an AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to activate arbitrary .</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 06:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67725 | Tornado is Vulnerable to Quadratic DoS via Repeated Header Coalescing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67725</link><description>Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In versions 6.5.2 and below, a single maliciously crafted HTTP request can block the server's event loop for an extended period, caused by the HTTPHeaders.add method. The function accumulates values using string concatenation when the same header name is repeated, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).  Due to Python string immutability, each concatenation copies the entire string, resulting in O(n²) time complexity. The severity can vary from high if max_header_size has been increased from its default, to low if it has its default value of 64KB. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3.</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 05:58:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67724 | Tornado vulnerable to Header Injection and XSS via reason argument</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67724</link><description>Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In versions 6.5.2 and below, the supplied reason phrase is used unescaped in HTTP headers (where it could be used for header injection) or in HTML in the default error page (where it could be used for XSS) and can be exploited by passing untrusted or malicious data into the reason argument. Used by both RequestHandler.set_status and tornado.web.HTTPError, the argument is designed to allow applications to pass custom "reason" phrases (the "Not Found" in HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found) to the HTTP status line (mainly for non-standard status codes).

POST Requests</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14046</link><description>An improper neutralization of input vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed user-supplied HTML to inject DOM elements with IDs that collided with server-initialized data islands. These collisions could overwrite or shadow critical application state objects used by certain Project views, leading to unintended server-side POST requests or other unauthorized backend interactions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have access to the target GitHub Enterprise Server instance and to entice a privileged user to view crafted malicious content that includes conflicting HTML elements. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.18.3, 3.17.9, 3.16.12, 3.15.16, and 3.14.21.</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 18:27:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14529 | Campcodes Retro Basketball Shoes Online Store admin_running.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14529</link><description>A flaw has been found in Campcodes Retro Basketball Shoes Online Store 1.0.

An attacker can embed triggers (e.g., JavaScript) in a PDF document that execute during the signing process. When a signer reviews the document, the content appears normal. However, once the signature is applied, the triggers modify content on other pages or optional content layers without explicit warning. This can cause the signed PDF to differ from what the signer saw, undermining the trustworthiness of the digital signature.

In versions 2.8.11 and below, the MySQLWriteTool executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using PDO::prepare() + execute() without semantic restrictions. This is consistent with the name (“write tool”), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, DELETE, ALTER, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions). Deployments that expose an agent with MySQLWriteTool enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges are impacted. This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:11:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67513 | FreePBX Endpoint Manager&amp;#x27;s Weak Default Password Allows Unauthenticated Access in Endpoint Module REST API</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67513</link><description>FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems.

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 22:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66474 | XWiki vulnerable to remote code execution through insufficient protection against {{/html}} injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66474</link><description>XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc).

The endpoint does not implement CSRF protections such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that submits a username-change request; when a victim visits the page while authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds. This allows an attacker to change the victim’s 1Panel username without consent.

While not an optimal patch, we have considered this sufficient and recommend users proceed to use the plugin with caution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9056 | Unprotected service in the AudioLink component allows a local attacker to overwrite system files via unauthorized service invocation.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9056</link><description>Unprotected service in the AudioLink component allows a local attacker to overwrite system files via unauthorized service invocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13613 | Elated Membership &amp;lt;= 1.2 - Authentication Bypass via Social Login</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13613</link><description>The Elated Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin not properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through the 'eltdf_membership_check_facebook_user' and the 'eltdf_membership_login_user_from_social_network' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing account on the site which can easily be created by default through the temp user functionality, and access to the administrative user's email.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 03:38:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67507 | Filament&amp;#x27;s multi-factor authentication (app) recovery codes can be used multiple times</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67507</link><description>Filament is a collection of full-stack components for accelerated Laravel development. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.3.0 contain a flaw in the handling of recovery codes for app-based multi-factor authentication, allowing the same recovery code to be reused indefinitely. This issue does not affect email-based MFA. It also only applies when recovery codes are enabled. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 02:06:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67485 | HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Interception Bypass in mad-proxy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67485</link><description>mad-proxy is a Python-based HTTP/HTTPS proxy server for detection and blocking of malicious web activity using custom security policies.

Versions prior to 0.1.0-beta expose POST /api/v1/record/buffer/convert through missing authentication. The endpoint accepts a file upload and converts it to PDF via LibreOffice by uploading payload to os.path.join(tmpdir, file.filename) without normalizing the filename. An attacker can submit a crafted filename containing ../ sequences to write arbitrary files anywhere the service account has permission, enabling remote file overwrite or planting malicious code. This issue is fixed in version 0.1.0-beta.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 02:06:08 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
