drm/vmwgfx: Create debugfs ttm_resource_manager entry only if needed

The driver creates /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/mob_ttm even when the
corresponding ttm_resource_manager is not allocated.
This leads to a crash when trying to read from this file.

Add a check to create mob_ttm, system_mob_ttm, and gmr_ttm debug file
only when the corresponding ttm_resource_manager is allocated.

net: phy: qcom: at803x: fix kernel panic with at8031_probe

On reworking and splitting the at803x driver, in splitting function of
at803x PHYs it was added a NULL dereference bug where priv is referenced
before it's actually allocated and then is tried to write to for the
is_1000basex and is_fiber variables in the case of at8031, writing on
the wrong address.

Fix this by correctly setting priv local variable only after
at803x_probe is called and actually allocates priv in the phydev struct.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26943 | nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26943</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure

The kcalloc() in nouveau_dmem_evict_chunk() will return null if
the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
src_pfns, dst_pfns or dma_addrs, the null pointer dereference bugs
will happen.

Moreover, the GPU is going away. If the kcalloc() fails, we could not
evict all pages mapping a chunk. So this patch adds a __GFP_NOFAIL
flag in kcalloc().

Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory,
this patch switches kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid
failing allocations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26944 | btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free in do_zone_finish()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26944</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

presence of the memory map for a PFN. A valid page for an address which
is reserved but not mapped by the kernel[1], the system crashed during

wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer

The previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer-&gt;device being
dereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to
instead get the device from ctx-&gt;wg. This semantically makes more sense
too, since ctx-&gt;wg-&gt;peer_allowedips.seq is compared with
ctx-&gt;allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a
defence in depth provision against freed peers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26951 | wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26951</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list

If all peers are removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), rather than setting
peer_list to empty, the peer is added to a temporary list with a head on
the stack of wg_peer_remove_all(). If a netlink dump is resumed and the
cursored peer is one that has been removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), it
will iterate from that peer and then attempt to dump freed peers.

Fix this by instead checking peer-&gt;is_dead, which was explictly created
for this purpose. Also move up the device_update_lock lockdep assertion,
since reading is_dead relies on that.

It can be reproduced by a small script like:

    echo "Setting config..."
    ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
    wg setconf wg0 /big-config
    (
            while true; do
                    echo "Showing config..."
                    wg showconf wg0 &gt; /dev/null
            done
    ) &amp;
    sleep 4
    wg setconf wg0 &lt;(printf "[Peer]\nPublicKey=$(wg genkey)\n")

nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings

Patch series "nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()".

This resolves a kernel BUG reported by syzbot.  Since there are two
flaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.

The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I think
both fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file data
to a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.

There are two flaws involved in this issue.

The first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using
btree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routine
nilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadata
corruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causes
nilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,
causing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.

The second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in
this inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()
or others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,
resulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()
failing.

This fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL
when a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the
conflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,
code -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during the
block lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error and
converted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26957 | s390/zcrypt: fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26957</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This is because we're completing the nfs_direct_request twice in a row.

The source of this is when we have our commit requests to submit, we
process them and send them off, and then in the completion path for the
commit requests we have

if (nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds))
	nfs_direct_write_complete(dreq);

However since we're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes have
one that completes before we submit the next one, so we end up calling
complete on the nfs_direct_request twice.

The only other place we use nfs_generic_commit_list() is in
__nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this call in a

nfs_commit_begin();
nfs_commit_end();

Which is a common pattern for this style of completion handling, one
that is also repeated in the direct code with get_dreq()/put_dreq()
calls around where we process events as well as in the completion paths.

Fix this by using the same pattern for the commit requests.

Before with my 200 node rocksdb stress running this warning would pop
every 10ish minutes.  With my patch the stress test has been running for
several hours without popping.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26959 | Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix btnxpuart_close</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26959</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8&lt;-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE".

swapoff-&gt;try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si-&gt;inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si-&gt;inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-&gt; count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-&gt; count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()-&gt;folio_free_swap()-&gt;delete_from_swap_cache()-&gt;
put_swap_folio()-&gt;free_swap_slot()-&gt;swapcache_free_entries()-&gt;
swap_entry_free()-&gt;swap_range_free()-&gt;
...
WRITE_ONCE(si-&gt;inuse_pages, si-&gt;inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

Handle the proper resource release in the RCU callback function
mac802154_llsec_key_del_rcu().

Note that if llsec_lookup_key() finds a key, it gets a refcount via
llsec_key_get() and locally copies key id from key_entry (which is a
list element). So it's safe to call llsec_key_put() and free the list
entry after the RCU grace period elapses.

dm-raid456, md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with reshape

For raid456, if reshape is still in progress, then IO across reshape
position will wait for reshape to make progress. However, for dm-raid,
in following cases reshape will never make progress hence IO will hang:

1) the array is read-only;
2) MD_RECOVERY_WAIT is set;
3) MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set;

After commit c467e97f079f ("md/raid6: use valid sector values to determine
if an I/O should wait on the reshape") fix the problem that IO across
reshape position doesn't wait for reshape, the dm-raid test
shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang:

[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6c/0x74

This is because reshape can't make progress.

For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register new sync_thread
doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more:

1) If array is read-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs;
2) md/raid never set MD_RECOVERY_WAIT;
3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn't hold
   'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue by
   sysfs api 'sync_action'.

However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problem in dm-raid yet. This
patch on the one hand make sure raid_message() can't change
sync_thread() through raid_message() after presuspend(), on the other
hand detect the above 3 cases before wait for IO do be done in
dm_suspend(), and let dm-raid requeue those IO.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26963 | usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26963</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: ubifs_symlink: Fix memleak of inode-&gt;i_link in error path

For error handling path in ubifs_symlink(), inode will be marked as
bad first, then iput() is invoked. If inode-&gt;i_link is initialized by
fscrypt_encrypt_symlink() in encryption scenario, inode-&gt;i_link won't
be freed by callchain ubifs_free_inode -&gt; fscrypt_free_inode in error
handling path, because make_bad_inode() has changed 'inode-&gt;i_mode' as
'S_IFREG'.
Following kmemleak is easy to be reproduced by injecting error in
ubifs_jnl_update() when doing symlink in encryption scenario:

There are two ways fixing it:

    because ubifs_evict_inode() will do same processes for good
    symlink inode and bad symlink inode, for inode-&gt;i_nlink checking
    is before is_bad_inode().
 2. Free inode-&gt;i_link before marking inode bad.
Method 2 is picked, it has less influence, personally, I think.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26973 | fat: fix uninitialized field in nostale filehandles</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26973</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery

During the PCI AER system's error recovery process, the kernel driver
may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's
memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function
scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout, and the reset_data
structure will be freed. However, this data structure is used for
completion notification after the restart is completed, which leads
to a UAF bug.

This results in a KFENCE bug notice.

  BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]

To resolve this race condition, the memory associated to the container
of the work_struct is freed on the worker if the timeout expired,
otherwise on the function that schedules the worker.
The timeout detection can be done by checking if the caller is
still waiting for completion or not by using completion_done() function.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:30:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26975 | powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26975</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed

Always flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its
completion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.
KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the
last reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to the
associated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed
vCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded
before the callback completes.

Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from
async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will
result in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()
finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes:

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with "wakeup all"
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contexts

vmw_context_cotable can return either an error or a null pointer and its
usage sometimes went unchecked. Subsequent code would then try to access
either a null pointer or an error value.

The invalid dereferences were only possible with malformed userspace
apps which never properly initialized the rendering contexts.

Check the results of vmw_context_cotable to fix the invalid derefs.

media: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access

When translating source to sink streams in the crossbar subdev, the
driver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink pad. The
remote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends
at an unconnected crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver
dereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.

Prevent the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and
return an error if it is.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52648 | drm/vmwgfx: Unmap the surface before resetting it on a plane state</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52648</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Unmap the surface before resetting it on a plane state

Switch to a new plane state requires unreferencing of all held surfaces.
In the work required for mob cursors the mapped surfaces started being
cached but the variable indicating whether the surface is currently
mapped was not being reset. This leads to crashes as the duplicated
state, incorrectly, indicates the that surface is mapped even when
no surface is present. That's because after unreferencing the surface
it's perfectly possible for the plane to be backed by a bo instead of a
surface.

Reset the surface mapped flag when unreferencing the plane state surface
to fix null derefs in cleanup. Fixes crashes in KDE KWin 6.0 on Wayland:

The system was under memory stress where driver was not able to allocate an
SRB to carry out error recovery of cable pull.  The failure to flush causes
upper layer to start modifying scsi_cmnd.  When the system frees up some
memory, the subsequent cable pull trigger another command flush. At this
point the driver access a null pointer when attempting to DMA unmap the
SGL.

Add a check to make sure commands are flush back on session tear down to
prevent the null pointer access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26932 | usb: typec: tcpm: fix double-free issue in tcpm_port_unregister_pd()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26932</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix deadlock in port "disable" sysfs attribute

The show and store callback routines for the "disable" sysfs attribute
file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub
device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub
to remove it or change its configuration:

	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the
	hub interface to be removed, which requires the port device
	to be removed, and device_del() waits until all outstanding
	sysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The
	lock can't be released until then.

	But the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return
	until after it has acquired the lock.

The resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling
sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not
to wait for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the
removal to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call,
there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at
any moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it
first by calling hub_get().</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26934 | USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26934</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in
drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is
the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 ("scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe ("scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function "pairs" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:19:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26937 | drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26937</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking

Originally, with strict in order execution, we could complete execution
only when the queue was empty. Preempt-to-busy allows replacement of an
active request that may complete before the preemption is processed by
HW. If that happens, the request is retired from the queue, but the
queue_priority_hint remains set, preventing direct submission until
after the next CS interrupt is processed.

This preempt-to-busy race can be triggered by the heartbeat, which will
also act as the power-management barrier and upon completion allow us to
idle the HW. We may process the completion of the heartbeat, and begin
parking the engine before the CS event that restores the
queue_priority_hint, causing us to fail the assertion that it is MIN.

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref-&gt;tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 ("drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
("drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm-&gt;mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().
v5: Replace "tile" with "GT" across commit description (Rodrigo),

In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `&lt;a&gt;` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Users who upgrade are also advised to configure a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 22:30:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34149 | In Bitcoin Core through 27.0 and Bitcoin Knots before 25.1.knots20231115, tapscript lacks a policy size limit check, a different issue than ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34149</link><description>In Bitcoin Core through 27.0 and Bitcoin Knots before 25.1.knots20231115, tapscript lacks a policy size limit check, a different issue than CVE-2023-50428.
