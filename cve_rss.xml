When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 19:25:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37902 | Path thraversal in DeepJavaLibrary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37902</link><description>DeepJavaLibrary(DJL) is an Engine-Agnostic Deep Learning Framework in Java. DJL versions 0.1.0 through 0.27.0 do not prevent absolute path archived artifacts from inserting archived files directly into the system, overwriting system files.

A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 19:25:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36543 | Incorrect access control in the Kafka Connect REST API in the STRIMZI Project 0.41.0 and earlier allows an attacker to deny the service for ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36543</link><description>Incorrect access control in the Kafka Connect REST API in the STRIMZI Project 0.41.0 and earlier allows an attacker to deny the service for Kafka Mirroring, potentially mirror the topics' content to his Kafka cluster via a malicious connector (bypassing Kafka ACL if it exists), and potentially steal Kafka SASL credentials, by querying the MirrorMaker Kafka REST API.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 19:16:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38449 | A Directory Traversal vulnerability in KasmVNC 1.3.1.230e50f7b89663316c70de7b0e3db6f6b9340489 and possibly earlier versions allows remote au...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38449</link><description>A Directory Traversal vulnerability in KasmVNC 1.3.1.230e50f7b89663316c70de7b0e3db6f6b9340489 and possibly earlier versions allows remote authenticated attackers to browse parent directories and read the content of files outside the scope of the application.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37840 | SQL injection vulnerability in processscore.php in Itsourcecode Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0 allows remot...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37840</link><description>SQL injection vulnerability in processscore.php in Itsourcecode Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the LessonID parameter.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 18:39:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6059 | Ingenico Estate Manager News Feed messages cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6059</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Ingenico Estate Manager 2023.
