Prior to version 1.8.9, in CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the URL of the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use a repo that uses a username and credential based URL, the entire URL will be included in the built Implementation Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL. Running the command `git remote origin url` should return a URL that contains no username, password, or token; or users should run the IG Publisher CLI with the `-repo` parameter and specify a URL that contains no username, password, or token.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 19:00:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52807 | XXE vulnerability in XSLT parsing in `org.hl7.fhir.publisher`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52807</link><description>The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.7.4, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag `( ]&gt;` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.publisher is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. A previous release provided an incomplete solution revealed by new testing. This issue has been patched as of version 1.7.4. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:45:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0703 | JoeyBling bootplus SysFileController.java path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0703</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d.

Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.

For some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Environment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.
- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.
- Running with debug artifacts enabled.
- Using CodeQL Action versions &lt;= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions &gt;= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and &lt;= 2.20.2.
- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.
- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:
- Using CodeQL Action versions &gt;= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and &lt;= 3.28.2, or &gt;= 2.26.11 and &lt; 3.
- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).

In rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.

In CodeQL CLI versions &gt;= 2.9.2 and &lt;= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. 

On Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.
The intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.

Therefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.

The impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:
- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions &gt;= 3.26.11 and &lt;= 3.28.2, or &gt;= 2.26.11 and &lt; 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.
- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:34:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0702 | JoeyBling bootplus SysFileController.java unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0702</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d.

Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:07:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24355 | Updatecli may expose Maven credentials in console output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24355</link><description>Updatecli is a tool used to apply file update strategies. Prior to version 0.93.0, private maven repository credentials may be leaked in application logs in case of unsuccessful retrieval operation. During the execution of an updatecli pipeline which contains a `maven` source configured with basic auth credentials, the credentials are being leaked in the application execution logs in case of failure. Credentials are properly sanitized when the operation is successful but not when for whatever reason there is a failure in the maven repository, e.g. wrong coordinates provided, not existing artifact or version. Version 0.93.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 16:54:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24359 | ASTEVAL Vulnerable to Maliciously Crafted Format Strings Leading to Sandbox Escape</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24359</link><description>ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 16:54:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22612 | Coolify Vulnerable to Private Key Enumeration on Onboarding resulting in Remote Command Execution (RCE)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22612</link><description>Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases.

In version 4.0.0-beta.358 and possibly earlier versions, when creating or updating a "project," it is possible to inject arbitrary shell commands by altering the project name. If a name includes unescaped characters, such as single quotes (`'`), it breaks out of the intended command structure, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host server, which could result in full system compromise; create, modify, or delete sensitive system files; and escalate privileges depending on the permissions of the executed process. Attackers with access to project management features could exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized control over the host environment. Version 4.0.0-beta.359 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 15:46:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0698 | JoeyBling bootplus list sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0698</link><description>A vulnerability was found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d.

Starting in version 4.0.0-beta.18 and prior to 4.0.0-beta.253, a vulnerability in the execution of commands on remote servers allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the local Coolify container, gaining access to data and private keys or tokens of other users/teams. The ability to inject malicious commands into the Coolify container gives authenticated attackers the ability to fully retrieve and control the data and availability of the software. Centrally hosted Coolify instances (open registration and/or multiple teams with potentially untrustworthy users) are especially at risk, as sensitive data of all users and connected servers can be leaked by any user. Additionally, attackers are able to modify the running software, potentially deploying malicious images to remote nodes or generally changing its behavior. Version 4.0.0-beta.253 patches this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 15:17:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9494 | Uncontrolled search path can lead to DLL hijacking in CP210 VCP Win 2k installer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9494</link><description>DLL hijacking vulnerabilities, caused by an uncontrolled search path in the

This CVE was originally reserved in 2021 and later publicly disclosed by Replicated on their website on 21 October 2021. However, it mistakenly remained in the Reserved But Public (RBP) status with the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). Please note that this product reached its end of life on 31 December 2024. Publishing this CVE with the CNA was required to comply with CNA rules, despite the fact that the issue was disclosed and fixed four years ago, and the affected product is no longer supported as of 2024.

Summary of VulnerabilityThis advisory discloses a low severity security vulnerability in the versions of Replicated Classic listed above (“Affected Replicated Classic Versions”)

DescriptionReplicated Classic versions prior to 2.53.1 have an authenticated API from the Replicated Admin Console that may expose sensitive data including application secrets, depending on how the application manifests are written. A user with valid credentials and access to the Admin Console port (8800) on the Replicated Classic server can retrieve container definitions including environment variables which may contain passwords and other secrets depending on how the application is configured.

This data is shared over authenticated sessions to the Admin Console only, and was never displayed or used in the application processing. To remediate this issue, we removed the sensitive data from the API, sending only the data to the Admin Console that was needed.

TimelineThis issue was discovered during a security review on 16 September 2021.
Patched versions were released on 23 September 2021.
This advisory was published on 21 October 2021.


The CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) notified Replicated on 23 January 2025 that the CVE was still in Reserved But Public (RBP) status. Upon discovering the oversight in updating the status to published with the CNA, Replicated submitted the updated report on the same day, 23 January 2025.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:51:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53379 | Heap buffer overflow in the server site handshake implementation in Real Time Logic LLC's SharkSSL version (from 05/05/24) commit 64808a5e12...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53379</link><description>Heap buffer overflow in the server site handshake implementation in Real Time Logic LLC's SharkSSL version (from 05/05/24) commit 64808a5e12c83b38f85c943dee0112e428dc2a43 allows a remote attacker to trigger a Denial-of-Service via a malformed Client-Hello message.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:28:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55573 | An issue was discovered in Centreon centreon-web 24.10.x before 24.10.3, 24.04.x before 24.04.9, 23.10.x before 23.10.19, 23.04.x before 23....</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55573</link><description>An issue was discovered in Centreon centreon-web 24.10.x before 24.10.3, 24.04.x before 24.04.9, 23.10.x before 23.10.19, 23.04.x before 23.04.24.

Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs. When debug logging is enabled, user access tokens are inadvertently logged, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data. Similarly, Kerberos Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs) are logged when debug logging is enabled. Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the **logon compliance script issue**, disable the `logon_script` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf`, and avoid using the `-d` flag when starting the `himmelblaud` daemon. For the Kerberos CCache issue, one may disable debug logging globally by setting the `debug` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf` to `false` and avoiding the `-d` parameter when starting `himmelblaud`.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:44:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45672 | IBM Security Verify Bridge data manipulation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45672</link><description>IBM Security Verify Bridge 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 could allow a local privileged user to overwrite files due to excessive privileges granted to the agent. which could also cause a denial of service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:38:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55929 | Mail spoofing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55929</link><description>Mail spoofing</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:38:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22153 | try/except* clauses could allow bypass RestrictedPython via type confusion bug in the CPython interpreter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22153</link><description>RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment.

netfilter: nf_set_pipapo: fix initial map fill

The initial buffer has to be inited to all-ones, but it must restrict
it to the size of the first field, not the total field size.

After each round in the map search step, the result and the fill map
are swapped, so if we have a set where f-&gt;bsize of the first element
is smaller than m-&gt;bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future
rounds result map.

This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where
first field size is not the largest.

A user with access to the Kubernetes cluster can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies managed by any version of Envoy Gateway prior to 1.2.6. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data). Version 1.2.6 fixes the issue. As a workaround, the `EnvoyProxy` API can be used to apply a bootstrap config patch that restricts access strictly to the prometheus stats endpoint.

An insecure default `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value could lead to sensitive data exposure for users of Cilium versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11, and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4 who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium Helm chart. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5. As a workaround, users who deploy Hubble UI using the Cilium Helm chart directly can remove the CORS headers from the Helm template as shown in the patch from commit a3489f190ba6e87b5336ee685fb6c80b1270d06d.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:31:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55957 | In Thermo Fisher Scientific Xcalibur before 4.7 SP1 and

networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11, and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic, an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy, the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured, existing connections may continue to operate, and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established, but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 16:59:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-51457 | IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51457</link><description>IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak 21.0.0 through 21.0.7.19 and 23.0.0 through 23.0.19 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow in a bounds check that allows for a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.
