In versions of gitsign starting with 0.6.0 and prior to 0.8.0, Rekor public keys were fetched via the Rekor API, instead of through the local TUF client. If the upstream Rekor server happened to be compromised, gitsign clients could potentially be tricked into trusting incorrect signatures. There is no known compromise the default public good instance (`rekor.sigstore.dev`) - anyone using this instance is unaffected. This issue was fixed in v0.8.0. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 21:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-36027 | Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36027</link><description>No english description</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 19:58:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47129 | Statamic CMS remote code execution via front-end form uploads</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47129</link><description>Statmic is a core Laravel content management system Composer package. Prior to versions 3.4.13 and 4.33.0, on front-end forms with an asset upload field, PHP files crafted to look like images may be uploaded. This only affects forms using the "Forms" feature and not just _any_ arbitrary form. This does not affect the control panel.

Prior to version 0.46.0, the grpc Unary Server Interceptor out of the box adds labels `net.peer.sock.addr` and `net.peer.sock.port` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent. An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests. Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used. The other possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing `otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider` option with `noop.NewMeterProvider`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 18:39:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47128 | piccolo SQL Injection via named transaction savepoints</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47128</link><description>Piccolo is an object-relational mapping and query builder which supports asyncio. Prior to version 1.1.1, the handling of named transaction `savepoints` in all database implementations is vulnerable to SQL Injection via f-strings. While the likelihood of an end developer exposing a `savepoints` `name` parameter to a user is highly unlikely, it would not be unheard of. If a malicious user was able to abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct access to the database and the ability to modify data to the level of permissions associated with the database user. A non exhaustive list of actions possible based on database permissions is: Read all data stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes; insert arbitrary data into the database, including modifying existing records; and gain a shell on the underlying server. Version 1.1.1 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 18:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46735 | Symfony potential Cross-site Scripting in WebhookController</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46735</link><description>Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components.

Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior to versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate the session after every successful login. It does so only in case the logged in user changes by means of checking the user identifier. In some use cases, the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and the successful login, while the token itself changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When this happens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session fixations, which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 17:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4949 | Memory Corruption Vulnerability in Grub-Legacy&amp;#x27;s XFS Implementation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4949</link><description>An attacker with local access to a system (either through a disk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition to grub-legacy in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grub’s XFS file system implementation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 17:26:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47611 | A CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, T...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47611</link><description>A CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists in Telit Cinterion BGS5, Telit Cinterion EHS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion PDS5/6/8, Telit Cinterion ELS61/81, Telit Cinterion PLS62 that could allow a local, low privileged attacker to elevate privileges to "manufacturer" level on the targeted system.</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 16:44:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-39295 | QuMagie</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39295</link><description>An OS command injection vulnerability has been reported to affect QuMagie.

For example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this to .\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \??\b.

An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).

This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.

It is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.

If it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions.
