Prior to version 0.1.1, the AWS Plugin is vulnerable to cross-account IAM role Impersonation in the AWS auth method. The vulnerability allows an IAM role from an untrusted AWS account to authenticate by impersonating a role with the same name in a trusted account, leading to unauthorized access. This impacts all users of the auth-aws plugin who operate in a multi-account AWS environment where IAM role names may not be unique across accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.1.1 of the auth-aws plugin. A workaround for this issue involves guaranteeing that IAM role names are unique across all AWS accounts that could potentially interact with your OpenBao environment, and to audit for any duplicate IAM roles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:33:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61132 | A Host Header Injection vulnerability in the password reset component in levlaz braindump v0.4.14 allows remote attackers to conduct passwor...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61132</link><description>A Host Header Injection vulnerability in the password reset component in levlaz braindump v0.4.14 allows remote attackers to conduct password reset poisoning and account takeover via manipulation of the Host header when Flask's url_for(_external=True) generates reset links without a fixed SERVER_NAME.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:12:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61136 | A Host Header Injection vulnerability in the password reset component in axewater sharewarez v2.4.3 allows remote attackers to conduct passw...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61136</link><description>A Host Header Injection vulnerability in the password reset component in axewater sharewarez v2.4.3 allows remote attackers to conduct password reset poisoning and account takeover via manipulation of the Host header when Flask's url_for(_external=True) generates reset links without a fixed SERVER_NAME.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:12:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56007 | CRLF-injection in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "/auth" API endpoint allows attackers to take over the device via adding additional users with fu...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56007</link><description>CRLF-injection in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "/auth" API endpoint allows attackers to take over the device via adding additional users with full permissions by managing the victim to open page with exploit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:41:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56008 | Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "Wireless ISP" page allows attackers located near to the router to take...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56008</link><description>Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "Wireless ISP" page allows attackers located near to the router to takeover the device via adding additional users with full permissions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:41:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56009 | Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "/rci" API endpoint allows attackers to take over the device via...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-56009</link><description>Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in KeeneticOS before 4.3 at "/rci" API endpoint allows attackers to take over the device via adding additional users with full permissions by managing the victim to open page with exploit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:41:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12110 | Keycloak: org.keycloak:keycloak-services: user can refresh offline session even after client&amp;#x27;s offline_access scope was removed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12110</link><description>A flaw was found in Keycloak.

Attackers could exploit this behavior remotely by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 09:33:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10914 | Reflected XSS in Proliz&amp;#x27;s OBS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10914</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Proliz Software Ltd.

In versions 1.8.1 and prior, an authentication bypass vulnerability in the BookMediaController allows any unauthenticated user to access and download book covers, thumbnails, and complete PDF/CBX page content without authorization. The vulnerability exists because multiple media endpoints lack proper access control annotations, and the CoverJwtFilter continues request processing even when no authentication token is provided. This enables attackers to enumerate and exfiltrate all book content from the system, bypassing the intended download permissions (canDownload) entirely.

The thunderbay_add_functions() will free memory of thunderbay_funcs
when everything is ok, but thunderbay_funcs will not be freed when
thunderbay_add_functions() fails, then there will be a memory leak,
so we need to add kfree() when thunderbay_add_functions() fails to
fix it.

In addition, doing some cleaner works, moving kfree(funcs) from
thunderbay_add_functions() to thunderbay_build_functions().</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50558 | regmap-irq: Use the new num_config_regs property in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50558</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap-irq: Use the new num_config_regs property in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode

Commit faa87ce9196d ("regmap-irq: Introduce config registers for irq
types") added the num_config_regs, then commit 9edd4f5aee84 ("regmap-irq:
Deprecate type registers and virtual registers") suggested to replace
num_type_reg with it. However, regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode wasn't modified
to use the new property. Later on, commit 255a03bb1bb3 ("ASoC: wcd9335:
Convert irq chip to config regs") removed the old num_type_reg property
from the WCD9335 driver's struct regmap_irq_chip, causing a null pointer
dereference in regmap_irq_set_type when it tried to index d-&gt;type_buf as
it was never allocated in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode:

drm/meson: explicitly remove aggregate driver at module unload time

Because component_master_del wasn't being called when unloading the
meson_drm module, the aggregate device would linger forever in the global
aggregate_devices list. That means when unloading and reloading the
meson_dw_hdmi module, component_add would call into
try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device and find the unbound meson_drm aggregate
device.

This would in turn dereference some of the aggregate_device's struct
entries which point to memory automatically freed by the devres API when
unbinding the aggregate device from meson_drv_unbind, and trigger an
use-after-free bug:

This can be easily reproduced using:
  1. create thin-pool
  2. dmsetup suspend pool
  3. dmsetup resume pool
  4. dmsetup remove_all # Concurrent with 3

The root cause of this UAF bug is that dm_resume() adds timer after
dm_destroy() skips cancelling the timer because of suspend status.
After timeout, it will call run_timer_softirq(), however pool has
already been freed. The concurrency UAF bug will happen.

Therefore, cancelling timer again in __pool_destroy().</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50564 | s390/netiucv: Fix return type of netiucv_tx()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50564</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/netiucv: Fix return type of netiucv_tx()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:1854:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
          .ndo_start_xmit         = netiucv_tx,
                                    ^~~~~~~~~~

-&gt;ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of netiucv_tx() to
match the prototype's to resolve the warning and potential CFI failure,
should s390 select ARCH_SUPPORTS_CFI_CLANG in the future.

Additionally, while in the area, remove a comment block that is no
longer relevant.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50565 | wifi: plfxlc: fix potential memory leak in __lf_x_usb_enable_rx()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50565</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix this bug by adding a check of bmp-&gt;db_agl2size in dbMount since this

usb: gadget: f_hid: fix f_hidg lifetime vs cdev

The embedded struct cdev does not have its lifetime correctly tied to
the enclosing struct f_hidg, so there is a use-after-free if /dev/hidgN
is held open while the gadget is deleted.

This can readily be replicated with libusbgx's example programs (for
conciseness - operating directly via configfs is equivalent):

	gadget-hid
	exec 3 /dev/hidg0
	gadget-vid-pid-remove
	exec 3&lt;&amp;-

Pull the existing device up in to struct f_hidg and make use of the
cdev_device_{add,del}() helpers.  This changes the lifetime of the
device object to match struct f_hidg, but note that it is still added
and deleted at the same time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50569 | xfrm: Update ipcomp_scratches with NULL when freed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50569</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: Update ipcomp_scratches with NULL when freed

Currently if ipcomp_alloc_scratches() fails to allocate memory
ipcomp_scratches holds obsolete address. So when we try to free the
percpu scratches using ipcomp_free_scratches() it tries to vfree non
existent vm area. Described below:

static void * __percpu *ipcomp_alloc_scratches(void)
{
        ...
        scratches = alloc_percpu(void *);
        if (!scratches)
                return NULL;
ipcomp_scratches does not know about this allocation failure.
Therefore holding the old obsolete address.
        ...
}

So when we free,

static void ipcomp_free_scratches(void)
{
        ...
        scratches = ipcomp_scratches;
Assigning obsolete address from ipcomp_scratches

        if (!scratches)
                return;

        for_each_possible_cpu(i)
               vfree(*per_cpu_ptr(scratches, i));
Trying to free non existent page, causing warning: trying to vfree

As comment of pci_get_slot() says, it returns a pci_device with its

calling pci_dev_put().

Since 'dma_dev' is only used to filter the channel in filter(), we can
call pci_dev_put() before exiting from pch_request_dma(). Add the

ima: Fix memory leak in __ima_inode_hash()

Commit f3cc6b25dcc5 ("ima: always measure and audit files in policy") lets
measurement or audit happen even if the file digest cannot be calculated.

As a result, iint-&gt;ima_hash could have been allocated despite
ima_collect_measurement() returning an error.

Since ima_hash belongs to a temporary inode metadata structure, declared
at the beginning of __ima_inode_hash(), just add a kfree() call if
ima_collect_measurement() returns an error different from -ENOMEM (in that
case, ima_hash should not have been allocated).</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-50578 | class: fix possible memory leak in __class_register()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-50578</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

class: fix possible memory leak in __class_register()

If class_add_groups() returns error, the 'cp-&gt;subsys' need be
unregister, and the 'cp' need be freed.

We can not call kset_unregister() here, because the 'cls' will
be freed in callback function class_release() and it's also
freed in caller's error path, it will cause double free.

So fix this by calling kobject_del() and kfree_const(name) to
cleanup kobject. Besides, call kfree() to free the 'cp'.

arm64: ftrace: fix module PLTs with mcount

Li Huafei reports that mcount-based ftrace with module PLTs was broken
by commit:

  a6253579977e4c6f ("arm64: ftrace: consistently handle PLTs.")

When a module PLTs are used and a module is loaded sufficiently far away
from the kernel, we'll create PLTs for any branches which are
out-of-range. These are separate from the special ftrace trampoline
PLTs, which the module PLT code doesn't directly manipulate.

When mcount is in use this is a problem, as each mcount callsite in a
module will be initialized to point to a module PLT, but since commit
a6253579977e4c6f ftrace_make_nop() will assume that the callsite has
been initialized to point to the special ftrace trampoline PLT, and
ftrace_find_callable_addr() rejects other cases.

This means that when ftrace tries to initialize a callsite via
ftrace_make_nop(), the call to ftrace_find_callable_addr() will find
that the `_mcount` stub is out-of-range and is not handled by the ftrace
PLT, resulting in a splat:

before writepages, there is no EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag. However
i_data is still store inline data in this scene. Then will trigger UAF

The root cause is traced to an error-handling path in qla2x00_probe_one()
when the adapter "base_vha" initialize failed. The fab_scan_rp "scan.l" is
used to record the port information and it is allocated in
qla2x00_create_host(). However, it is not released in the error handling
path "probe_failed".

Fix this by freeing the memory of "scan.l" when an error occurs in the
adapter initialization process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53697 | nvdimm: Fix memleak of pmu attr_groups in unregister_nvdimm_pmu()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53697</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: fix refcount underflow in error path

Fix a refcount underflow problem reported by syzbot that can happen
when a system is running out of memory. If xp_alloc_tx_descs() fails,
and it can only fail due to not having enough memory, then the error
path is triggered. In this error path, the refcount of the pool is
decremented as it has incremented before. However, the reference to
the pool in the socket was not nulled. This means that when the socket
is closed later, the socket teardown logic will think that there is a
pool attached to the socket and try to decrease the refcount again,
leading to a refcount underflow.

I chose this fix as it involved adding just a single line. Another
option would have been to move xp_get_pool() and the assignment of
xs-&gt;pool to after the if-statement and using xs_umem-&gt;pool instead of
xs-&gt;pool in the whole if-statement resulting in somewhat simpler code,
but this would have led to much more churn in the code base perhaps
making it harder to backport.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53699 | riscv: move memblock_allow_resize() after linear mapping is ready</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53699</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: move memblock_allow_resize() after linear mapping is ready

The initial memblock metadata is accessed from kernel image mapping. The
regions arrays need to "reallocated" from memblock and accessed through
linear mapping to cover more memblock regions. So the resizing should
not be allowed until linear mapping is ready. Note that there are
memblock allocations when building linear mapping.

This patch is similar to 24cc61d8cb5a ("arm64: memblock: don't permit
memblock resizing until linear mapping is up").

In following log, many memblock regions are reserved before
create_linear_mapping_page_table(). And then it triggered reallocation
of memblock.reserved.regions and memcpy the old array in kernel image
mapping to the new array in linear mapping which caused a page fault.

Replace of_iomap() and kzalloc() with devm_of_iomap() and devm_kzalloc()
which can automatically release the related memory when the device
or driver is removed or unloaded to avoid potential memory leak.

In this case, iounmap(anatop_base) in line 427,433 are removed
as manual release is not required.

Besides, referring to clk-imx8mq.c, check the return code of
of_clk_add_hw_provider, if it returns negtive, print error info
and unregister hws, which makes the program more robust.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53705 | ipv6: Fix out-of-bounds access in ipv6_find_tlv()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53705</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vmemmap/devdax: fix kernel crash when probing devdax devices

commit 4917f55b4ef9 ("mm/sparse-vmemmap: improve memory savings for
compound devmaps") added support for using optimized vmmemap for devdax
devices.  But how vmemmap mappings are created are architecture specific. 
For example, powerpc with hash translation doesn't have vmemmap mappings
in init_mm page table instead they are bolted table entries in the
hardware page table

vmemmap_populate_compound_pages() used by vmemmap optimization code is not
aware of these architecture-specific mapping.  Hence allow architecture to
opt for this feature.  I selected architectures supporting
HUGETLB_PAGE_OPTIMIZE_VMEMMAP option as also supporting this feature.

This patch fixes the below crash on ppc64.

ring-buffer: Handle race between rb_move_tail and rb_check_pages

It seems a data race between ring_buffer writing and integrity check.
That is, RB_FLAG of head_page is been updating, while at same time
RB_FLAG was cleared when doing integrity check rb_check_pages():

  rb_check_pages()            rb_handle_head_page():
  --------                    --------
  rb_head_page_deactivate()
                              rb_head_page_set_normal()
  rb_head_page_activate()

We do intergrity test of the list to check if the list is corrupted and
it is still worth doing it. So, let's refactor rb_check_pages() such that
we no longer clear and set flag during the list sanity checking.

[1] and [2] are the test to reproduce and the crash report respectively.

arm64: sme: Use STR P to clear FFR context field in streaming SVE mode

The FFR is a predicate register which can vary between 16 and 256 bits
in size depending upon the configured vector length. When saving the
SVE state in streaming SVE mode, the FFR register is inaccessible and
so commit 9f5848665788 ("arm64/sve: Make access to FFR optional") simply
clears the FFR field of the in-memory context structure. Unfortunately,
it achieves this using an unconditional 8-byte store and so if the SME
vector length is anything other than 64 bytes in size we will either
fail to clear the entire field or, worse, we will corrupt memory
immediately following the structure. This has led to intermittent kfence
splats in CI [1] and can trigger kmalloc Redzone corruption messages
when running the 'fp-stress' kselftest:

 | =============================================================================
 | BUG kmalloc-1k (Not tainted): kmalloc Redzone overwritten

Replace the 8-byte store with a store of a predicate register which has
been zero-initialised with PFALSE, ensuring that the entire field is
cleared in memory.

wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex

Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer
chips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of
passing it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.

OpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should

Also clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking

net: fix skb leak in __skb_tstamp_tx()

Commit 50749f2dd685 ("tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with
TX timestamp.") added a call to skb_orphan_frags_rx() to fix leaks with
zerocopy skbs. But it ended up adding a leak of its own. When
skb_orphan_frags_rx() fails, the function just returns, leaking the skb
it just cloned. Free it before returning.

This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis

wifi: ath9k: Fix potential stack-out-of-bounds write in ath9k_wmi_rsp_callback()

Fix a stack-out-of-bounds write that occurs in a WMI response callback
function that is called after a timeout occurs in ath9k_wmi_cmd().
The callback writes to wmi-&gt;cmd_rsp_buf, a stack-allocated buffer that
could no longer be valid when a timeout occurs. Set wmi-&gt;last_seq_id to
0 when a timeout occurred.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

ring-buffer: Do not swap cpu_buffer during resize process

When ring_buffer_swap_cpu was called during resize process,
the cpu buffer was swapped in the middle, resulting in incorrect state.
Continuing to run in the wrong state will result in oops.

This issue can be easily reproduced using the following two scripts:
/tmp # cat test1.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
         echo 2000 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
         sleep 0.5
         echo 5000 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
         sleep 0.5
done
/tmp # cat test2.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
        echo irqsoff &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
        sleep 1
        echo nop &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
        sleep 1
done
/tmp # ./test1.sh &amp;
/tmp # ./test2.sh &amp;

A typical oops log is as follows, sometimes with other different oops logs.

net/sched: fq_pie: avoid stalls in fq_pie_timer()

When setting a high number of flows (limit being 65536),
fq_pie_timer() is currently using too much time as syzbot reported.

Add logic to yield the cpu every 2048 flows (less than 150 usec
on debug kernels).
It should also help by not blocking qdisc fast paths for too long.
Worst case (65536 flows) would need 31 jiffies for a complete scan.

Relevant extract from syzbot report:

posix-timers: Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid

posix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix timer ID by starting from the
cached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.

This is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by
one. The loop has to terminate when the search wrapped around to the
starting point.

But that's racy vs. establishing the starting point. That is read out
lockless, which leads to the following problem:

CPU0	  	      	     	   CPU1
posix_timer_add()
  start = sig-&gt;posix_timer_id;
  lock(hash_lock);
  ...				   posix_timer_add()
  if (++sig-&gt;posix_timer_id &lt; 0)
      			             start = sig-&gt;posix_timer_id;
     sig-&gt;posix_timer_id = 0;

So CPU1 can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break
never happens because the condition can never be true:

  if (sig-&gt;posix_timer_id == start)
     break;

While this is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is
huge (INT_MAX), the racy read of the start value caught the attention of
KCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that incorrectness.

Rewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53729 | soc: qcom: qmi_encdec: Restrict string length in decode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53729</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

adjust_inuse_and_calc_cost() use spin_lock_irq() and IRQ will be enabled

IRQ before invoking it.

Fix it by using spin_lock_irqsave() instead, which can keep IRQ state
consistent with before when unlock.

Specifically, when a login or registration attempt is made with a non-existent username or email, the system responds with a message such as "account not found." Conversely, when the username or email exists but the password is incorrect, a different error message is returned. This discrepancy allows an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts by analyzing the error responses, potentially facilitating targeted social engineering, brute force, or credential stuffing attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:43:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11844 | XPath Injection in Hugging Face Smolagents search_item_ctrl_f Function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11844</link><description>Hugging Face Smolagents version 1.20.0 contains an XPath injection vulnerability in the search_item_ctrl_f function located in src/smolagents/vision_web_browser.py.

Promiscuous NS RRSets that complement positive DNS replies in the authority section can be used to trick resolvers to update their delegation information for the zone. Usually these RRSets are used to update the resolver's knowledge of the zone's name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point. Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible poison effect.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:08:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11086 | Academy LMS Pro &amp;lt;= 3.3.7 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Social Login Addon</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11086</link><description>The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.7.

The absence of encryption and authentication mechanisms in the communication protocol allows an attacker to capture legitimate traffic between the robot and the controller, replicate it, and send any valid command to the robot from any attacking computer or device. The communication protocol used in this interface is based on MAVLink, a widely documented protocol, which increases the likelihood of attack. There are two methods for connecting to the robot remotely: Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41109 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability in Ghost Robotics&amp;#x27; Vision 60</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-41109</link><description>Ghost Robotics Vision 60 v0.27.2 includes, among its physical interfaces, three RJ45 connectors and a USB Type-C port.

In Mastodon version 4.4, support for verifiable quote posts with quote controls was added, but it is possible for an attacker to bypass these controls in Mastodon versions prior to 4.4.8 and 4.5.0-beta.2. Mastodon internally treats reblogs as statuses. Since they were not special-treated, an attacker could reblog any post, then quote their reblog, technically quoting themselves, but having the quote feature a preview of the post they did not get authorization for with all of the affordances that would be otherwise denied by the quote controls.

This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding, allowing attacker-controlled input to be rendered directly in the browser. When exploited, an attacker can steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website. This can lead to user data compromise, loss of user trust, and a broader attack surface for more advanced exploitation techniques.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:00:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62250 | Improper Authentication in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 thro...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-62250</link><description>Improper Authentication in Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4, 7.4 GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions allows remote attackers to send malicious data to the Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.132, and older unsupported versions, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4, 7.4 GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions that will treat it as trusted data via unauthenticated cluster messages.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61220 | The incomplete verification mechanism in the AutoBizLine com.mysecondline.app 1.2.91 allows attackers to log in as other users and gain unau...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61220</link><description>The incomplete verification mechanism in the AutoBizLine com.mysecondline.app 1.2.91 allows attackers to log in as other users and gain unauthorized access to their personal information.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:41:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61181 | daicuocms V1.3.13 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the image upload feature.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61181</link><description>daicuocms V1.3.13 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the image upload feature.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:41:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60751 | GeographicLib 2.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in GeoConvert DMS::InternalDecode.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-60751</link><description>GeographicLib 2.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in GeoConvert DMS::InternalDecode.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-61194 | daicuocms V1.3.13 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the file library\think\db\Builder.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61194</link><description>daicuocms V1.3.13 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the file library\think\db\Builder.php.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:27:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36855 | DCMTK dcmqrscp parseQuota stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36855</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in DCMTK up to 3.6.5.

This allows an attacker with access to the network to read the transmitted sensitive data. An attacker can also freely modify the data on the wire. The monitoring clients transmit their data to the server using the unencrypted FTP. Clients connect to the FTP server on port 12304 and transmit the data unencrypted. In addition, all traffic between the console client and the server at port 12306 is unencrypted.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 12:00:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10640 | Missing Server-Side Authentication Checks in EfficientLab WorkExaminer Professional</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10640</link><description>An unauthenticated attacker with access to TCP port 12306 of the WorkExaminer server can exploit missing server-side authentication checks to bypass the login prompt in the WorkExaminer Professional console to gain administrative access to the WorkExaminer server and therefore all sensitive monitoring data. This includes monitored screenshots and keystrokes of all users.

The WorkExaminer Professional console is used for administrative access to the server. Before access to the console is granted administrators must login. Internally, a custom protocol is used to call a respective stored procedure on the MSSQL database. The return value of the call is not validated on the server-side. Instead it is only validated client-side which allows to bypass authentication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9428 | SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9428</link><description>Zohocorp ManageEngine Analytics Plus versions 6171 and prior are vulnerable to authenticated SQL Injection via the key update api.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10639 | Usage of Hardcoded FTP Credentials EfficientLab WorkExaminer Professional</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10639</link><description>The WorkExaminer Professional server installation comes with an FTP server that is used to receive the client logs on TCP port 12304. An attacker with network access to this port can use weak hardcoded credentials to login to the FTP server and modify or read data, log files and gain remote code execution as NT Authority\SYSTEM on the server by exchanging accessible service binaries in the WorkExaminer installation directory (e.g. "C:\Program File (x86)\Work Examiner Professional Server").</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:42:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-7473 | XML Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7473</link><description>Zohocorp ManageEngine EndPoint Central versions 11.4.2516.1 and prior are vulnerable to XML Injection.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 11:22:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5496 | Arbitrary File Deletion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5496</link><description>ZohoCorp ManageEngine Endpoint Central versions earlier than 11.4.2508.14, 11.4.2516.06, and 11.4.2518.01 are affected by an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the agent setup component.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10612 | XSS in GiSoft&amp;#x27;s City Guide</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10612</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in giSoft Information Technologies City Guide allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects City Guide: before 1.4.45.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 08:57:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26392 | SolarWinds Observability Self-Hosted SQL Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26392</link><description>SolarWinds Observability Self-Hosted is susceptible to SQL injection vulnerability that may display sensitive data using a low-level account.
