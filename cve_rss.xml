filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
do_lock_file_wait().
However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
in the middle).

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.

Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 08:12:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4260 | CoBlocks &amp;lt; 3.1.12 - Contributor+ SSRF</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4260</link><description>The Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks  WordPress plugin before 3.1.12 does not prevent users from pinging arbitrary hosts via some of its shortcodes, which could allow high privilege users such as contributors to perform SSRF attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6231 | Request a Quote &amp;lt; 2.4.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6231</link><description>The Request a Quote WordPress plugin before 2.4.1 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6420 | Hide My WP Ghost &amp;lt; 5.2.02 - Hidden Login Page Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6420</link><description>The Hide My WP Ghost  WordPress plugin before 5.2.02 does not prevent redirects to the login page via the auth_redirect WordPress function, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to access the hidden login page.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 06:27:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6828 | Redux Framework 4.4.12 -  4.4.17 - Unauthenticated JSON File Upload to Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6828</link><description>The Redux Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated JSON file uploads due to missing authorization and capability checks on the Redux_Color_Scheme_Import function in versions 4.4.12 to 4.4.17.

This vulnerability is fixed in 2.11.6, 2.10.15, and 2.9.20.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:38:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39688 | fishaudio/Bert-VITS2 Limited File Write in webui_preprocess.py generate_config function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39688</link><description>Bert-VITS2 is the VITS2 Backbone with multilingual bert.

An attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP whitelist, could potentially acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.

To mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37206 | WordPress Demo Awesome plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.1 -
