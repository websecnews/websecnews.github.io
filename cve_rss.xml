This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matches
the redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password or
omits both login and password.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 07:38:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-53290 | Dell ThinOS version 2408 contains an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability.

Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient validation of the "integration time" present in "v2" and "v3" bundles during the verification flow: the "integration time" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect "v1" bundles, as the "v1" bundle format always requires an inclusion promise.

Sigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 23:16:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54133 | Possible Content Security Policy bypass in Action Dispatch</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54133</link><description>Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:58:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55653 | pwndoc&amp;#x27;s UnhandledPromiseRejection on audits causes Denial of Service (DoS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55653</link><description>PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator. In versions up to and including 0.5.3, an authenticated user is able to crash the backend by raising a `UnhandledPromiseRejection` on audits which exits the backend. The user doesn't need to know the audit id, since a bad audit id will also raise the rejection. With the backend being unresponsive, the whole application becomes unusable for all users of the application. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 22:58:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43712 | Adobe Experience Manager | Cross-site Scripting (DOM-based XSS) (CWE-79)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43712</link><description>Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.

evasion</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53866</link><description>The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:19:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55602 | PenDoc vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read on updating and downloading templates using Path Traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55602</link><description>PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator.

Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:48:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12236 | Use of Custom URI for media inputs with VPC-SC enabled potentially leads to data exfiltration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12236</link><description>A security issue exists in Vertex Gemini API for customers using VPC-SC. By utilizing a custom crafted file URI for image input, data exfiltration is possible due to requests being routed outside the VPC-SC security perimeter, circumventing the intended security restrictions of VPC-SC.

No further fix actions are needed. Google Cloud Platform implemented a fix to return an error message when a media file URL is specified in the fileUri parameter and VPC Service Controls is enabled. Other use cases are unaffected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:24:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12323 | turboSMTP &amp;lt;= 4.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via &amp;#x27;page&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12323</link><description>The turboSMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘page’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

Winter CMS prior to versions 1.2.7, 1.1.11, and 1.0.476 allow users with access to the CMS templates sections that modify Twig files to bypass the sandbox placed on Twig files and modify resources such as theme customisation values or modify, or remove, templates in the theme even if not provided direct access via the permissions. As all objects passed through to Twig are references to the live objects, it is also possible to also manipulate model data if models are passed directly to Twig, including changing attributes or even removing records entirely. In most cases, this is unwanted behavior and potentially dangerous. To actively exploit this security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a user account with any of the following permissions: `cms.manage_layouts`; `cms.manage_pages`; or `cms.manage_partials`. The Winter CMS maintainers strongly recommend that these permissions only be reserved to trusted administrators and developers in general. The maintainers of Winter CMS have significantly increased the scope of the sandbox, effectively making all models and datasources read-only in Twig, in versions 1.2.7, 1.1.11, and 1.0.476. Thse who cannot upgrade may apply commit fb88e6fabde3b3278ce1844e581c87dcf7daee22 to their Winter CMS installation manually to resolve the issue. In the rare event that a Winter user was relying on being able to write to models/datasources within their Twig templates, they should instead use or create components to make changes to their models.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 20:59:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-54151 | Directus allows unauthenticated access to WebSocket events and operations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-54151</link><description>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content.
