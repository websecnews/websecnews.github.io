In affected versions, proxy configuration data—potentially including sensitive details—was written to log files in clear text whenever an HTTP GET request was made through a proxy. An attacker with read access to these logs could obtain the proxy information and leverage it for further attacks or unauthorized access. Starting with version 4.39.0, Docker Desktop no longer logs the proxy string, thereby mitigating this risk.</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-38311 | Apache Traffic Server: Request smuggling via pipelining after a chunked message body</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38311</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Traffic Server.

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:51:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25632 | Tenda AC15 v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to Command Injection via the handler function in /goform/telnet.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25632</link><description>Tenda AC15 v15.03.05.19 is vulnerable to Command Injection via the handler function in /goform/telnet.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:34:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25634 | A vulnerability has been found in Tenda AC15 15.03.05.19 in the function GetParentControlInfo of the file /goform/GetParentControlInfo.
