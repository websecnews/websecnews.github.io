tokens to non-Azure container registries</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27403</link><description>Ratify is a verification engine as a binary executable and on Kubernetes which enables verification of artifact security metadata and admits for deployment only those that comply with policies the user creates. In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratifyâs Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:35:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-12546 | Potential iSCSI R2T PDU Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12546</link><description>EDK2 contains a vulnerability in BIOS where a user may cause an Integer Overflow or Wraparound by network means.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 22:31:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25907 | tianti v2.3 was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via the component /user/ajax/save.

Prior to versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3, by spoofing a webhook payload with a specific set of headers and body data, an attacker could transfer ownership of a repository and its repo level secrets to a separate repository. These secrets could be exfiltrated by follow up builds to the repository. Users with an enabled repository with access to repo level CI secrets in Vela are vulnerable to the exploit, and any user with access to the CI instance and the linked source control manager can perform the exploit. Versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 19:09:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27615 | umatiGateway&amp;#x27;s UI publicly accessible in provided docker-compose file</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27615</link><description>umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages.

Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML document during bucket creation, the service's XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:37:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56184 | In static long dev_send of tipc_dev_ql, there is a possible out of bounds read due to an incorrect bounds check.

This issue affects Apache OFBiz: from 18.12.17 before 18.12.18.Â Â 

It's a regression between 18.12.17 and 18.12.18.
In case you use something like that, which is not recommended!
For security, only official releases should be used.

In other words, if you use 18.12.17 you are still safe.
The version 18.12.17 is not a affected.
But something between 18.12.17 and 18.12.18 is.

In that case, users are recommended to upgrade to version 18.12.18, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:18:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2153 | HDF5 h5 File H5SM.c H5SM_delete heap-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2153</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in HDF5 1.14.6.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through &lt;= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through &lt;= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through &lt;= 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with "Camel", "camel", or "org.apache.camel.". Attackers can bypass this filter by altering the casing of letters. This allows attackers to inject headers which can be exploited to invoke arbitrary methods from the Bean registry and also supports using Simple Expression Language (or OGNL in some cases) as part of the method parameters passed to the bean. It's important to note that only methods in the same bean declared in the bean URI could be invoked.


Mitigation:Â You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing theÂ headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, alsoÂ globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like "cAmel, cAMEL" etc, or in general everything not starting with "Camel", "camel" or "org.apache.camel.".</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:40:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2121 | Thinkware Car Dashcam F800 Pro File Storage access control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2121</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Thinkware Car Dashcam F800 Pro up to 20250226.
