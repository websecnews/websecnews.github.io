tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head-&gt;write_buf when write()
of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head-&gt;write_buf after
head-&gt;io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can
cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 07:13:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20005 | In da, there is a possible permission bypass due to a missing permission check.

mm/damon/vaddr-test: fix memory leak in damon_do_test_apply_three_regions()

When CONFIG_DAMON_VADDR_KUNIT_TEST=y and making CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK=y
and CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_AUTO_SCAN=y, the below memory leak is detected.

Since commit 9f86d624292c ("mm/damon/vaddr-test: remove unnecessary
variables"), the damon_destroy_ctx() is removed, but still call
damon_new_target() and damon_new_region(), the damon_region which is
allocated by kmem_cache_alloc() in damon_new_region() and the damon_target
which is allocated by kmalloc in damon_new_target() are not freed.  And
the damon_region which is allocated in damon_new_region() in
damon_set_regions() is also not freed.

So use damon_destroy_target to free all the damon_regions and damon_target.

mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()

After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does not
release all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmod
time), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing it
from the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()
ignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removes
the kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() fails
to release all of the cache's slabs.

This is easily observable on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y
as after that ill release the system will immediately trip on list_add,
or list_del, assertions similar to the one shown below as soon as another
kmem_cache gets created, or destroyed:

Another quick way to trigger this issue, in a kernel with CONFIG_SLUB=y,
is to set slub_debug to poison the released objects and then just run
cat /proc/slabinfo after removing the module that leaks slab objects,
in which case the kernel will panic:

Revert "tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux"

This reverts commit 9b9c8195f3f0d74a826077fc1c01b9ee74907239.

The commit above is reverted as it did not solve the original issue.

gsm_cleanup_mux() tries to free up the virtual ttys by calling
gsm_dlci_release() for each available DLCI. There, dlci_put() is called to
decrease the reference counter for the DLCI via tty_port_put() which
finally calls gsm_dlci_free(). This already clears the pointer which is
being checked in gsm_cleanup_mux() before calling gsm_dlci_release().
Therefore, it is not necessary to clear this pointer in gsm_cleanup_mux()
as done in the reverted commit. The commit introduces a null pointer
dereference:

The actual issue is that nothing guards dlci_put() from being called

nilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()

In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(), brelse(bh) is called to drop the
reference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If
the reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked, bh may be
freed.  However, bh-&gt;b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that,
which may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release
operation after unlocking and putting the page.

NOTE: The function in question is only called in GC, and in combination
with current userland tools, address translation using DAT does not occur
in that function, so the code path that causes this issue will not be
executed.  However, it is possible to run that code path by intentionally
modifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.

x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race

The SGX EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an
enclave and set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG
and ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for
secs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.

Fix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as
needed for both EAUG and ELDU.

The SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed
when there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,
virtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is
paged back in.

An enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS
page. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race
with paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A
triggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS
both are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.

Hitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.
Following is a trace when it happens.

btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item

Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item
into the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we
have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before
calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
snapshots in the transaction commit path).

So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.

This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it because
it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehow
we attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 22:12:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52570 | vfio/mdev: Fix a null-ptr-deref bug for mdev_unregister_parent()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52570</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

1. After send request to server, wait the response until

2. Receive response from server, and set it to mid;
3. Set the mid state to RECEIVED;
4. Kill the process, the mid state already RECEIVED, get 0;
5. Handle and release the negotiate response;
6. UAF.

It can be easily reproduce with add some delay in [3] - [6].

Only sync call has the problem since async call's callback is
executed in cifsd process.

Add an extra state to mark the mid state to READY before wakeup the
waitter, then it can get the resp safely.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 22:12:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52573 | net: rds: Fix possible NULL-pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52573</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When enslave a vlan device to team device and team device type is changed
from non-ether to ether, header_ops of team device is changed to
vlan_header_ops. That is incorrect and will trigger null-ptr-deref
for vlan-&gt;real_dev in vlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not
a vlan device.

Cache eth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to
header_ops of team net device when its type is changed from non-ether
to ether to fix the bug.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 22:12:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52575 | x86/srso: Fix SBPB enablement for spec_rstack_overflow=off</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52575</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer()

The code calling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs long after the memblock
allocator has already been torn down, potentially resulting in a use
after free in memblock_isolate_range().

With KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free will result in a BUG
from the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic.

Switch ima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid
that bug.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 22:12:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52577 | dccp: fix dccp_v4_err()/dccp_v6_err() again</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52577</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/core: Fix ETH_P_1588 flow dissector

When a PTP ethernet raw frame with a size of more than 256 bytes followed
by a 0xff pattern is sent to __skb_flow_dissect, nhoff value calculation
is wrong. For example: hdr-&gt;message_length takes the wrong value (0xffff)
and it does not replicate real header length. In this case, 'nhoff' value
was overridden and the PTP header was badly dissected. This leads to a
kernel crash.

net/core: flow_dissector
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0000000e
net/core flow dissector hdr-&gt;message_length = 0x0000ffff
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0001000d (u16 overflow)
...
skb linear:   00000000: 00 a0 c9 00 00 00 00 a0 c9 00 00 00 88
skb frag:     00000000: f7 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

Using the size of the ptp_header struct will allow the corrected
calculation of the nhoff value.

net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0000000e
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x00000030 (sizeof ptp_header)

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired

When more than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new gc
container structure.

This never happens: u8 type will wrap before reaching the boundary
and nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true.

This means we recycle the initial gc container structure and
lose track of the elements that came before.

While at it, don't deref 'gc' after we've passed it to call_rcu.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 22:12:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52582 | netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52582</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio

If a network filesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length()
function, it can set subrequest lengths smaller than a page size.

When we loop through the folios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to
set any folios to be written back, we need to make sure we only
call folio_start_fscache() once for each folio.

Otherwise, this simple testcase:

  mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file.bin bs=4096 count=1

When unmounting all the dirty buffers will be flushed and after

and the unmounting won't wait the possible acks, which will ihold
the inodes when updating the metadata locally but makes no sense
any more, of this. This will make the evict_inodes() to skip these
inodes.

The problem is in ret_from_syscall where the check for
icache_44x_need_flush is done. When the flush is needed the code jumps
out-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue
the syscall return.

However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correct
location, instead branching back just prior to the return to userspace,
causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.

The breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc
("powerpc/syscall: implement system call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32") which
inadvertently removed the "1" label and reused it elsewhere.

Fix it by adding named local labels in the correct locations. Note that
the return label needs to be outside the ifdef so that CONFIG_PPC_47x=n
compiles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52500 | scsi: pm80xx: Avoid leaking tags when processing OPC_INB_SET_CONTROLLER_CONFIG command</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52500</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

handle it, but that code missed the case where the last event was at the
very end of the page and has only 4 bytes left.

The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the
length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the
length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process
of updating that code, there's a small window where the length in the first
4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will
cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the
allocated page.

To protect against this, fail immediately if the next event pointer is
less than 8 bytes from the end of the commit (last byte of data), as all
events must be a minimum of 8 bytes anyway.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52502 | net: nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52502</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()

Sili Luo reported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF.

Getting a reference on the socket found in a lookup while
holding a lock should happen before releasing the lock.

nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() has a similar problem.

Finally nfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure the socket
found by nfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52503 | tee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52503</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session

There is a potential race condition in amdtee_close_session that may
cause use-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance, if a session
has refcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session via:

    kref_put(&amp;sess-&gt;refcount, destroy_session);

the reference count will get decremented, and the next step would be to
call destroy_session(). However, if in another thread,
amdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completed
execution, alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed up
later in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free in
amdtee_open_session.

To fix this issue, treat decrement of sess-&gt;refcount and removal of
'sess' from session list in destroy_session() as a critical section, so
that it is executed atomically.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52504 | x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52504</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()

Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on
a 5-level paging machine:

	BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching()
	Read of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0
	...
	__asan_load4()
	rcu_is_watching()
	trace_hardirqs_on()
	text_poke_early()
	apply_alternatives()
	...

On machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57)
gets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on
__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().

KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the
KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START
static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.

Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.

phy: lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registers

The protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD
(implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol
converters from multiple lanes (each represented as a different
struct phy). So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext()
to lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the "old" or for the
"new" protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware is
possible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking.

Add a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and take
the global spinlock from the phy_ops :: set_mode() implementation. There
are no other callers which modify PCC registers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52506 | LoongArch: Set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52506</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The reason is early memblock_reserve() in memblock_init() set node id to
MAX_NUMNODES, making NODE_DATA(nid) a NULL dereference in the call chain
reserve_bootmem_region() -&gt; init_reserved_page(). After memblock_init(),
those late calls of memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock
.memory regions. As a result, these reserved regions will be set to the
correct node at the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages().

So set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid this
panic.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52507 | nfc: nci: assert requested protocol is valid</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52507</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: sun6i: reduce DMA RX transfer width to single byte

Through empirical testing it has been determined that sometimes RX SPI
transfers with DMA enabled return corrupted data. This is down to single

memory. It seems the RX FIFO within the SPI peripheral can become
confused when performing bus read accesses wider than a single byte to it
during an active SPI transfer.

This patch reduces the width of individual DMA read accesses to the

spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain

Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to
read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is
correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the
transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be
transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO
still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure
and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO, corrupting any data
read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to
DMA progress in DMA mode, thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA
mode is a bug.
Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode.
Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to
ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52518 | Bluetooth: hci_codec: Fix leaking content of local_codecs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52518</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit

The EHL (Elkhart Lake) based platforms provide a OOB (Out of band)
service, which allows to wakup device when the system is in S5 (Soft-Off
state). This OOB service can be enabled/disabled from BIOS settings. When
enabled, the ISH device gets PME wake capability. To enable PME wakeup,
driver also needs to enable ACPI GPE bit.

On resume, BIOS will clear the wakeup bit. So driver need to re-enable it
in resume function to keep the next wakeup capability. But this BIOS
clearing of wakeup bit doesn't decrement internal OS GPE reference count,
so this reenabling on every resume will cause reference count to overflow.

So first disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit using acpi_disable_gpe().</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52520 | platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52520</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The bpf_long_memcpy is used with 8-byte aligned pointers, power-of-8 size
and forced to use long read/writes to try to atomically copy long counters.
It is best-effort only and no barriers are here since it _will_ race with
concurrent updates from BPF programs. The bpf_long_memcpy() is called from
bpf(2) syscall. Marco suggested that the best way to make this known to
KCSAN would be to use data_race() annotation.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52522 | net: fix possible store tearing in neigh_periodic_work()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52522</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Reject sk_msg egress redirects to non-TCP sockets

With a SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH map and an sk_msg program user can steer messages
sent from one TCP socket (s1) to actually egress from another TCP
socket (s2):

tcp_bpf_sendmsg(s1)		// = sk_prot-&gt;sendmsg
  tcp_bpf_send_verdict(s1)	// __SK_REDIRECT case
    tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir(s2)
      tcp_bpf_push_locked(s2)
	tcp_bpf_push(s2)
	  tcp_rate_check_app_limited(s2) // expects tcp_sock
	  tcp_sendmsg_locked(s2)	 // ditto

There is a hard-coded assumption in the call-chain, that the egress
socket (s2) is a TCP socket.

However in commit 122e6c79efe1 ("sock_map: Update sock type checks for
UDP") we have enabled redirects to non-TCP sockets. This was done for the
sake of BPF sk_skb programs. There was no indention to support sk_msg
send-to-egress use case.

As a result, attempts to send-to-egress through a non-TCP socket lead to a
crash due to invalid downcast from sock to tcp_sock:

ipv4, ipv6: Fix handling of transhdrlen in __ip{,6}_append_data()

Including the transhdrlen in length is a problem when the packet is
partially filled (e.g. something like send(MSG_MORE) happened previously)
when appending to an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as we don't want to repeat the
transport header or account for it twice.  This can happen under some
circumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.

The symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data():

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800 __ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800

that occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an already
partially occupied skbuff.  The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger than
the amount of data in the message iterator.  This is because the requested
length includes the transport header length when it shouldn't.  This can be
triggered by, for example:

        sfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP);
        bind(sfd, ...); // ::1
        connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7
        send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);
        sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024);

Fix this by only adding transhdrlen into the length if the write queue is
empty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(), analogously to how UDP does things.

l2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it won't suffer from this problem as it builds
the UDP packet itself.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52528 | net: usb: smsc75xx: Fix uninit-value access in __smsc75xx_read_reg</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52528</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This issue is caused because usbnet_read_cmd() reads less bytes than requested
(zero byte in the reproducer). In this case, 'buf' is not properly filled.

This patch fixes the issue by returning -ENODATA if usbnet_read_cmd() reads
less bytes than requested.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52529 | HID: sony: Fix a potential memory leak in sony_probe()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52529</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix potential key use-after-free

When ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()
but returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall),
ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return a pointer into the
key, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn't happen
since it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload
which has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do
that by returning an error code and converting that to success on
the cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers of
ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52531 | wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52531</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue

A few lines above, space is kzalloc()'ed for:
	sizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) +
	sizeof(struct ieee80211_channel) +
	sizeof(struct ieee80211_rate)

'mvm-&gt;nvm_data' is a 'struct iwl_nvm_data', so it is fine.

At the end of this structure, there is the 'channels' flex array.
Each element is of type 'struct ieee80211_channel'.
So only 1 element is allocated in this array.

When doing:
  mvm-&gt;nvm_data-&gt;bands[0].channels = mvm-&gt;nvm_data-&gt;channels;
We point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array.
So this is fine.

However, when doing:
  mvm-&gt;nvm_data-&gt;bands[0].bitrates =
			(void *)((u8 *)mvm-&gt;nvm_data-&gt;channels + 1);
because of the "(u8 *)" cast, we add only 1 to the address of the beginning
of the flex array.

It is likely that we want point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocated
just after.

Remove the spurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic works as
expected.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52532 | net: mana: Fix TX CQE error handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52532</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mana: Fix TX CQE error handling

For an unknown TX CQE error type (probably from a newer hardware),
still free the SKB, update the queue tail, etc., otherwise the
accounting will be wrong.

Also, TX errors can be triggered by injecting corrupted packets, so
replace the WARN_ONCE to ratelimited error logging.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25865 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in hexo-theme-anzhiyu v1.6.12, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the algolia se...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25865</link><description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in hexo-theme-anzhiyu v1.6.12, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the algolia search function.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:58:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0968 | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM in langchain-ai/chat-langchain</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0968</link><description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM in GitHub repository langchain-ai/chat-langchain prior to 0.0.0.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:44:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48627 | vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48627</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer

A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory
overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized
to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination
buffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is not always
broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware acceleration, whose
result is not deterministic.

Fix this problem by using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 21:37:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26621 | mm: huge_memory: don&amp;#x27;t force huge page alignment on 32 bit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26621</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP

userspace.

It doesn't make too much sense to force huge page alignment on 32 bit
system due to the constrained virtual address space.
