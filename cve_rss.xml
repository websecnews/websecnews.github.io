The affected version is langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite 2.0.10. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of filter operators ($eq, $ne, $gt, $lt, $gte, $lte) where direct string concatenation is used without proper parameterization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL, leading to unauthorized access to all documents, data exfiltration of sensitive fields such as passwords and API keys, and a complete bypass of application-level security filters.</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 05:53:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55757 | Extension - virtuemart.net - XSS in VirtueMart component 1.0.0 - 4.4.10 for Joomla</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55757</link><description>A unauthenticated reflected XSS vulnerability in VirtueMart 1.0.0-4.4.10 for Joomla was discovered.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 18:42:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12221 | CSRF Token not Properly Implemented</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12221</link><description>Busybox 1.31.1 - Multiple Known Vulnerabilities.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 16:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12218 | Weak Default Credentials</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12218</link><description>Weak Default Credentials.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 16:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12219 | Vulnerable Components in Azure Access OS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12219</link><description>Vulnerable Components in Azure Access OS.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 16:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12220 | Busybox 1.31.1 - Multiple Known Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12220</link><description>Busybox 1.31.1 - Multiple Known Vulnerabilities.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 16:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12217 | SNMP Default Community String (public)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12217</link><description>SNMP Default Community String (public).This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 15:43:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12216 | Malicious / Malformed App can be Installed but not Uninstalled</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-12216</link><description>Malicious / Malformed App can be Installed but not Uninstalled/may lead to unavailability.This issue affects BLU-IC2: through 1.19.5; BLU-IC4: through 1.19.5.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 15:43:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11897 | The7 — Ultimate WordPress &amp;amp; WooCommerce Theme &amp;lt;= 12.9.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via &amp;#x27;the7_fancy_title_css&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11897</link><description>The The7 — Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘ the7_fancy_title_css’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 12.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This is due to the plugin exposing Zoom SDK secret keys in client-side JavaScript within the meeting view template. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the sdk_secret value, which should remain server-side, compromising the security of the Zoom integration and allowing attackers to generate valid JWT signatures for unauthorized meeting access.</description><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 02:27:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34502 | Shuffle Master Deck Mate 2 Missing Secure Boot</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34502</link><description>Deck Mate 2 lacks a verified secure-boot chain and runtime integrity validation for its controller and display modules. Without cryptographic boot verification, an attacker with physical access can modify or replace the bootloader, kernel, or filesystem and gain persistent code execution on reboot. This weakness allows long-term firmware tampering that survives power cycles. The vendor indicates that more recent firmware updates strengthen update-chain integrity and disable physical update ports to mitigate related attack avenues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:27:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34503 | Shuffle Master Deck Mate 1 Unauthenticated EEPROM Firmware Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34503</link><description>Deck Mate 1 executes firmware directly from an external EEPROM without verifying authenticity or integrity. An attacker with physical access can replace or reflash the EEPROM to run arbitrary code that persists across reboots. Because this design predates modern secure-boot or signed-update mechanisms, affected systems should be physically protected or retired from service. The vendor has not indicated that firmware updates are available for this legacy model.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:27:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34500 | Shuffle Master Deck Mate 2 Insecure Update Chain</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-34500</link><description>Deck Mate 2's firmware update mechanism accepts packages without cryptographic signature verification, encrypts them with a single hard-coded AES key shared across devices, and uses a truncated HMAC for integrity validation. Attackers with access to the update interface - typically via the unit's USB update port - can craft or modify firmware packages to execute arbitrary code as root, allowing persistent compromise of the device's integrity and deck randomization process. Physical or on-premises access remains the most likely attack path, though network-exposed or telemetry-enabled deployments could theoretically allow remote exploitation if misconfigured. The vendor confirmed that firmware updates have been issued to correct these update-chain weaknesses and that USB update access has been disabled on affected units.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:10:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12194 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Legion of the Bouncy Castle Inc.

crypto: af_alg - Fix incorrect boolean values in af_alg_ctx

Commit 1b34cbbf4f01 ("crypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in
af_alg_sendmsg") changed some fields from bool to 1-bit bitfields of
type u32.

However, some assignments to these fields, specifically 'more' and
'merge', assign values greater than 1.  These relied on C's implicit
conversion to bool, such that zero becomes false and nonzero becomes
true.

With a 1-bit bitfields of type u32 instead, mod 2 of the value is taken
instead, resulting in 0 being assigned in some cases when 1 was intended.

Fix this by restoring the bool type.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:36:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40023 | drm/xe/vf: Don&amp;#x27;t expose sysfs attributes not applicable for VFs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40023</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost: Take a reference on the task in struct vhost_task.

vhost_task_create() creates a task and keeps a reference to its
task_struct. That task may exit early via a signal and its task_struct
will be released.
A pending vhost_task_wake() will then attempt to wake the task and
access a task_struct which is no longer there.

Acquire a reference on the task_struct while creating the thread and
release the reference while the struct vhost_task itself is removed.
If the task exits early due to a signal, then the vhost_task_wake() will
still access a valid task_struct. The wake is safe and will be skipped
in this case.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:36:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53733 | net: sched: cls_u32: Undo tcf_bind_filter if u32_replace_hw_knode</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53733</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

On the netns cleanup path, __ip_vs_ftp_exit() may unregister ip_vs_ftp
before connections with valid cp-&gt;app pointers are flushed, leading to a
use-after-free.

Fix this by introducing a global `exiting_module` flag, set to true in
ip_vs_ftp_exit() before unregistering the pernet subsystem. In
__ip_vs_ftp_exit(), skip ip_vs_ftp unregister if called during netns
cleanup (when exiting_module is false) and defer it to
__ip_vs_cleanup_batch(), which unregisters all apps after all connections
are flushed. If called during module exit, unregister ip_vs_ftp
immediately.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:56:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40019 | crypto: essiv - Check ssize for decryption and in-place encryption</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40019</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This feature accepted user-supplied URLs without proper validation, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Additionally, the retrieved content was directly reflected in the HTTP response, enabling reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin user's browser context.

By tricking an administrator into accessing a crafted link, an attacker could force the server to fetch malicious content and reflect it into the admin’s browser, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution for UI manipulation or data exfiltration. While session cookies are protected with the HttpOnly flag, the XSS still poses a significant security risk.

Furthermore, SSRF can be used by a privileged user to query internal services, potentially aiding in internal network enumeration if the target endpoints are reachable from the affected product.</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:27:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-5605 | Authentication Bypass via URI Manipulation in Multiple WSO2 Products&amp;#x27; Management Console Leading to Partial Information Disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-5605</link><description>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Management Console of multiple WSO2 products.
