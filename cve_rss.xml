Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:32:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47287 | Tornado vulnerable to excessive logging caused by malformed multipart form data</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47287</link><description>Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround, risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:32:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4720 | SourceCodester Student Result Management System drop_student.php path traversal</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4720</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Student Result Management System 1.0.

By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`,  `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. In particular `GITHUB_TOKEN` which can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. The `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions is a major security concern—especially in public repositories—because it executes untrusted code from a PR, but with the context of the base repository, including access to its secrets.

In versions on the 2.x branch prior to commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0, owners of Modular Accounts can grant session keys (scoped external keys) to external parties and would use the allowlist module to restrict which external contracts can be accessed by the session key. There is a bug in the allowlist module in that we don't check for the `executeUserOp` -&gt; `execute` or `executeBatch` path, effectively allowing any session key to bypass any access control restrictions set on the session key. Session keys are able to access ERC20 and ERC721 token contracts amongst others, transferring all tokens from the account out andonfigure the permissions on external modules on session keys. They would be able to remove all restrictions set on themselves this way, or rotate the keys of other keys with higher privileges into keys that they control. Commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0 fixes this issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 19:47:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47788 | Missing Path Validation Enables Path Traversal in Controller.php</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47788</link><description>Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud IDE.

In versions up to and including 2.5.9, SQL injection occurs because the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php is not strictly filtered. Since admin/article_save.php can be accessed by ordinary registered users, this will cause SQL injection to occur when the registered site is enabled, resulting in the injection of the admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a fix exists.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 19:32:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47787 | Emlog Pro Contains a File Upload Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47787</link><description>Emlog is an open source website building system.

In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, the `slice()` builtin can elide side effects when the output length is 0, and the source bytestring is a builtin (`msg.data` or `&lt;address&gt;.code`). The reason is that for these source locations, the check that `length &gt;= 1` is skipped. The result is that a 0-length bytestring constructed with slice can be passed to `make_byte_array_copier`, which elides evaluation of its source argument when the max length is 0. The impact is that side effects in the `start` argument may be elided when the `length` argument is 0, e.g. `slice(msg.data, self.do_side_effect(), 0)`. The fix in pull request 4645 disallows any invocation of `slice()` with length 0, including for the ad hoc locations discussed in this advisory. The fix is expected to be part of version 0.4.2.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 17:50:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4709 | Campcodes Sales and Inventory System transaction_del.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4709</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Campcodes Sales and Inventory System 1.0.

In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b""`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b"" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b""`. The fix is available in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 17:31:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43853 | iwasm vulnerable to filesystem sandbox escape with symlink when using uvwasi feature</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43853</link><description>The WebAssembly Micro Runtime's (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface.

Versions prior to 14.2.24 and 15.1.6 have a race-condition vulnerability. This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 23:13:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45067 | Incorrect default permissions in some Intel(R) Gaudi(R) software installers before version 1.18 may allow an authenticated user to potential...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45067</link><description>Incorrect default permissions in some Intel(R) Gaudi(R) software installers before version 1.18 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 22:26:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29686 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29686</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the title parameter at /inform/InformManageController.java.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 21:47:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29688 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29688</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the title parameter at /daymanager/daymanageabilitycontroller.java.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 21:32:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29689 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29689</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the password parameter at /mail/MailController.java.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 21:32:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29690 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29690</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the outtype parameter at /address/AddrController.java.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 21:25:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-29691 | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-29691</link><description>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OA System before v2025.01.01 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the userName parameter at /login/LoginsController.java.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 21:25:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-44879 | WS-WN572HP3 V230525 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow in the component /www/cgi-bin/upload.cgi.

The primary risk is phishing attacks that can lead to credential theft—particularly if you enabled Clientless VPN.

There is no availability impact to GlobalProtect features or GlobalProtect users. Attackers cannot use this vulnerability to tamper with or modify contents or configurations of the GlobalProtect portal or gateways. The integrity impact of this vulnerability is limited to enabling an attacker to create phishing and credential-stealing links that appear to be hosted on the GlobalProtect portal.



For GlobalProtect users with Clientless VPN enabled, there is a limited impact on confidentiality due to inherent risks of Clientless VPN that facilitate credential theft. You can read more about this risk in the informational bulletin  PAN-SA-2025-0005 https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005   https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005 .

This behavior can be abused to fill the disk with garbage data (e.g. using /dev/urandom on Linux) or to leak Windows credentials via SMB links when the email is viewed in HTML mode. While user interaction is required to download the .pdf file, visual obfuscation can conceal the download trigger. Viewing the email in HTML mode is enough to load external content.

By crafting a nested email attachment (message/rfc822) and setting its content type to application/pdf, Thunderbird may incorrectly render it as HTML when opened, allowing the embedded JavaScript to run without requiring a file download. This behavior relies on Thunderbird auto-saving the attachment to /tmp and linking to it via the file:/// protocol, potentially enabling JavaScript execution as part of the HTML.

Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address. All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user's email address they used to register on the app, they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe, the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time, and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:01:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47777 | 5ire Client Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote Code Execution (RCE)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47777</link><description>5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client.

A vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption.

This issue affects Apache ORC C++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 13:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53146 | media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-53146</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()

In dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf
is null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be
passed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing
msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.
We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.

Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers. However, it misses authentication and authorization checks, allowing every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with capabilities to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages. 

This flaw allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages. This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to access and modify sensitive system data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 11:59:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47445 | WordPress Eventin &amp;lt;= 4.0.26 - Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47445</link><description>Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Themewinter Eventin allows Path Traversal.This issue affects Eventin: from n/a through 4.0.26.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 11:45:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3769 | Latepoint &amp;lt;= 5.1.92 - Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3769</link><description>The LatePoint – Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.92 via the 'view_booking_summary_in_lightbox' due to missing validation on a user controlled key.

Starting in the 7.x branch and prior to versions 13.4.2 and 15.1.2, the 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address, potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems. This issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2. Unpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the `Send email with template (Razor)` workflow instead or writing a custom workflow type. To avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using a composer available in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:12:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36339 | A DLL hijacking vulnerability in the AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries could allow an attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially resul...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36339</link><description>A DLL hijacking vulnerability in the AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries could allow an attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:12:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6364 | Server Identity Validation Bypass in Absolute Persistence®</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6364</link><description>A vulnerability in Absolute Persistence® versions before 2.8 exists when it is not activated.

In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 16:19:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45857 | EDIMAX CV7428NS v1.20 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the command parameter in the mp function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45857</link><description>EDIMAX CV7428NS v1.20 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the command parameter in the mp function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4427 | Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4427</link><description>An authentication bypass in the API component of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile 12.5.0.0 and prior allows attackers to access protected resources without proper credentials via the API.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4428 | Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4428</link><description>Remote Code Execution in API component in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile 12.5.0.0 and prior on unspecified platforms allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted API requests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47276 | Actualizer Uses OpenSSL&amp;#x27;s  &amp;quot;-passwd&amp;quot; Function Which Uses SHA512 Under The Hood Instead of Proper Password Hasher like Yescript/Argon2i</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47276</link><description>Actualizer is a single shell script solution to allow developers and embedded engineers to create Debian operating systems (OS). Prior to version 1.2.0, Actualizer uses OpenSSL's  "-passwd" function, which uses SHA512 instead of a more suitable password hasher like Yescript/Argon2i. All Actualizer users building a full Debian Operating System are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.2.0 of Actualizer. Existing OS deployment requires manual password changes against the alpha and root accounts. The change will deploy's Debian's yescript overriding the older SHA512 hash created by OpenSSL. As a workaround, users need to reset both `root` and "Alpha" users' passwords.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:50:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46506 | NetAlertX 23.01.14 through 24.x before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated command injection via settings update because function=savesettings l...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46506</link><description>NetAlertX 23.01.14 through 24.x before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated command injection via settings update because function=savesettings lacks an authentication requirement, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby-&gt;collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby-&gt;collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have added a check for the collection path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured collections root. Collection paths that point outside of the collections root will not be loaded.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45858 | TOTOLINK A3002R v4.0.0-B20230531.1404 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the FUN_00459fdc function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45858</link><description>TOTOLINK A3002R v4.0.0-B20230531.1404 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the FUN_00459fdc function.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46721 | nosurf vulnerable to CSRF due to non-functional same-origin request checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46721</link><description>nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:40:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-48766 | NetAlertX 24.7.18 before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated file reading because an HTTP client can ignore a redirect, and because of factors r...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48766</link><description>NetAlertX 24.7.18 before 24.10.12 allows unauthenticated file reading because an HTTP client can ignore a redirect, and because of factors related to strpos and directory traversal.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby setups that use PHP's built-in server. Such setups are commonly only used during local development. Sites that use other server software (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine whether the file exists or not.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22460 | Default credentials in Ivanti Cloud Services Application before version 5.0.5 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22460</link><description>Default credentials in Ivanti Cloud Services Application before version 5.0.5 allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28057 | owl-admin v3.2.2~ to v4.10.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /admin-api/system/admin_menus/save_order.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28057</link><description>owl-admin v3.2.2~ to v4.10.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection in /admin-api/system/admin_menus/save_order.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 15:25:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30159 | Kirby vulnerable to path traversal of snippet names in the `snippet()` helper</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30159</link><description>Kirby is an open-source content management system.
