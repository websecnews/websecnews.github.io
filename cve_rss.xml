A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 19:28:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31481 | GraphQL query operations security can be bypassed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31481</link><description>API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs.

drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()

On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via
ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and
first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

proc: fix UAF in proc_get_inode()

Fix race between rmmod and /proc/XXX's inode instantiation.

The bug is that pde-&gt;proc_ops don't belong to /proc, it belongs to a
module, therefore dereferencing it after /proc entry has been registered
is a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.

use_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde-&gt;proc_ops
never changes so information necessary for inode instantiation can be
saved _before_ proc_register() in PDE itself and used later, avoiding
pde-&gt;proc_ops-&gt;...  dereference.

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae ("can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload-&gt;raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload-&gt;fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:32:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22004 | net: atm: fix use after free in lec_send()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22004</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh-&gt;nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh-&gt;rt6i_pcpu, resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22006 | net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22006</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. 
The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 01:14:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3123 | WonderCMS Theme Installation/Plugin Installation installUpdateModuleAction unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3123</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in WonderCMS 3.5.0.

However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party.

A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -&gt; Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31477 | Improper Scope Validation in the open Endpoint of  tauri-plugin-shell</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31477</link><description>The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31479 | canonical/get-workflow-version-action can leak a partial GITHUB_TOKEN in exception output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31479</link><description>canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3129 | Access code - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2025-028</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3129</link><description>Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability in Drupal Access code allows Brute Force.This issue affects Access code: from 0.0.0 before 2.0.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3130 | Obfuscate - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2025-029</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3130</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal Obfuscate allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Obfuscate: from 0.0.0 before 2.0.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2704 | OpenVPN version 2.6.1 through 2.6.13 in server mode using TLS-crypt-v2 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service by corrupting ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2704</link><description>OpenVPN version 2.6.1 through 2.6.13 in server mode using TLS-crypt-v2 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service by corrupting and replaying network packets in the early handshake phase</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:13:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3118 | SourceCodester Online Tutor Portal view_course.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3118</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Tutor Portal 1.0.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid VPN user credentials on the affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because a variable is not initialized when an SSL VPN session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted attributes while establishing an SSL VPN session with an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  "Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes."

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a "first CPU".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y
  index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]'
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   dump_stack
   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds
   load_microcode_amd
   request_microcode_amd
   reload_store
   kernfs_fop_write_iter
   vfs_write
   ksys_write
   do_syscall_64
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining
whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.

/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix
length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not
apply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:15:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30090 | mime.php in SquirrelMail through 1.4.23-svn-20250401 and 1.5.x through 1.5.2-svn-20250401 allows XSS via e-mail headers, because JavaScript ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30090</link><description>mime.php in SquirrelMail through 1.4.23-svn-20250401 and 1.5.x through 1.5.2-svn-20250401 allows XSS via e-mail headers, because JavaScript payloads are mishandled after $encoded has been set to true.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:15:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21987 | drm/amdgpu: init return value in amdgpu_ttm_clear_buffer</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21987</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When the Jaeger UI Monitor Tab functionality is enabled in a Tempo instance managed by the Tempo Operator, the Operator creates a ClusterRoleBinding for the Service Account of the Tempo instance to grant the cluster-monitoring-view ClusterRole.
This can be exploited if a user has 'create' permissions on TempoStack and 'get' permissions on Secret in a namespace (for example, a user has ClusterAdmin permissions for a specific namespace), as the user can read the token of the Tempo service account and therefore has access to see all cluster metrics.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:24:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2786 | Tempo-operator: serviceaccount token exposure leading to token and subject access reviews in openshift tempo operator</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2786</link><description>A flaw was found in Tempo Operator, where it creates a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance.

Prior to 1.6.7, when ProxyOn is enabled, the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times, with later invocations overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 22:16:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-46988 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in ONLYOFFICE Document Server v.7.5.0 and before allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46988</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in ONLYOFFICE Document Server v.7.5.0 and before allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via a crafted file upload.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:44:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2003-20001 | An issue was discovered on Mitel ICP VoIP 3100 devices.

mm: fix kernel BUG when userfaultfd_move encounters swapcache

userfaultfd_move() checks whether the PTE entry is present or a
swap entry.

- If the PTE entry is present, move_present_pte() handles folio
  migration by setting:

  src_folio-&gt;index = linear_page_index(dst_vma, dst_addr);

- If the PTE entry is a swap entry, move_swap_pte() simply copies
  the PTE to the new dst_addr.

This approach is incorrect because, even if the PTE is a swap entry,
it can still reference a folio that remains in the swap cache.

This creates a race window between steps 2 and 4.
 1. add_to_swap: The folio is added to the swapcache.
 2. try_to_unmap: PTEs are converted to swap entries.
 3. pageout: The folio is written back.
 4. Swapcache is cleared.
If userfaultfd_move() occurs in the window between steps 2 and 4,
after the swap PTE has been moved to the destination, accessing the
destination triggers do_swap_page(), which may locate the folio in
the swapcache. However, since the folio's index has not been updated
to match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.

This can result in two critical issues depending on the system
configuration.

If KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG
during the add_rmap operation due to:

 page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address)

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT &amp; HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:55:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21986 | net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21986</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the "blocking" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

acpi: typec: ucsi: Introduce a -&gt;poll_cci method

For the ACPI backend of UCSI the UCSI "registers" are just a memory copy
of the register values in an opregion. The ACPI implementation in the
BIOS ensures that the opregion contents are synced to the embedded
controller and it ensures that the registers (in particular CCI) are
synced back to the opregion on notifications. While there is an ACPI call
that syncs the actual registers to the opregion there is rarely a need to
do this and on some ACPI implementations it actually breaks in various
interesting ways.

The only reason to force a sync from the embedded controller is to poll
CCI while notifications are disabled. Only the ucsi core knows if this
is the case and guessing based on the current command is suboptimal, i.e.
leading to the following spurious assertion splat:

WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 76 at drivers/usb/typec/ucsi/ucsi.c:1388 ucsi_reset_ppm+0x1b4/0x1c0 [typec_ucsi]

Thus introduce a -&gt;poll_cci() method that works like -&gt;read_cci() with an
additional forced sync and document that this should be used when polling
with notifications disabled. For all other backends that presumably don't
have this issue use the same implementation for both methods.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21903 | mctp i3c: handle NULL header address</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21903</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

del_vqs() frees virtqueues, therefore cfv-&gt;vq_tx pointer should be checked

is redundant because the pointer cfv-&gt;vdev is dereferenced before it is
checked for NULL.

Fix this by checking cfv-&gt;vq_tx for NULL instead of cfv-&gt;vdev before
calling del_vqs().</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21905 | wifi: iwlwifi: limit printed string from FW file</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21905</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

There's no guarantee here that the file is always with a
NUL-termination, so reading the string may read beyond the

perhaps even read beyond the end of the file buffer.

Fix that by limiting the print format to the size of the

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: clean up ROC on failure

If the firmware fails to start the session protection, then we
do call iwl_mvm_roc_finished() here, but that won't do anything
at all because IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING was never set.
Set IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING in the failure/stop path.
If it started successfully before, it's already set, so that
doesn't matter, and if it didn't start it needs to be set to
clean up.

Not doing so will lead to a WARN_ON() later on a fresh remain-
on-channel, since the link is already active when activated as
it was never deactivated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21907 | mm: memory-failure: update ttu flag inside unmap_poisoned_folio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21907</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: memory-failure: update ttu flag inside unmap_poisoned_folio

Patch series "mm: memory_failure: unmap poisoned folio during migrate
properly", v3.

Fix two bugs during folio migration if the folio is poisoned.


This patch (of 3):

Commit 6da6b1d4a7df ("mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to
TTU_HWPOISON") introduce TTU_HWPOISON to replace TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON in
order to stop send SIGBUS signal when accessing an error page after a
memory error on a clean folio.  However during page migration, anon folio
must be set with TTU_HWPOISON during unmap_*().  For pagecache we need
some policy just like the one in hwpoison_user_mappings to set this flag. 
So move this policy from hwpoison_user_mappings to unmap_poisoned_folio to
handle this warning properly.

Warning will be produced during unamp poison folio with the following log:

Otherwise NFS can deadlock waiting for kcompactd enduced writeback which

wifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flags

It is possible to set both MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES and MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVE
flags simultaneously on the same monitor interface from the userspace. This
causes a sub-interface to be created with no IEEE80211_SDATA_IN_DRIVER bit
set because the monitor interface is in the cooked state and it takes
precedence over all other states. When the interface is then being deleted
the kernel calls WARN_ONCE() from check_sdata_in_driver() because of missing
that bit.

Fix this by rejecting MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES if it is set along with
other flags.

wifi: cfg80211: regulatory: improve invalid hints checking

Syzbot keeps reporting an issue [1] that occurs when erroneous symbols
sent from userspace get through into user_alpha2[] via
regulatory_hint_user() call. Such invalid regulatory hints should be
rejected.

While a sanity check from commit 47caf685a685 ("cfg80211: regulatory:
reject invalid hints") looks to be enough to deter these very cases,
there is a way to get around it due to 2 reasons.

1) The way isalpha() works, symbols other than latin lower and
upper letters may be used to determine a country/domain.
For instance, greek letters will also be considered upper/lower
letters and for such characters isalpha() will return true as well.
However, ISO-3166-1 alpha2 codes should only hold latin
characters.

2) While processing a user regulatory request, between
reg_process_hint_user() and regulatory_hint_user() there happens to
be a call to queue_regulatory_request() which modifies letters in
request-&gt;alpha2[] with toupper(). This works fine for latin symbols,
less so for weird letter characters from the second part of _ctype[].

Syzbot triggers a warning in is_user_regdom_saved() by first sending
over an unexpected non-latin letter that gets malformed by toupper()
into a character that ends up failing isalpha() check.

Prevent this by enhancing is_an_alpha2() to ensure that incoming
symbols are latin letters and nothing else.

cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()

Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c

This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW, which
includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store().
These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.

The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to
update the driver_override value, and driver_set_override() internally
locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads
cdx_dev-&gt;driver_override without locking, it could potentially access
a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string
concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address, which is a
security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.

Additionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well
as many other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show
function, and it has been working without issues.

This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis
tool, which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify
data races and atomicity violations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21916 | usb: atm: cxacru: fix a flaw in existing endpoint checks</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21916</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: atm: cxacru: fix a flaw in existing endpoint checks

Syzbot once again identified a flaw in usb endpoint checking, see [1].
This time the issue stems from a commit authored by me (2eabb655a968
("usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()")).

While using usb_find_common_endpoints() may usually be enough to
discard devices with wrong endpoints, in this case one needs more
than just finding and identifying the sufficient number of endpoints
of correct types - one needs to check the endpoint's address as well.

Since cxacru_bind() fills URBs with CXACRU_EP_CMD address in mind,
switch the endpoint verification approach to usb_check_XXX_endpoints()
instead to fix incomplete ep testing.

sched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list

child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.
This 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,
making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory
corruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and
the task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory
fault or access garbage data.

The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both
cfs_rq-&gt;leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq-&gt;leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same
leaf list. Also, rq-&gt;tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq-&gt;leaf_cfs_rq_list.

This adds a check `if (prev == &amp;amp;rq-&gt;leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main
conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of
operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.

This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added
to the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list
head is enough.

Fixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct
layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable
behavior when the layout changes.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21920 | vlan: enforce underlying device type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21920</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vlan: enforce underlying device type

Currently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.

Besides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a
bug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.

When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)
and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.

As part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of
each applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.

__dev_mc_add uses dev-&gt;addr_len to determine the length of the new
multicast address.

This causes an out-of-bounds read if dev-&gt;addr_len is greater than 6,
since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6
bytes long.

This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:

ip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo
ip l set up dev gretest
ip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100

Then, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:

ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21

Fix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLAN
device initialization.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21921 | net: ethtool: netlink: Allow NULL nlattrs when getting a phy_device</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21921</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethtool: netlink: Allow NULL nlattrs when getting a phy_device

ethnl_req_get_phydev() is used to lookup a phy_device, in the case an
ethtool netlink command targets a specific phydev within a netdev's
topology.

It takes as a parameter a const struct nlattr *header that's used for
error handling :

       if (!phydev) {
               NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR(extack, header,
                                   "no phy matching phyindex");
               return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
       }

In the notify path after a -&gt;set operation however, there's no request
attributes available.

The typical callsite for the above function looks like:

	phydev = ethnl_req_get_phydev(req_base, tb[ETHTOOL_A_XXX_HEADER],
				      info-&gt;extack);

So, when tb is NULL (such as in the ethnl notify path), we have a nice
crash.

It turns out that there's only the PLCA command that is in that case, as
the other phydev-specific commands don't have a notification.

This commit fixes the crash by passing the cmd index and the nlattr
array separately, allowing NULL-checking it directly inside the helper.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21922 | ppp: Fix KMSAN uninit-value warning with bpf</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21922</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppp: Fix KMSAN uninit-value warning with bpf

Syzbot caught an "KMSAN: uninit-value" warning [1], which is caused by the
ppp driver not initializing a 2-byte header when using socket filter.

The following code can generate a PPP filter BPF program:
'''
struct bpf_program fp;
pcap_t *handle;
handle = pcap_open_dead(DLT_PPP_PPPD, 65535);
pcap_compile(handle, &amp;amp;fp, "ip and outbound", 0, 0);
bpf_dump(&amp;amp;fp, 1);
'''
Its output is:
'''
(000) ldh [2]
(001) jeq #0x21 jt 2 jf 5
(002) ldb [0]
(003) jeq #0x1 jt 4 jf 5
(004) ret #65535
(005) ret #0
'''
Wen can find similar code at the following link:
https://github.com/ppp-project/ppp/blob/master/pppd/options.c#L1680
The maintainer of this code repository is also the original maintainer
of the ppp driver.

As you can see the BPF program skips 2 bytes of data and then reads the
'Protocol' field to determine if it's an IP packet. Then it read the first
byte of the first 2 bytes to determine the direction.

The issue is that only the first byte indicating direction is initialized
in current ppp driver code while the second byte is not initialized.

For normal BPF programs generated by libpcap, uninitialized data won't be
used, so it's not a problem. However, for carefully crafted BPF programs,
such as those generated by syzkaller [2], which start reading from offset
0, the uninitialized data will be used and caught by KMSAN.

Simply replace skb_get() by skb_clone() in net/llc/llc_s_ac.c

Note that e1000 driver might have an issue with pktgen,
because it does not clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING, this is an

mm: abort vma_modify() on merge out of memory failure

The remainder of vma_modify() relies upon the vmg state remaining pristine
after a merge attempt.

Usually this is the case, however in the one edge case scenario of a merge
attempt failing not due to the specified range being unmergeable, but
rather due to an out of memory error arising when attempting to commit the
merge, this assumption becomes untrue.

This results in vmg-&gt;start, end being modified, and thus the proceeding
attempts to split the VMA will be done with invalid start/end values.

Thankfully, it is likely practically impossible for us to hit this in
reality, as it would require a maple tree node pre-allocation failure that
would likely never happen due to it being 'too small to fail', i.e.  the
kernel would simply keep retrying reclaim until it succeeded.

However, this scenario remains theoretically possible, and what we are
doing here is wrong so we must correct it.

The safest option is, when this scenario occurs, to simply give up the
operation.  If we cannot allocate memory to merge, then we cannot allocate
memory to split either (perhaps moreso!).

Any scenario where this would be happening would be under very extreme
(likely fatal) memory pressure, so it's best we give up early.

So there is no doubt it is appropriate to simply bail out in this
scenario.

However, in general we must if at all possible never assume VMG state is
stable after a merge attempt, since merge operations update VMG fields. 
As a result, additionally also make this clear by storing start, end in
local variables.

The issue was reported originally by syzkaller, and by Brad Spengler (via
an off-list discussion), and in both instances it manifested as a
triggering of the assert:

	VM_WARN_ON_VMG(start &gt;= end, vmg);

In vma_merge_existing_range().

It seems at least one scenario in which this is occurring is one in which
the merge being attempted is due to an madvise() across multiple VMAs
which looks like this:

        start     end
          |&lt;------&gt;|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

When madvise_walk_vmas() is invoked, we first find vma in the above
(determining prev to be equal to vma as we are offset into vma), and then
enter the loop.

We determine the end of vma that forms part of the range we are
madvise()'ing by setting 'tmp' to this value:

		/* Here vma-&gt;vm_start &lt;= start &lt; (end|vma-&gt;vm_end) */
		tmp = vma-&gt;vm_end;

We then invoke the madvise() operation via visit(), letting prev get
updated to point to vma as part of the operation:

		/* Here vma-&gt;vm_start &lt;= start &lt; tmp &lt;= (end|vma-&gt;vm_end). */
		error = visit(vma, &amp;amp;prev, start, tmp, arg);

Where the visit() function pointer in this instance is
madvise_vma_behavior().

As observed in syzkaller reports, it is ultimately madvise_update_vma()
that is invoked, calling vma_modify_flags_name() and vma_modify() in turn.

Then, in vma_modify(), we attempt the merge:

	merged = vma_merge_existing_range(vmg);
	if (merged)
		return merged;

We invoke this with vmg-&gt;start, end set to start, tmp as such:

        start  tmp
          |&lt;---&gt;|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

We find ourselves in the merge right scenario, but the one in which we
cannot remove the middle (we are offset into vma).

Here we have a special case where vmg-&gt;start, end get set to perhaps
unintuitive values - we intended to shrink the middle VMA and expand the
next.

This means vmg-&gt;start, end are set to...  vma-&gt;vm_start, start.

Now the commit_merge() fails, and vmg-&gt;start, end are left like this. 
This means we return to the rest of vma_modify() with vmg-&gt;start, end
(here denoted as start', end') set as:

  start' end'
     |&lt;--&gt;|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

So we now erroneously try to split accordingly.  This is where the
unfortunate

To fix it, do not rely on whether 'ptl' is equal to decide whether to hold
the pte lock, but decide it by whether CONFIG_SPLIT_PTE_PTLOCKS is
enabled.  In addition, if two vmas map to the same PTE page, there is no
need to hold the pte lock again, otherwise a deadlock will occur.  Just
add the need_lock parameter to let adjust_pte() know this information.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21934 | rapidio: fix an API misues when rio_add_net() fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21934</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

If multiple connection requests attempt to create an implicit mptcp
endpoint in parallel, more than one caller may end up in
mptcp_pm_nl_append_new_local_addr because none found the address in
local_addr_list during their call to mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id.  In this
case, the concurrent new_local_addr calls may delete the address entry
created by the previous caller.  These deletes use synchronize_rcu, but
this is not permitted in some of the contexts where this function may be
called.  During packet recv, the caller may be in a rcu read critical
section and have preemption disabled.

This problem seems particularly prevalent if the user advertises an
endpoint that has a different external vs internal address.  In the case
where the external address is advertised and multiple connections
already exist, multiple subflow SYNs arrive in parallel which tends to
trigger the race during creation of the first local_addr_list entries
which have the internal address instead.

Fix by skipping the replacement of an existing implicit local address if
called via mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21939 | drm/xe/hmm: Don&amp;#x27;t dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21939</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/hmm: Don't dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock

The pnfs that we obtain from hmm_range_fault() point to pages that
we don't have a reference on, and the guarantee that they are still
in the cpu page-tables is that the notifier lock must be held and the
notifier seqno is still valid.

So while building the sg table and marking the pages accesses / dirty
we need to hold this lock with a validated seqno.

However, the lock is reclaim tainted which makes
sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() unusable, since it internally
allocates memory.

Instead build the sg-table manually. For the non-iommu case
this might lead to fewer coalesces, but if that's a problem it can
be fixed up later in the resource cursor code. For the iommu case,
the whole sg-table may still be coalesced to a single contigous
device va region.

This avoids marking pages that we don't own dirty and accessed, and
it also avoid dereferencing struct pages that we don't own.

v2:
- Use assert to check whether hmm pfns are valid (Matthew Auld)
- Take into account that large pages may cross range boundaries
  (Matthew Auld)

v3:
- Don't unnecessarily check for a non-freed sg-table. (Matthew Auld)
- Add a missing up_read() in an error path. (Matthew Auld)

This happens because we have another success path for the zoned mode. When
there is no active zone available, btrfs_reserve_extent() returns
-EAGAIN. In this case, we have two reactions.

(1) If the given range is never allocated, we can only wait for someone
    to finish a zone, so wait on BTRFS_FS_NEED_ZONE_FINISH bit and retry
    afterward.

(2) Or, if some allocations are already done, we must bail out and let
    the caller to send IOs for the allocation. This is because these IOs
    may be necessary to finish a zone.

The commit 06f364284794 ("btrfs: do proper folio cleanup when
cow_file_range() failed") moved the unlock code from the inside of the
loop to the outside. So, previously, the allocated extents are unlocked
just after the allocation and so before returning from the function.
However, they are no longer unlocked on the case (2) above. That caused
the hang issue.

Fix the issue by modifying the 'end' to the end of the allocated
range. Then, we can exit the loop and the same unlock code can properly
handle the case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21943 | gpio: aggregator: protect driver attr handlers against module unload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21943</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: aggregator: protect driver attr handlers against module unload

Both new_device_store and delete_device_store touch module global
resources (e.g. gpio_aggregator_lock). To prevent race conditions with
module unload, a reference needs to be held.

Add try_module_get() in these handlers.

For new_device_store, this eliminates what appears to be the most dangerous
scenario: if an id is allocated from gpio_aggregator_idr but
platform_device_register has not yet been called or completed, a concurrent
module unload could fail to unregister/delete the device, leaving behind a
dangling platform device/GPIO forwarder. This can result in various issues.
The following simple reproducer demonstrates these problems:

  #!/bin/bash
  while :; do
    # note: whether 'gpiochip0 0' exists or not does not matter.
    echo 'gpiochip0 0' &gt; /sys/bus/platform/drivers/gpio-aggregator/new_device
  done &amp;
  while :; do
    modprobe gpio-aggregator
    modprobe -r gpio-aggregator
  done &amp;
  wait

This happens due to the malformed report items sent by the emulated device
which results in a report, that has no fields, being added to the report list.
Due to this appleir_input_configured() is never called, hidinput_connect()
fails which results in the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag is not being set. However,
it  does not make appleir_probe() fail and lets the event callback to be
called without the associated input device.

Thus, add a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag and leave the event hook
early if the driver didn't claim any input_dev for some reason. Moreover,
some other hid drivers accessing input_dev in their event callbacks do have
similar checks, too.

bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock

There are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled
asynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits
synchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during
the PM shutdown() callback.

If the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the
device using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the
device_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock
has already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while
waiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller
which waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to
deadlock.

This is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died
before shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()
callback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.

And this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during
the PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the
device_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the
recovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also
observed on the X1E80100 CRD.

So to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This
function first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before
trying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it
and reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,
recovery_work will fail with the error message "Recovery failed" as not
much could be done.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21952 | HID: corsair-void: Update power supply values with a unified work handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21952</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netmem: prevent TX of unreadable skbs

Currently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not
TX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet
into the device's TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on
dma addrs that should not be passed to it.

Fix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs.

Tested by configuring tc redirect:

sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress
sudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \
	tcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1

Before, I see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs.

After, I don't see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21955 | ksmbd: prevent connection release during oplock break notification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21955</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[WHY &amp; HOW]
A warning message "WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397
calculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu]" occurs because the
display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is
observed in Radeon RX 6600 XT.

It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.

Also fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.

Revert "openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack"

Currently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only called for confirmed conntrack
entries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack entry
does not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in
ovs_ct_get_conn_labels() for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in
nf_ct_ext_add():

  WARN_ON(nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct));

This happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS
increments net-&gt;ct.labels_used. The issue has become more likely since
commit fcb1aa5163b1 ("openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting
in conntrack"), which changed to use per-action label counting and
increment net-&gt;ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.

Since there’s no straightforward way to fully resolve this issue at the
moment, this reverts the commit to avoid breaking existing use cases.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21959 | netfilter: nf_conncount: Fully initialize struct nf_conncount_tuple in insert_tree()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21959</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_conncount: Fully initialize struct nf_conncount_tuple in insert_tree()

Since commit b36e4523d4d5 ("netfilter: nf_conncount: fix garbage
collection confirm race"), `cpu` and `jiffies32` were introduced to
the struct nf_conncount_tuple.

The commit made nf_conncount_add() initialize `conn-&gt;cpu` and
`conn-&gt;jiffies32` when allocating the struct.
In contrast, count_tree() was not changed to initialize them.

By commit 34848d5c896e ("netfilter: nf_conncount: Split insert and
traversal"), count_tree() was split and the relevant allocation
code now resides in insert_tree().
Initialize `conn-&gt;cpu` and `conn-&gt;jiffies32` in insert_tree().

eth: bnxt: do not update checksum in bnxt_xdp_build_skb()

The bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value at the end if checksum offload
is enabled.
When the XDP-MB program is attached and it returns XDP_PASS, the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is called to update skb_shared_info.
The main purpose of bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is to update skb_shared_info,
but it updates ip_summed value too if checksum offload is enabled.
This is actually duplicate work.

When the bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value, it checks if ip_summed
is CHECKSUM_NONE or not.
It means that ip_summed should be CHECKSUM_NONE at this moment.
But ip_summed may already be updated to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY in the
XDP-MB-PASS path.
So the by skb_checksum_none_assert() WARNS about it.

This is duplicate work and updating ip_summed in the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is not needed.

eth: bnxt: fix truesize for mb-xdp-pass case

When mb-xdp is set and return is XDP_PASS, packet is converted from
xdp_buff to sk_buff with xdp_update_skb_shared_info() in
bnxt_xdp_build_skb().
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() passes incorrect truesize argument to
xdp_update_skb_shared_info().
The truesize is calculated as BNXT_RX_PAGE_SIZE * sinfo-&gt;nr_frags but
the skb_shared_info was wiped by napi_build_skb() before.
So it stores sinfo-&gt;nr_frags before bnxt_xdp_build_skb() and use it
instead of getting skb_shared_info from xdp_get_shared_info_from_buff().

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check

When removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is
triggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the
offloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns
false if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,
mlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of
the alive PF, and the flush is skipped.

Besides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge
event handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be
ignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,
and the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.

To make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue
keeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge
notifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond
netdev which is already destroyed.

To fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in
commit 15f8f168952f ("net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding
bond to bridge"), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes
invalid state after initialization.

net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT
(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21972 | net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21972</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling

Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other
packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and
prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and
their skb_shared_info.

The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the
problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.

A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21973 | eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21973</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}

When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops
are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats
from sw_stats in the rings.
But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up.
So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down.

The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However,
the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring
without null check.
So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down.

Reproducer:
 ip link set $interface down
 ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get
OR
 ip link set $interface down
 python ./stats.py

eth: bnxt: return fail if interface is down in bnxt_queue_mem_alloc()

The bnxt_queue_mem_alloc() is called to allocate new queue memory when
a queue is restarted.
It internally accesses rx buffer descriptor corresponding to the index.
The rx buffer descriptor is allocated and set when the interface is up
and it's freed when the interface is down.
So, if queue is restarted if interface is down, kernel panic occurs.

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Fix hang in kdump kernel when on Hyper-V Gen 2 VMs

Gen 2 Hyper-V VMs boot via EFI and have a standard EFI framebuffer
device. When the kdump kernel runs in such a VM, loading the efifb
driver may hang because of accessing the framebuffer at the wrong
memory address.

The scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel
moves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts
with an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver
then informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB
VMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump
kernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the
system call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the
kdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition
to the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V
does not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.
When efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer
address, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,
the Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles
the guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.

When the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()
system call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command
builds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned
by the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the
new framebuffer location.

This problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a ("hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old
framebuffer"). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA
to 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb
driver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit
c25a19afb81c ("fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info")
effectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference
to 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications
that were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit
c25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.

Interestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because
it never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm
driver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO
address, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers
*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the "after" ordering, hyperv_fb
may encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO
address. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed
a few lines of code later.

Rather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so
conflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.
Then the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and
there's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump
kernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by
the Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm
driver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of
the module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().

This approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()
is used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and
rebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving
back to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there
are no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is
loaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again
have the wrong address.

This problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but
it can also occur

drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removed

When a Hyper-V DRM device is probed, the driver allocates MMIO space for
the vram, and maps it cacheable. If the device removed, or in the error
path for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.
Consequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.

Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in the
error path during device probing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:48:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21979 | wifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21979</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Syskaller triggers a warning due to prev_epc-&gt;pmu != next_epc-&gt;pmu in
perf_event_swap_task_ctx_data(). vmcore shows that two lists have the same
perf_event_pmu_context, but not in the same order.

The problem is that the order of pmu_ctx_list for the parent is impacted by
the time when an event/PMU is added. While the order for a child is
impacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups. So
the order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.

To fix this problem, insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place
after iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.

The follow testcase can trigger above warning:

 # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 3 ./a.out &amp;
 # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out

 test.c

 void main() {
        int count = 0;
        pid_t pid;

        printf("%d running\n", getpid());
        sleep(30);
        printf("running\n");

        pid = fork();
        if (pid == -1) {
                printf("fork error\n");
                return;
        }
        if (pid == 0) {
                while (1) {
                        count++;
                }
        } else {
                while (1) {
                        count++;
                }
        }
 }

The testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data,
and then open tracepoint and software events, so the parent context will
have 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts. On inheritance, child ctx will
insert the perf_event_pmu_context in another order and the warning will
trigger.

fuse: revert back to __readahead_folio() for readahead

In commit 3eab9d7bc2f4 ("fuse: convert readahead to use folios"), the
logic was converted to using the new folio readahead code, which drops
the reference on the folio once it is locked, using an inferred
reference on the folio. Previously we held a reference on the folio for
the entire duration of the readpages call.

This is fine, however for the case for splice pipe responses where we
will remove the old folio and splice in the new folio (see
fuse_try_move_page()), we assume that there is a reference held on the
folio for ap-&gt;folios, which is no longer the case.

To fix this, revert back to __readahead_folio() which allows us to hold
the reference on the folio for the duration of readpages until either we
drop the reference ourselves in fuse_readpages_end() or the reference is
dropped after it's replaced in the page cache in the splice case.
This will fix the UAF bug that was reported.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:39:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21897 | sched_ext: Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when it&amp;#x27;s called without balance()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21897</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when it's called without balance()

a6250aa251ea ("sched_ext: Handle cases where pick_task_scx() is called
without preceding balance_scx()") added a workaround to handle the cases
where pick_task_scx() is called without prececing balance_scx() which is due
to a fair class bug where pick_taks_fair() may return NULL after a true
return from balance_fair().

The workaround detects when pick_task_scx() is called without preceding
balance_scx() and emulates SCX_RQ_BAL_KEEP and triggers kicking to avoid
stalling. Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was
on SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the
task may be on SCX but no longer runnable.

This could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()
which cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode
is the task ending up with (!on_rq &amp;&amp; on_cpu) state which can cause
potential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.

Fix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes
@prev_on_scx only used in one place. Open code the usage and improve the
comment while at it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:39:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21898 | ftrace: Avoid potential division by zero in function_stat_show()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21898</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix bad hist from corrupting named_triggers list

The following commands causes a crash:

 ~# cd /sys/kernel/tracing/events/rcu/rcu_callback
 ~# echo 'hist:name=bad:keys=common_pid:onmax(bogus).save(common_pid)' &gt; trigger
 bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
 ~# echo 'hist:name=bad:keys=common_pid' &gt; trigger

Because the following occurs:

event_trigger_write() {
  trigger_process_regex() {
    event_hist_trigger_parse() {

      data = event_trigger_alloc(..);

      event_trigger_register(.., data) {
        cmd_ops-&gt;reg(.., data, ..) [hist_register_trigger()] {
          data-&gt;ops-&gt;init() [event_hist_trigger_init()] {
            save_named_trigger(name, data) {
              list_add(&amp;amp;data-&gt;named_list, &amp;amp;named_triggers);
            }
          }
        }
      }

      ret = create_actions(); (return -EINVAL)
      if (ret)
        goto out_unreg;
[..]
      ret = hist_trigger_enable(data, ...) {
        list_add_tail_rcu(&amp;amp;data-&gt;list, &amp;amp;file-&gt;triggers); &lt;&lt;&lt;---- SKIPPED!!! (this is important!)
[..]
 out_unreg:
      event_hist_unregister(.., data) {
        cmd_ops-&gt;unreg(.., data, ..) [hist_unregister_trigger()] {
          list_for_each_entry(iter, &amp;amp;file-&gt;triggers, list) {
            if (!hist_trigger_match(data, iter, named_data, false))   &lt;- never matches
                continue;
            [..]
            test = iter;
          }
          if (test &amp;&amp; test-&gt;ops-&gt;free) &lt;&lt;&lt;-- test is NULL

            test-&gt;ops-&gt;free(test) [event_hist_trigger_free()] {
              [..]
              if (data-&gt;name)
                del_named_trigger(data) {
                  list_del(&amp;amp;data-&gt;named_list);  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-- NEVER gets removed!
                }
              }
           }
         }

         [..]
         kfree(data); &lt;&lt;&lt;-- frees item but it is still on list

The next time a hist with name is registered, it causes an u-a-f bug and
the kernel can crash.

Move the code around such that if event_trigger_register() succeeds, the
next thing called is hist_trigger_enable() which adds it to the list.

A bunch of actions is called if get_named_trigger_data() returns false.
But that doesn't need to be called after event_trigger_register(), so it
can be moved up, allowing event_trigger_register() to be called just
before hist_trigger_enable() keeping them together and allowing the
file-&gt;triggers to be properly populated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21900 | NFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21900</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file

If the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is
possible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again
race with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call
to put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call
which deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.

Instead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()
catches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:39:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21901 | RDMA/bnxt_re: Add sanity checks on rdev validity</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21901</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The MySQL C client library (libmysqlclient) allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to LOAD LOCAL INFILE query, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to untrusted MySQL servers without explicitly disabling the local infile capability. Mydumper has the local infile option enabled by default and does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.18.2-8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:47:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30354 | Bruno ignores Safe-Mode in Asserts expressions</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30354</link><description>Bruno is an open source IDE for exploring and testing APIs. A bug in the assertion runtime caused assert expressions to run in Developer Mode, even if Safe Mode was selected. The bug resulted in the sandbox settings to be ignored for the particular case where a single request is run/sent. This vulnerability's attack surface is limited strictly to scenarios where users import collections from untrusted or malicious sources. The exploit requires deliberate action from the user—specifically, downloading and opening an externally provided malicious Bruno collection. The vulnerability is fixed in 1.39.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:34:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30210 | Bruno XSS On Environment Name</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30210</link><description>Bruno is an open source IDE for exploring and testing APIs. Prior to 1.39.1, the custom tool-tip components which internally use react-tooltip were setting the content (in this case the Environment name) as raw HTML which then gets injected into DOM on hover. This, combined with loose Content Security Policy restrictions, allowed any valid HTML text containing inline script to get executed on hovering over the respective Environment's name. This vulnerability's attack surface is limited strictly to scenarios where users import collections from untrusted or malicious sources. The exploit requires deliberate action from the user—specifically, downloading and opening an externally provided malicious Bruno or Postman collection export and the user hovers on the environment name. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.39.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:34:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28395 | D-LINK DI-8100 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the ipsec_road_asp function via the host_ip parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28395</link><description>D-LINK DI-8100 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the ipsec_road_asp function via the host_ip parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:36:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28398 | D-LINK DI-8100 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the ipsec_net_asp function via the remot_ip parameter.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-28398</link><description>D-LINK DI-8100 16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the ipsec_net_asp function via the remot_ip parameter.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:36:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22231 | VMware Aria Operations updates address a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2025-22231)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22231</link><description>VMware Aria Operations contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges can escalate their privileges to root on the appliance running VMware Aria Operations.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:36:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31408 | WordPress Zoho Flow plugin &amp;lt;= 2.13.3 - Broken Access Control vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31408</link><description>Missing Authorization vulnerability in Zoho Flow allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects Zoho Flow: from n/a through 2.13.3.</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:36:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1658 | DWFX File Parsing Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1658</link><description>A maliciously crafted DWFX file, when parsed through Autodesk Navisworks, can force an Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability.
