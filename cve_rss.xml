Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a `source` parameter that bypasses the `_validate_non_local_source_contains_relative_paths(source)` function's checks, allowing for arbitrary file read access on the server. The issue arises from the handling of unquoted URL characters and the subsequent misuse of the original `source` value for model version creation, leading to the exposure of sensitive files when interacting with the `/model-versions/get-artifact` handler.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1560 | Path Traversal Vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1560</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path validation by exploiting the double decoding process in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts` handler and `local_file_uri_to_path` function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem. This vulnerability is due to an extra unquote operation in the `delete_artifacts` function of `local_artifact_repo.py`, which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version 2.9.2, despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1561 | Arbitrary Local File Read via Component Method Invocation in gradio-app/gradio</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1561</link><description>An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server` endpoint improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1569 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1569</link><description>parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Attackers can exploit the `/open_code_in_vs_code` and similar endpoints without authentication by sending repeated HTTP POST requests, leading to the opening of Visual Studio Code or the default folder opener (e.g., File Explorer, xdg-open) multiple times. This can render the host machine unusable by exhausting system resources. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of the software.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1593 | Path Traversal via Parameter Smuggling in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1593</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository due to improper handling of URL parameters. By smuggling path traversal sequences using the ';' character in URLs, attackers can manipulate the 'params' portion of the URL to gain unauthorized access to files or directories. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary data smuggling into the 'params' part of the URL, enabling attacks similar to those described in previous reports but utilizing the ';' character for parameter smuggling. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or server compromise.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1594 | Local File Read via Path Traversal in mlflow/mlflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1594</link><description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the handling of the `artifact_location` parameter when creating an experiment. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using a fragment component `#` in the artifact location URI to read arbitrary files on the server in the context of the server's process. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-6909 but utilizes a different component of the URI to achieve the same effect.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:05:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1601 | SQL Injection in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1601</link><description>An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `delete_discussion()` function of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, allowing an attacker to delete all discussions and message data. The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/delete_discussion` endpoint, which internally calls the vulnerable `delete_discussion()` function. By sending a specially crafted payload in the 'id' parameter, an attacker can manipulate SQL queries to delete all records from the 'discussion' and 'message' tables. This issue is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1626 | IDOR Vulnerability in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1626</link><description>An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1646 | Authentication Bypass in parisneo/lollms-webui</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1646</link><description>parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to insufficient protection over sensitive endpoints. The application checks if the host parameter is not '0.0.0.0' to restrict access, which is inadequate when the application is bound to a specific interface, allowing unauthorized access to endpoints such as '/restart_program', '/update_software', '/check_update', '/start_recording', and '/stop_recording'. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service, unauthorized disabling or overriding of recordings, and potentially other impacts if certain features are enabled in the configuration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1665 | Unauthorized Evaluation Creation in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1665</link><description>lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0 is vulnerable to unauthorized evaluation creation due to missing server-side checks for user account status during evaluation creation. While the web UI restricts evaluation creation to paid accounts, the server-side API endpoint '/v1/evaluations' does not verify if the user has a paid account, allowing users with free or self-hosted accounts to create unlimited evaluations without upgrading their account. This vulnerability is due to the lack of account status validation in the evaluation creation process.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1666 | Unauthorized Radar Creation in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1666</link><description>In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0, an authorization flaw exists that allows unauthorized radar creation. The vulnerability stems from the lack of server-side checks to verify if a user is on a free account during the radar creation process, which is only enforced in the web UI. As a result, attackers can bypass the intended account upgrade requirement by directly sending crafted requests to the server, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of radars without payment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1738 | Incorrect Authorization in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1738</link><description>An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1739 | Case Insensitive Email Address Validation Vulnerability in lunary-ai/lunary</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1739</link><description>lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to an authentication issue due to improper validation of email addresses during the signup process. Specifically, the server fails to treat email addresses as case insensitive, allowing the creation of multiple accounts with the same email address by varying the case of the email characters. For example, accounts for 'abc@gmail.com' and 'Abc@gmail.com' can both be created, leading to potential impersonation and confusion among users.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:06:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1961 | Path Traversal leading to Arbitrary File Write and RCE in vertaai/modeldb</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1961</link><description>vertaai/modeldb is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to improper sanitization of user-supplied file paths in its file upload functionality.

This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. One scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. Because SSH is sometimes used to authenticate to Git services, it is possible that this vulnerability could be leveraged for supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. It is also conceivable that signed messages from PuTTY or Pageant are readable by adversaries more easily in other scenarios, but none have yet been disclosed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 20:14:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32036 | Use After Free in SixLabors.ImageSharp</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32036</link><description>ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API.

When the A...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28056</link><description>Amazon AWS Amplify CLI before 12.10.1 incorrectly configures the role trust policy of IAM roles associated with Amplify projects. When the Authentication component is removed from an Amplify project, a Condition property is removed but "Effect":"Allow" remains present, and consequently sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity would be available to threat actors with no conditions. Thus, if Amplify CLI had been used to remove the Authentication component from a project built between August 2019 and January 2024, an "assume role" may have occurred, and may have been leveraged to obtain unauthorized access to an organization's AWS resources. NOTE: the problem could only occur if an authorized AWS user removed an Authentication component. (The vulnerability did not give a threat actor the ability to remove an Authentication component.) However, in realistic situations, an authorized AWS user may have removed an Authentication component, e.g., if the objective were to stop using built-in Cognito resources, or move to a completely different identity provider.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 17:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-38511 | iTop Dashboard editor vulnerable dashboard config file parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38511</link><description>iTop is an IT service management platform.

may be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.
Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer
dereferencing later in the code.

To fix this issue, spi_bus-&gt;spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory
allocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly
return -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 14:25:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24863 | NULL pointer deference in __drm_atomic_helper_connector_destroy_state in drm/arm/malidp of Linux kernel</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24863</link><description>In malidp_mw_connector_reset, new memory is allocated with kzalloc, but
