The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 22:27:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0541 | Codezips Gym Management System edit_member.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0541</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Codezips Gym Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.

Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow. However, the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate, upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). Once upgraded, users should make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:38:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-0538 | code-projects Tourism Management System manage-pages.php cross site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0538</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in code-projects Tourism Management System 1.0.

Enabling frame-ancestors: 'self' grants any JupyterHub user the ability to extract formgrader content by sending malicious links to users with access to formgrader, at least when using the default JupyterHub configuration of `enable_subdomains = False`. #1915 disables a protection which would allow user Alice to craft a page embedding formgrader in an IFrame. If Bob visits that page, his credentials will be sent and the formgrader page loaded. Because Alice's page is on the same Origin as the formgrader iframe, Javasript on Alice's page has _full access_ to the contents of the page served by formgrader using Bob's credentials. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `frame-ancestors: self`, or enable per-user and per-service subdomains with `JupyterHub.enable_subdomains = True` (then even if embedding in an IFrame is allowed, the host page does not have access to the contents of the frame).</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:31:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57033 | WeGIA &lt; 3.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the dados_addInfo parameter of documentos_funcionario.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57033</link><description>WeGIA &lt; 3.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via the dados_addInfo parameter of documentos_funcionario.php.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:21:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57035 | WeGIA v3.2.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection viathe nextPage parameter in /controle/control.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57035</link><description>WeGIA v3.2.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection viathe nextPage parameter in /controle/control.php.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:21:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21606 | Local Privilege Escalation via Exposed XPC Method Due to Client Verification Failure in stats</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21606</link><description>stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the user’s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:21:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23039 | Cross Site Scripting on URL decode Tooltip in Caido</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23039</link><description>Caido is a web security auditing toolkit.

Attackers can inject malicious parameters into the JDBC URL, triggering JNDI injection during the process when the JDBC Driver uses this URL to connect to the database. This could lead to remote code execution. JNDI injection is possible via the JDBC connection property krbJAASFile for the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS). Using untrusted parameters in the krbJAASFile and/or remote host can trigger JNDI injection in the JDBC URL through the krbJAASFile.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 22:18:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-55511 | A null pointer dereference vulnerability in Macrium Reflect prior to 8.1.8017 allows an attacker to elevate their privileges via executing a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55511</link><description>A null pointer dereference vulnerability in Macrium Reflect prior to 8.1.8017 allows an attacker to elevate their privileges via executing a specially crafted executable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 22:18:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57575 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the ssid parameter in the form_fast_setting_wifi_set function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57575</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the ssid parameter in the form_fast_setting_wifi_set function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57577 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the speed_dir parameter in the formSetSpeedWan function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57577</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the speed_dir parameter in the formSetSpeedWan function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57578 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the funcpara1 parameter in the formSetCfm function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57578</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the funcpara1 parameter in the formSetCfm function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57579 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the limitSpeedUp parameter in the formSetClientState function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57579</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the limitSpeedUp parameter in the formSetClientState function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57580 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the devName parameter in the formSetDeviceName function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57580</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the devName parameter in the formSetDeviceName function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57581 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the firewallEn parameter in the formSetFirewallCfg function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57581</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the firewallEn parameter in the formSetFirewallCfg function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57582 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the startIP parameter in the formSetPPTPServer function.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57582</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the startIP parameter in the formSetPPTPServer function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-57583 | Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the usbName parameter in the formSetSambaConf functi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57583</link><description>Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.19 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the usbName parameter in the formSetSambaConf function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:28:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23760 | WordPress Chatter plugin &amp;lt;= 1.0.1 - CSRF to Stored XSS vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23760</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Alex Volkov Chatter allows Stored XSS.

A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an "Admin" role user to remove a "Root" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an "Admin" user from removing a "Root" user. As a result, an attacker with an "Admin" role can remove critical "Root" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:37:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56136 | /api/v1/jwt/fetch_api_key endpoint can leak if an email address has an account in Zulip server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56136</link><description>Zulip server provides an open-source team chat that helps teams stay productive and focused.

MMR before version 1.3.5 allows, by design, unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release, closing the attack vector. Though extremely limited, server operators can use more strict rate limits based on IP address as a partial workaround.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:29:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36403 | Denial of service/high operating costs through unauthenticated downloads in Matrix Media Repo</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36403</link><description>Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 is vulnerable to unbounded disk consumption, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce it to download and cache large amounts of remote media files. MMR's typical operating environment uses S3-like storage as a backend, with file-backed store as an alternative option. Instances using a file-backed store or those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack. Once the disk is full, authenticated users will be unable to upload new media, resulting in denial of service. For instances configured to use a cloud-based S3 storage option, this could result in high service fees instead of a denial of service. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a new default-on "leaky bucket" rate limit to reduce the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data. Operators should note that the leaky bucket implementation introduced in MMR 1.3.5 requires the IP address associated with the request to be forwarded, to avoid mistakenly applying the rate limit to the reverse proxy instead. To avoid this issue, the reverse proxy should populate the X-Forwarded-For header when sending the request to MMR. Operators who cannot update may wish to lower the maximum file size they allow and implement harsh rate limits, though this can still lead to a large amount of data to be downloaded.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:22:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52602 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) on redirects and federation in Matrix Media Repo</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52602</link><description>Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix.

If SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are enabled (they are disabled by default), a user may upload a file which claims to be either of these types and request a thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file. If MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead. MMR uses a number of other decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit. This is fixed in MMR v1.3.8. MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the SVG, JPEGXL, and MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config which prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. Containers and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. Some installations of ImageMagick may disable "unsafe" file types, like PDFs, already. This option can be replicated to other environments as needed. ffmpeg may be compiled with limited decoders/codecs. The Docker image for MMR disables PDFs and similar formats by default.</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:22:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-52594 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) on redirects and federation in gomatrixserverlib</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52594</link><description>Gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix federation.
