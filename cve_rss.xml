This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.

When using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),  A crafted ZIP file can be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently, sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation, code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.

It's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives, and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.</description><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 22:29:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3539 | H3C Magic BE18000 HTTP POST Request getBasicInfo FCGI_CheckStringIfContainsSemicolon command injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3539</link><description>A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in H3C Magic NX15, Magic NX30 Pro, Magic NX400, Magic R3010 and Magic BE18000 up to V100R014.
