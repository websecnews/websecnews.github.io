Rothel from QED Secure Solutions has found that the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi
did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a possible remote code
execution. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an
operator- or administrator-privileged service account. The impact of exploiting
this vulnerability is lower with operator-privileges compared to
administrator-privileges service accounts. Axis has released patched AXIS OS
versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory
for more information and solution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 05:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-5800 | Insufficient input validation in VAPIX API create_overlay.cgi</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5800</link><description>Vintage,
