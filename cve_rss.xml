This results in subsequent chunk_length calculations producing negative values (e.g., chunk_length = 65536 - buffer_length), which are passed as signed integers to the read() method, potentially triggering unlimited read operations and resource exhaustion. (2) Memory Leak via Missing Reference Count Release (CWE-401): The main processing loop fails to release Python object references (Py_DECREF) for chunk objects allocated in each iteration. For CBOR strings longer than 65536 bytes, this causes cumulative memory leaks proportional to the payload size, enabling memory exhaustion attacks through repeated processing of large CBOR payloads. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without authentication by sending specially-crafted CBOR data containing definite-length text strings with multi-byte UTF-8 characters positioned at 65536-byte chunk boundaries. Successful exploitation results in denial of service through process crashes (CBORDecodeEOF exceptions) or memory exhaustion. The vulnerabilities affect all applications using cbor2's C extension to process untrusted CBOR data, including web APIs, IoT data collectors, and message queue processors. Fixed in commit 851473490281f82d82560b2368284ef33cf6e8f9 pushed with released version 5.7.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:23:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-56643 | Requarks Wiki.js 2.5.307 does not properly revoke or invalidate active JWT tokens when a user logs out.

The manifest contains package URLs and SHA-256 hashes but is not digitally signed, so its authenticity relies solely on the underlying TLS channel. In affected versions, TLS certificate validation can be disabled when a proxy is configured, allowing an attacker who can intercept network traffic to supply a malicious update manifest and corresponding package with a matching hash. This can cause the client to download and install a tampered update, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the GoSign Desktop user on Windows and macOS, or with elevated privileges on some Linux deployments. A local attacker who can modify proxy settings may also abuse this behavior to escalate privileges by forcing installation of a crafted update.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:52:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-55796 | The openml/openml.org web application version v2.0.20241110 uses predictable MD5-based tokens for critical user workflows such as signup con...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55796</link><description>The openml/openml.org web application version v2.0.20241110 uses predictable MD5-based tokens for critical user workflows such as signup confirmation, password resets, email confirmation resends, and email change confirmation. These tokens are generated by hashing the current timestamp formatted as "%d %H:%M:%S" without incorporating any user-specific data or cryptographic randomness.

When __builtins__ is not explicitly defined, Python automatically provides access to all built-in functions including __import__, exec, eval, and open. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with full system privileges, leading to complete system compromise.

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of dangerous Python built-in functions (__import__, getattr, hasattr) in the execution namespace and the direct use of exec() to execute user-supplied code. An attacker can craft malicious queries to execute arbitrary Python code, leading to AWS credential theft (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), file system access, environment variable disclosure, and potential system compromise. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass intended security controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources and credentials stored in the server's environment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9977 | Improper neutralization of input in Times Software E-PAYROLL</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9977</link><description>Value provided in one of POST parameters sent during the process of logging in to Times Software E-Payroll is not sanitized properly, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform DoS attacks.

Due to improper validation of client certificate–based authentication in certain default configurations, the affected components may permit unauthenticated requests even when mTLS is enabled. This condition occurs when relying on the default mTLS settings for System REST APIs or when the mTLS authenticator is enabled for SOAP services, causing these interfaces to accept requests without enforcing additional authentication.

Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor with network access to the affected endpoints to gain administrative privileges and perform unauthorized operations. The vulnerability is exploitable only when the impacted mTLS flows are enabled and accessible in a given deployment. Other certificate-based authentication mechanisms—such as Mutual TLS OAuth client authentication and X.509 login flows—are not affected, and APIs served through the API Gateway of WSO2 API Manager remain unaffected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:22:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13344 | SourceCodester Train Station Ticketing System ajax.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13344</link><description>A weakness has been identified in SourceCodester Train Station Ticketing System 1.0.

A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted link, leading the browser to issue unintended state-changing requests. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operations such as data modification, account changes, or other administrative actions.

In versions from 22.11 to before 25.05 and versions before Unstable 25.11, a hard-coded secret was used in the NixOS module for the OnlyOffice document server to protect its file cache. An attacker with knowledge of an existing revision ID could use this secret to obtain a document. In practice, an arbitrary revision ID should be hard to obtain. The primary impact is likely the access to known documents from users with expired access. This issue was resolved in NixOS unstable version 25.11 and version 25.05.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:44:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13301 | itsourcecode Web-Based Internet Laboratory Management System controller.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13301</link><description>A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Web-Based Internet Laboratory Management System 1.0.

This can be problematic if the GoSign Desktop user selects an arbitrary proxy server without consideration of whether outbound HTTPS connections from the proxy server to Internet servers succeed even for untrusted or invalid server certificates. In this scenario (which is outside of the product's design objectives), integrity protection could be bypassed. In typical cases of a proxy server for outbound HTTPS traffic from an enterprise, those connections would not succeed. (Admittedly, the usual expectation is that a client application is configured to trust an enterprise CA and does not set SSL_VERIFY_NONE.) Also, it is of course unsafe to place ~/.gosign in the home directory of an untrusted user and then have other users execute downloaded files.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:59:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13288 | Tenda CH22 PPTPUserSetting fromPptpUserSetting buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13288</link><description>A security vulnerability has been detected in Tenda CH22 1.0.0.1.
