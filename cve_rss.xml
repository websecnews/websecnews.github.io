ipc/mqueue, msg, sem: avoid relying on a stack reference past its expiry

do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with a stack local address.  The
sender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.

This leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive
call might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid
address, causing the following crash:

  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60
  Call Trace:
   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490
   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343

The race occurs as:

1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct
   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it
   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not
   been overwritten.

2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info-&gt;e_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and
   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call
   __pipelined_op.

3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&amp;this-&gt;state,
   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is
   `ewq_addr`.)

4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it
   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.

5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed
   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's
   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another
   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an
   indefinite time.)

6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a
   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to
   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has
   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr-&gt;task` is the right task_struct.
   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a
   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.

do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after
setting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.
Change __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's
task_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`
which sits on the receiver's stack.

As Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in
ipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.  Fix
those in the same way.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 21:21:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47070 | uio_hv_generic: Fix another memory leak in error handling paths</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47070</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

In such a case, we need to free the buffer explicitly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 21:21:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47072 | btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is synced</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47072</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is synced

When we move one inode from one directory to another and both the inode
and its previous parent directory were logged before, we are not supposed
to have the dentry for the old parent if we have a power failure after the
log is synced. Only the new dentry is supposed to exist.

Generally this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is
not currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that
was moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index and
dir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained with the
following example and reproducer:

  # The test requires a very specific layout of keys and items in the
  # fs/subvolume btree to trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that
  # on whatever platform we are, we have the same leaf/node size.
  #
  # Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page
  # size (but it can be greater than the page size). So use the largest
  # supported node/leaf size (64K).

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt

  # "testdir" is inode 257.
  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir
  $ chmod 755 /mnt/testdir

  # Create several empty files to have the directory "testdir" with its
  # items spread over several leaves (7 in this case).
  $ for ((i = 1; i &lt;= 1200; i++)); do
       echo -n &gt; /mnt/testdir/file$i
    done

  # Create our test directory "dira", inode number 1458, which gets all
  # its items in leaf 7.
  #
  # The BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY item for inode 257 ("testdir") that points to
  # the entry named "dira" is in leaf 2, while the BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY
  # item that points to that entry is in leaf 3.
  #
  # For this particular filesystem node size (64K), file count and file
  # names, we endup with the directory entry items from inode 257 in
  # leaves 2 and 3, as previously mentioned - what matters for triggering
  # the bug exercised by this test case is that those items are not placed
  # in leaf 1, they must be placed in a leaf different from the one
  # containing the inode item for inode 257.
  #
  # The corresponding BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items for
  # the parent inode (257) are the following:
  #
  #    item 460 key (257 DIR_ITEM 3724298081) itemoff 48344 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira
  #
  # and:
  #
  #    item 771 key (257 DIR_INDEX 1202) itemoff 36673 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira

  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir/dira

  # Make sure everything done so far is durably persisted.
  $ sync

  # Now do a change to inode 257 ("testdir") that does not result in
  # COWing leaves 2 and 3 - the leaves that contain the directory items
  # pointing to inode 1458 (directory "dira").
  #
  # Changing permissions, the owner/group, updating or adding a xattr,
  # etc, will not change (COW) leaves 2 and 3. So for the sake of
  # simplicity change the permissions of inode 257, which results in
  # updating its inode item and therefore change (COW) only leaf 1.

  $ chmod 700 /mnt/testdir

  # Now fsync directory inode 257.
  #
  # Since only the first leaf was changed/COWed, we log the inode item of
  # inode 257 and only the dentries found in the first leaf, all have a
  # key type of BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY, and no keys of type
  # BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY, because they sort after the former type and none
  # exist in the first leaf.
  #
  # We also log 3 items that represent ranges for dir items and dir
  # indexes for which the log is authoritative:
  #
  # 1) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY, which indicates the log is
  #    authoritative for all BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY keys that have an offset
  #    in the range [0, 2285968570] (the offset here is th

API qedf_link_update() is getting called from QED but by that time
shost_data is not initialised. This results in a NULL pointer dereference
when we try to dereference shost_data while updating supported_speeds.

Add a NULL pointer check before dereferencing shost_data.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 21:22:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47078 | RDMA/rxe: Clear all QP fields if creation failed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47078</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory

Our code analyzer reported a uaf.

In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()
with 2 refcount.
If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb
branch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freed
if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb-&gt;id later,
which is a potential uaf.

My patch add a variable 'id' to accept the value of cb-&gt;id before the
hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 21:22:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27101 | Integer overflow in chunking helper causes dispatching to miss elements or panic</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27101</link><description>SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired database for creating and managing security-critical application permissions.

ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING is (only) used and checked by adf_vf2pf_shutdown()
before calling adf_iov_putmsg()-&gt;mutex_lock(vf2pf_lock), however the
vf2pf_lock is initialized in adf_dev_init(), which can fail and when it
fail, the vf2pf_lock is either not initialized or destroyed, a subsequent
use of vf2pf_lock will cause issue.
To fix this issue, only set this flag if adf_dev_init() returns 0.

KVM: Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed

Abort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev()
fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus.  If it can't
instantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ the
target device.   But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated the
bus and invoked the destructor for all devices that were on the bus.  In
the coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted list entry
dereference due to attempting to continue iterating on coalesced_zones
after future entries (in the walk) have been deleted.

Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop, which encompasses
many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a single
if statement.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 22:47:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47061 | KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync&amp;#x27;ing SRCU</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47061</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Use the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting
VMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead of
created_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as
created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at
the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the
bulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly
restricting the max number of max vCPUs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 22:47:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47063 | drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47063</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The statement where an array is being overrun is shown in the following snippet:

	if (rate &lt;= DESC_RATE11M)
		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g-&gt;cck_base[group];
	else
====&gt;		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g-&gt;bw40_base[group];

The associated arrays are defined in main.h as follows:

struct rtw_2g_txpwr_idx {
	u8 cck_base[6];
	u8 bw40_base[5];
	struct rtw_2g_1s_pwr_idx_diff ht_1s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_2s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_3s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff;
};

The problem arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match the layout of
efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to rtw_get_channel_group() and set
the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate &lt;= DESC_RATE11M.

async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page

Now we support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To
support this, it needs to support calculating xor value with different
offsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets.

In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It sets
ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.
So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it only
needs src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It can
cause data corruption problem.

I can reproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are:

  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G
  mkfs.xfs /dev/md0

net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect

Commits 8a4cd82d ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()")
and c33b1cc62 ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()")
fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.

This can be triggered by the following simple program:
    int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    memset( &amp;addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
    addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
    bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
    bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
    close(sock1);
    close(sock2);

Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock-&gt;local after calling
nfc_llcp_local_put.

drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling

If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl()
we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top.
But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL, and so if we then
get another error during the retry, before the fb lookup, we proceed
the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference.
The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed
while it's still in use.

Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again
until we've done another fb lookup.

This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async
flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I
saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking
the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops
instead, and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52487 | net/mlx5e: Fix peer flow lists handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52487</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix peer flow lists handling

The cited change refactored mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() to only clear DUP
flag when list of peer flows has become empty. However, if any concurrent
user holds a reference to a peer flow (for example, the neighbor update
workqueue task is updating peer flow's parent encap entry concurrently),
then the flow will not be removed from the peer list and, consecutively,
DUP flag will remain set. Since mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peers_flow() calls
mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() for every possible peer index the algorithm
will try to remove the flow from eswitch instances that it has never peered
with causing either NULL pointer dereference when trying to remove the flow
peer list head of peer_index that was never initialized or a warning if the
list debug config is enabled[0].

Fix the issue by always removing the peer flow from the list even when not
releasing the last reference to it.

serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the
initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data
without having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the
IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.

The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write
from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on
the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled
manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these
functions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the
cache accordingly.

Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to
remove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the
_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so
cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52489 | mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section-&amp;gt;usage</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52489</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section-&gt;usage

The below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory
region with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that
[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end
pfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered
will try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because
pfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When
from other core, the section mappings are being removed for the
ZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which
compaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash
with CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].

NOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between
the pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with
SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

The commit b943f045a9af("mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with
pfn_section_valid check") tried to address the same problem by clearing
the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns
false thus ms-&gt;usage is not accessed.

Fix this issue by the below steps:

a) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the -&gt;usage.

b) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL
   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access -&gt;usage.

c) Free the -&gt;usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms-&gt;usage = NULL.  No
   attempt will be made to access -&gt;usage after this as the
   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.

Thanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.

On Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as

For this particular issue below is the log.  Though the below log is
not directly pointing to the pfn_section_valid(){ ms-&gt;usage;}, when we
loaded this dump on T32 lauterbach tool, it is pointing.

When running stress-ng testing, we found below kernel crash after a few hours:

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's -&gt;mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page-&gt;mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's -&gt;mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page-&gt;private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page-&gt;mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52491 | media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52491</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run

In mtk_jpeg_probe, &amp;jpeg-&gt;job_timeout_work is bound with
mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.

In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in
mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while
mark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.

There are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the
module, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.
The possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a
use-after-free bug.

CPU0                  CPU1
mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |
  start worker	    |
                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work
mtk_jpeg_remove     |
  v4l2_m2m_release  |
    kfree(m2m_dev); |
                    |
                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv
                    |   m2m_dev-&gt;curr_ctx //use

If we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,
it will have a similar sequence.

Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker
successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in
either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52492 | dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52492</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function

__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,
chan-&gt;local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan-&gt;local is nullified.
When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API or
intentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionally
unregistered, leading to this NULL pointer:
[    1.318693] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0

Look at dma_async_device_register() function error path, channel device
unregistration is done only if chan-&gt;local is not NULL.

Then add the same condition at the beginning of
__dma_async_device_channel_unregister() function, to avoid NULL pointer
issue whatever the API used to reach this function.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52493 | bus: mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52493</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Ensure read and write locks for the channel are not taken in succession by
dropping the read lock from parse_xfer_event() such that a callback given
to client can potentially queue buffers and acquire the write lock in that
process. Any queueing of buffers should be done without channel read lock
acquired as it can result in multiple locks and a soft lockup.

Though we do check the event ring read pointer by "is_valid_ring_ptr"

pointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements
are 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer
could lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.

So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52495 | soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix port sanity check</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52495</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression

Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace
decompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages of
compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.

However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compressed
data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it
explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:
  __________________________________________________________
 |_ direction of decompression --&gt; ____ |_ compressed data _|

Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps two
individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.
Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for
short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to
completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported
that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.
After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the new
FSRM feature expose this issue with "rep movsb".

Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace
decompression for now.  Later, as an useful improvement, we could try
to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52498 | PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52498</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code

It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core
code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument
function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in
that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already
held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within
dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may
cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a
requisite supplier device's one, for example).

Address this by changing the code in question to use
async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous
execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly
run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26608 | ksmbd: fix global oob in ksmbd_nl_policy</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26608</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

core.c:nf_hook_slow assumes that the upper 16 bits of NF_DROP

Due to the reverted commit, its possible to provide a positive

Its not clear to me why this commit was made.

NF_QUEUE is not used by nftables; "queue" rules in nftables

If we later need to allow specifiying errno values from userspace

if we copy to iwl_fw_ini_trigger_tlv::data + offset while offset is in
bytes, we'll write past the buffer.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26611 | xsk: fix usage of multi-buffer BPF helpers for ZC XDP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26611</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This comes from __xdp_return() call with xdp_buff argument passed as
NULL which is supposed to be consumed by xsk_buff_free() call.

To address this properly, in ZC case, a node that represents the frag
being removed has to be pulled out of xskb_list. Introduce
appropriate xsk helpers to do such node operation and use them
accordingly within bpf_xdp_adjust_tail().</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26612 | netfs, fscache: Prevent Oops in fscache_put_cache()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26612</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv

Syzcaller UBSAN crash occurs in rds_cmsg_recv(),
which reads inc-&gt;i_rx_lat_trace[j + 1] with index 4 (3 + 1),
but with array size of 4 (RDS_RX_MAX_TRACES).
Here 'j' is assigned from rs-&gt;rs_rx_trace[i] and in-turn from
trace.rx_trace_pos[i] in rds_recv_track_latency(),
with both arrays sized 3 (RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX). So fix the
off-by-one bounds check in rds_recv_track_latency() to prevent
a potential crash in rds_cmsg_recv().

It is possible that the connection is in process of being established
when we dump it. Assumed that the connection has been registered in a
link group by smc_conn_create() but the rmb_desc has not yet been
initialized by smc_buf_create(), thus causing the illegal access to
conn-&gt;rmb_desc. So fix it by checking before dump.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26616 | btrfs: scrub: avoid use-after-free when chunk length is not 64K aligned</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26616</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[BUG]
There is a bug report that, on a ext4-converted btrfs, scrub leads to
various problems, including:

- "unable to find chunk map" errors
  BTRFS info (device vdb): scrub: started on devid 1
  BTRFS critical (device vdb): unable to find chunk map for logical 2214744064 length 4096
  BTRFS critical (device vdb): unable to find chunk map for logical 2214744064 length 45056

  This would lead to unrepariable errors.

- Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free

[CAUSE]
The converted fs has the following data chunk layout:

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single

For above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end
(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).

This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio
function for both of the two halves.

However scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function
to be called once, not any more.
This means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,
leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to
use-after-free.

[FIX]
- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range
  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not
  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.

- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range
  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to
  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.

Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:

- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()
  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,
  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read
  beyond the chunk.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26617 | fs/proc/task_mmu: move mmu notification mechanism inside mm lock</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26617</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix

The vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter or
domain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to update
the guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and
domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only
the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new
domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to
the vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's
matrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.

Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will
result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the
vfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:

guest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):
14.0004
14.0005
14.0006
16.0004
16.0005
16.0006

unassign domain 4
unbind queue 16.0005
assign domain 4

When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the
APQNs that will be examined will be:
14.0004
16.0004

Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the
vfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix
when updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005
will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This
violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be
given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their
pass-through.

To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will
be inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:57:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24818 | EspoCRM weakness in &amp;quot;Forgot password&amp;quot;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24818</link><description>EspoCRM is an Open Source Customer Relationship Management software.

drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before sending a command

[Why]
We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
powered on.

[How]
For functions that execute within a DC context or DC lock we can
wrap the direct calls to dm_execute_dmub_cmd/list with code that
exits idle power optimizations and reallows once we're done with
the command submission on success.

For DM direct submissions the DM will need to manage the enter/exit
sequencing manually.

We cannot invoke a DMCUB command directly within the DM execution
helper or we can deadlock.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:10:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2001 | Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Cockpit CMS</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2001</link><description>A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Cockpit CMS affecting version 2.7.0.

The issue here is as follows:

- tidss probes, but is deferred as sii902x is still missing.
- sii902x starts probing and enters sii902x_init().
- sii902x calls drm_bridge_add(). Now the sii902x bridge is ready from
  DRM's perspective.
- sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() and
  platform_device_register_data()
- The registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the
  deferred devices.
- tidss probes, which eventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be
  called.
- sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid.
  However, the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading
  to the crash.

Fix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the
sii902x_init(), which is also at the very end of sii902x_probe().</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:54:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27906 | Apache Airflow: Dag Code and Import Error Permissions Ignored</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27906</link><description>Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.2, has a vulnerability that allows authenticated users to view DAG code and import errors of DAGs they do not have permission to view through the API and the UI.

syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This
happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from
the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message
completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not
exist anymore and hence the bug.

perf/x86/lbr: Filter vsyscall addresses

We found that a panic can occur when a vsyscall is made while LBR sampling
is active. If the vsyscall is interrupted (NMI) for perf sampling, this
call sequence can occur (most recent at top):

    __insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_prefixes()
    insn_get_opcode()
    decode_branch_type()
    get_branch_type()
    intel_pmu_lbr_filter()
    intel_pmu_handle_irq()
    perf_event_nmi_handler()

Within __insn_get_emulate_prefix() at frame 0, a macro is called:

    peek_nbyte_next(insn_byte_t, insn, i)

Within this macro, this dereference occurs:

    (insn)-&gt;next_byte

Inspecting registers at this point, the value of the next_byte field is the
address of the vsyscall made, for example the location of the vsyscall
version of gettimeofday() at 0xffffffffff600000. The access to an address
in the vsyscall region will trigger an oops due to an unhandled page fault.

To fix the bug, filtering for vsyscalls can be done when
determining the branch type. This patch will return
a "none" branch if a kernel address if found to lie in the
vsyscall region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:54:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52477 | usb: hub: Guard against accesses to uninitialized BOS descriptors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52477</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect

hidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)
races when it races with itself.

hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs
on probe() and if a "device-connected" packet is received by the hw
when the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on
the hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be
started from the workqueue.

This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):

1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):

	if (!hidpp-&gt;protocol_major) {
		hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()
		hidpp-&gt;protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];
	}

We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output
attached to rhbz#2227968:

[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.

Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads
take turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong
through all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:

2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):

	if (hidpp-&gt;name == hdev-&gt;name) {
		...
		hidpp-&gt;name = new_name;
	}

3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):

hidpp_initialize_battery()
{
        if (hidpp-&gt;battery.ps)
                return 0;

	probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */

	hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp-&gt;battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,
					   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);
}

4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):

	if (hidpp-&gt;delayed_input)
		return;

	hidpp-&gt;delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);

The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following
sequence:

	hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp-&gt;battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,
					   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);

	...

	hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp-&gt;battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,
					   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);

So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,
which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even
the really big problem.

Notice how:

1. This is all devm-maganaged
2. The hidpp-&gt;battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies
3. hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second
   devm_kmemdup()

This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:
1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered
2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,
   hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory
3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,
   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes
   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data
4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties which
   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:

arm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround

Implement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an
affected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load
might leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The
issue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the same
translation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects
the return to EL0.

The workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all
loads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is
sufficient.

The workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is
enabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should
normally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature
and the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is enabled).</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:54:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52482 | x86/srso: Add SRSO mitigation for Hygon processors</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52482</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock

Our current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null)
traverse the net's route list without the RCU read lock held. This means
the route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential
grace period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the
route pointer.

Add the proper read-side critical section locks around the route
lookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.

The remaining net-&gt;mctp.routes accesses are already under a
rcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates.

Based on an analysis from Sili Luo &lt;rootlab@huawei.com&gt;, where
introducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on
simultaneous sendmsg() and route deletion.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:54:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52484 | iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Fix soft lockup triggered by arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52484</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Note that since 6.6-rc1 the arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range above is renamed
to "arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs", yet the problem remains.

The commit 06ff87bae8d3 ("arm64: mm: remove unused functions and variable
protoypes") fixed a similar lockup on the CPU MMU side. Yet, it can occur
to SMMU too, since arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is called
typically next to MMU tlb flush function, e.g.
	tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly {
		tlb_flush {
			__flush_tlb_range {
				// check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
		mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
			arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
				// does not check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
	}

Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in tlbflush.h, since in an
SVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it makes sense to align with the
tlbflush code. Then, replace per-page TLBI commands with a single per-asid
TLBI command, if the request size hits this threshold.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:54:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25093 | WordPress GD Rating System Plugin &amp;lt;= 3.5 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25093</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Milan Petrovic GD Rating System allows Stored XSS.This issue affects GD Rating System: from n/a through 3.5.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:54:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23501 | WordPress Ebook Store Plugin &amp;lt;= 5.788 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23501</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Shopfiles Ltd Ebook Store allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Ebook Store: from n/a through 5.788.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:47:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50905 | WordPress WP Activity Log Plugin &amp;lt;= 4.6.1 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50905</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Melapress WP Activity Log allows Stored XSS.This issue affects WP Activity Log: from n/a through 4.6.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:40:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1976 | The Marketing Optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 20200925.
