While the get_login_url method allows for state generation, it does not persist the state or bind it to the user's session. Consequently, the verify_and_process method accepts the state received in the query parameters without verifying it against a trusted local value. This allows a remote attacker to trick a victim into visiting a malicious callback URL, which can result in the attacker's account being linked to the victim's internal account.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:12:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14939 | code-projects Online Appointment Booking System deletemanager.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14939</link><description>A vulnerability was found in code-projects Online Appointment Booking System 1.0.

This issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept or redirect log traffic under the following conditions:

  *  The attacker is able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the log receiver.
  *  The attacker can present a server certificate issued by a certification authority trusted by the Socket Appender’s configured trust store (or by the default Java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).


Users are advised to upgrade to Apache Log4j Core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.

As an alternative mitigation, the Socket Appender may be configured to use a private or restricted trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:53:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46268 | Advantech WebAccess/SCADA SQL Injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46268</link><description>Advantech WebAccess/SCADA

scripting is utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises 
from the absence of proper security controls that restrict which Python 
libraries can be imported and executed within the scripting environment.
 The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having system 
permissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an 
authenticated administrator uploads a malicious project file containing 
Python scripts with bind shell capabilities, the application executes 
these scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition Gateway process, 
which typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. 
Alternative code execution patterns could lead to similar results.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:27:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59529 | simple protocol server ignores accepts unlimited connections and logs failures without limit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59529</link><description>Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:27:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63947 | A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in phpMsAdmin version 2.2 in the database_mode.php file.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request with a very large SEID (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that causes an integer conversion/underflow in LocalNode.DeleteSess() / LocalNode.Sess() when a uint64 SEID is converted to int and used in index arithmetic. This leads to a negative index into n.sess and a Go runtime panic, resulting in a denial of service (UPF crash). The issue has been reproduced on free5GC v4.1.0 with crashes observed in the session lookup/deletion path in internal/pfcp/node.go; other versions may also be affected.

usb: typec: ucsi: fix use-after-free caused by uec-&gt;work

The delayed work uec-&gt;work is scheduled in gaokun_ucsi_probe()
but never properly canceled in gaokun_ucsi_remove(). This creates
use-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure
are freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the
gaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing
or still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi
or ucsi structure may then be accessed.

Furthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently
long to make this bug easily reproducible. The following is the

scsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work

The delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and
scheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the
IMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),
the imm_struct device instance is deallocated.

However, the delayed work might still be pending or executing
when imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs
when the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already
freed imm_struct memory.

The race condition can occur as follows:

CPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1
                       | imm_queuecommand()
                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()
imm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()
  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()
                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE
                           dev-&gt; //USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper
cancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68325 | net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68325</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63757 | Integer overflow vulnerability in the yuv2ya16_X_c_template function in libswscale/output.c in FFmpeg 8.0.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-63757</link><description>Integer overflow vulnerability in the yuv2ya16_X_c_template function in libswscale/output.c in FFmpeg 8.0.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:02:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64468 | Use-after-Free in sentry!sentry_span_set_data() in NI LabVIEW</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-64468</link><description>There is a use-after-free vulnerability in sentry!sentry_span_set_data() when parsing a corrupted VI file.

The server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers: "device", "sku", "type", and a client‑computed "value", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret originating from the device itself.

The vulnerability has been verified for the Govee H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected devices. The vendor is not able to provide a list of affected products, but rolls out a firmware and server-side fixes. Devices that reached end‑of‑life for security support need replacement with newer models supporting updates.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:33:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-40602 | A local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient authorization in the SonicWall SMA1000 appliance management console (AMC).</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-40602</link><description>A local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient authorization in the SonicWall SMA1000 appliance management console (AMC).</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:16:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13641 | Photo Gallery, Sliders, Proofing and Themes – NextGEN Gallery &amp;lt;= 3.59.12 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Local File Inclusion via &amp;#x27;template&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13641</link><description>The Photo Gallery, Sliders, Proofing and Themes – NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.59.12 via the 'template' shortcode parameter.

In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:51:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14833 | code-projects Online Appointment Booking System deletemanagerclinic.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14833</link><description>A security flaw has been discovered in code-projects Online Appointment Booking System 1.0.

A vulnerability present starting in versions 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, and 10.1.10 relates to Storybook’s handling of environment variables defined in a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command. When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable, thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. For a project to potentially be vulnerable to this issue, it must build the Storybook (i.e. run `storybook build` directly or indirectly) in a directory that contains a `.env` file (including variants like `.env.local`) and publish the built Storybook to the web. Storybooks built without a `.env` file at build time are not affected, including common CI-based builds where secrets are provided via platform environment variables rather than `.env` files. Storybook runtime environments (i.e. `storybook dev`) are not affected. Deployed applications that share a repo with your Storybook are not affected. Users should upgrade their Storybook—on both their local machines and CI environment—to version .6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, or 10.1.10 as soon as possible. Maintainers additionally recommend that users audit for any sensitive secrets provided via `.env` files and rotate those keys. Some projects may have been relying on the undocumented behavior at the heart of this issue and will need to change how they reference environment variables after this update. If a project can no longer read necessary environmental variable values, either prefix the variables with `STORYBOOK_` or use the `env` property in Storybook’s configuration to manually specify values. In either case, do not include sensitive secrets as they will be included in the built bundle.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68434 | opensourcepos has Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability that leads to Unauthorized Administrator Creation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68434</link><description>Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68143 | mcp-server-git&amp;#x27;s unrestricted git_init tool allows repository creation at arbitrary filesystem locations</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68143</link><description>Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the model context protocol (MCP). In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2025.9.25, the git_init tool accepted arbitrary filesystem paths and created Git repositories without validating the target location. Unlike other tools which required an existing repository, git_init could operate on any directory accessible to the server process, making those directories eligible for subsequent git operations. The tool was removed entirely, as the server is intended to operate on existing repositories only.

This could allow tool calls to operate on other repositories accessible to the server process. The fix adds path validation that resolves both the configured repository and the requested path (following symlinks) and verifies the requested path is within the allowed repository before executing any git operations.

Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the "Return Policy" configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the "Store Configuration" (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the "Return Policy" field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:39:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14832 | itsourcecode Online Cake Ordering System updateproduct.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14832</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in itsourcecode Online Cake Ordering System 1.0.

Prior to version 3.20.0, a vulnerability exists in FreeRDP’s certificate handling code on Windows platforms. The function `freerdp_certificate_data_hash_ uses` the Microsoft-specific `_snprintf` function to format certificate cache filenames without guaranteeing NUL termination when truncation occurs. According to Microsoft documentation, `_snprintf` does not append a terminating NUL byte if the formatted output exceeds the destination buffer size. If an attacker controls the hostname value (for example via server redirection or a crafted .rdp file), the resulting filename buffer may not be NUL-terminated. Subsequent string operations performed on this buffer may read beyond the allocated memory region, resulting in a heap-based out-of-bounds read. In default configurations, the connection is typically terminated before sensitive data can be meaningfully exposed, but unintended memory read or a client crash may still occur under certain conditions. Version 3.20.0 has a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:15:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68129 | Auth0-PHP SDK has Improper Audience Validation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-68129</link><description>Auth0-PHP is a PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs.

A vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 fragmentation reassembly implementation of RIOT OS v2025.07. When copying the contents of the first fragment (offset=0) into the reassembly buffer, no size check is performed. It is possible to force the creation of a small reassembly buffer by first sending a shorter fragment (also with offset=0). Overflowing the reassembly buffer corrupts the state of other packet buffers which an attacker might be able to used to achieve further memory corruption (potentially resulting in remote code execution). To trigger the vulnerability, the `gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag` module must be included and the attacker must be able to send arbitrary IPv6 packets to the victim. Version 2025.10 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 20:42:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14759 | The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for .NET is an open-source client-side encryption library used to facilitate writing and reading encrypted r...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14759</link><description>The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for .NET is an open-source client-side encryption library used to facilitate writing and reading encrypted records to S3.

A vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 fragmentation reassembly implementation of RIOT OS v2025.07. When receiving an fragmented IPv6 packet with fragment offset 0 and an empty payload, the payload pointer is set to NULL. However, the implementation still tries to copy the payload into the reassembly buffer, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference which crashes the OS (DoS). To trigger the vulnerability, the `gnrc_ipv6_ext_frag` module must be enabled and the attacker must be able to send arbitrary IPv6 packets to the victim. RIOT OS v2025.10 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:37:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67074 | A Buffer overflow vulnerability in function fromAdvSetMacMtuWan of bin httpd in Tenda AC10V4.0 V16.03.10.20 allows remote attackers to cause...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67074</link><description>A Buffer overflow vulnerability in function fromAdvSetMacMtuWan of bin httpd in Tenda AC10V4.0 V16.03.10.20 allows remote attackers to cause denial of service and possibly code execution by sending a post request with a crafted payload (field `serverName`) to /goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:37:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66396 | ChurchCRM has SQL Injection in User Editor via `type` Parameter Key</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66396</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `src/UserEditor.php` file. When an administrator saves a user's configuration settings, the keys of the `type` POST parameter array are not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows a malicious or compromised administrator account to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks, to directly interact with the database. The vulnerability is located in `src/UserEditor.php` within the logic that handles saving user-specific configuration settings. The `type` parameter from the POST request is processed as an array. The code iterates through this array and uses `key($type)` to extract the array key, which is expected to be a numeric ID. This key is then assigned to the `$id` variable. The `$id` variable is subsequently concatenated directly into a `SELECT` and an `UPDATE` SQL query without any sanitization or validation, making it an injection vector. Although the vulnerability requires administrator privileges to exploit, it allows a malicious or compromised admin account to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can be used to bypass any application-level logging or restrictions, directly manipulate the database, exfiltrate, modify, or delete all data (including other user credentials, financial records, and personal information), and could potentially lead to further system compromise, such as writing files to the server, depending on the database's configuration and user privileges. Version 6.5.3 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:23:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66397 | ChurchCRM&amp;#x27;s Kiosk Manager Functions are vulnerable to Broken Access Control</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66397</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system.

Prior to version 5.21.0, a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in ChurchCRM's setup wizard allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code during the initial installation process, leading to complete server compromise. The vulnerability exists in `setup/routes/setup.php` where user input from the setup form is directly concatenated into a PHP configuration template without any validation or sanitization. Any parameter in the setup form can be used to inject PHP code that gets written to `Include/Config.php`, which is then executed on every page load. This is more severe than typical authenticated RCE vulnerabilities because it requires no credentials and affects the installation process that administrators must complete. Version 5.21.0 patches the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:23:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66395 | SQL Injection in Event List via `WhichType` Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-66395</link><description>ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `src/ListEvents.php` file. When filtering events by type, the `WhichType` POST parameter is not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks. Any authenticated user, regardless of their privilege level, can execute arbitrary queries on the database. This could allow them to exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data in the database, including user credentials, financial data, and personal information, leading to a full compromise of the application's data. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:23:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-46062 | Miniconda3 macOS installers before 23.11.0-1 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability when installed outside the user's home direc...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46062</link><description>Miniconda3 macOS installers before 23.11.0-1 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability when installed outside the user's home directory.

This issue affects Apache Airflow Providers Edge3: before 2.0.0 - and only if you installed and configured it on Airflow 2.



The Edge3 provider support in Airflow 2 has been always development-only and not officially released, however if you installed and configured Edge3 provider in Airflow 2, it implicitly enabled non-public (normally) API which was used to test Edge Provider in Airflow 2 during the development. This API allowed Dag author to perform Remote Code Execution in the webserver context, which Dag Author was not supposed to be able to do.

If you installed and configured Edge3 provider for Airflow 2, you should uninstall it and migrate to Airflow 3. The new Edge3 provider versions (&gt;=2.0.0) has minimum version of Airflow set to 3 and the RCE-prone Airflow 2 code is removed, so it should no longer be possible to use the Edge3 provider 2.0.0+ on Airflow 2.

If you used Edge Provider in Airflow 3, you are not affected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:54:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14101 | IDOR in GG Soft&amp;#x27;s PaperWork</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14101</link><description>Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in GG Soft Software Services Inc.
