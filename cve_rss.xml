In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 14:12:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-48714 | Record titles for restricted records can be viewed if exposed by GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48714</link><description>Silverstripe Framework is the framework that forms the base of the Silverstripe content management system. Prior to versions 4.13.39 and 5.1.11, if a user should not be able to see a record, but that record can be added to a `GridField` using the `GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter` component, the record's title can be accessed by that user. Versions 4.13.39 and 5.1.11 contain a fix for this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 13:58:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0741 | An out of bounds write in ANGLE could have allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0 prior to 5.1.3, `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page. Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and 5.1.3 by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in the query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly. One may disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 13:21:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0703 | The Sticky Buttons – floating buttons builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sticky URLs in all versi...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0703</link><description>The Sticky Buttons – floating buttons builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via sticky URLs in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 11:11:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22076

Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 23:20:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23339 | hoolock does not block Prototype pollution with object-path related utilities</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23339</link><description>hoolock is a suite of lightweight utilities designed to maintain a small footprint when bundled.
