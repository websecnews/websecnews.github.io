Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages that appear to originate from the Postfix server, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Postfix supports &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; but some other popular e-mail servers do not. To prevent attack variants (by always disallowing &lt;LF&gt; without &lt;CR&gt;), a different solution is required: the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option with a Postfix minimum version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 05:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51763 | csv_builder.rb in ActiveAdmin (aka Active Admin) before 3.2.0 allows CSV injection.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51763</link><description>csv_builder.rb in ActiveAdmin (aka Active Admin) before 3.2.0 allows CSV injection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 03:28:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-7090 | Sudo: improper handling of ipa_hostname leads to privilege mismanagement</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7090</link><description>A flaw was found in sudo in the handling of ipa_hostname, where ipa_hostname from /etc/sssd/sssd.conf was not propagated in sudo.

Versions of `gradio` prior to 4.11.0 contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. This issue has been patched in version 4.11.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 21:16:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51451 | SSRF in symbolicator via invalid protocol</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51451</link><description>Symbolicator is a service used in Sentry. Starting in Symbolicator version 0.3.3 and prior to version 21.12.1, an attacker could make Symbolicator send GET HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs with internal IP addresses by using an invalid protocol. The responses of those requests could be exposed via Symbolicator's API. In affected Sentry instances, the data could be exposed through the Sentry API and user interface if the attacker has a registered account. The issue has been fixed in Symbolicator release 23.12.1, Sentry self-hosted release 23.12.1, and has already been mitigated on sentry.io on December 18, 2023. If updating is not possible, some other mitigations are available. One may disable JS processing by toggling the option `Allow JavaScript Source Fetching` in `Organization Settings &gt; Security &amp; Privacy` and/or disable all untrusted public repositories under `Project Settings &gt; Debug Files`. Alternatively, if JavaScript and native symbolication are not required, disable Symbolicator completely in `config.yml`.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 21:16:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51651 | Potential URI resolution path traversal in the AWS SDK for PHP</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51651</link><description>AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit for PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the RestSerializer component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been patched in version 3.288.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 21:16:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-51650 | Unauthorized access vulnerability on three interfaces</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51650</link><description>Hertzbeat is an open source, real-time monitoring system.

Hertzbeat uses aviatorscript to evaluate alert expressions. The alert expressions are supposed to be some simple expressions. However, due to improper sanitization for alert expressions in version prior to 1.4.1, a malicious user can use a crafted alert expression to execute any command on hertzbeat server. A malicious user who has access to alert define function can execute any command in hertzbeat instance. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 20:59:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50731 | MindsDB has arbitrary file write in file.py</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50731</link><description>MindsDB is a SQL Server for artificial intelligence. Prior to version 23.11.4.1, the `put` method in `mindsdb/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py` does not validate the user-controlled name value, which is used in a temporary file name, which is afterwards opened for writing on lines 122-125, which leads to path injection. Later in the method, the temporary directory is deleted on line 151, but since we can write outside of the directory using the path injection vulnerability, the potentially dangerous file is not deleted. Arbitrary file contents can be written due to `f.write(chunk)` on line 125. Mindsdb does check later on line 149 in the `save_file` method in `file-controller.py` which calls the `_handle_source` method in `file_handler.py` if a file is of one of the types `csv`, `json`, `parquet`, `xls`, or `xlsx`. However, since the check happens after the file has already been written, the files will still exist (and will not be removed due to the path injection described earlier), just the `_handle_source` method will return an error. The same user-controlled source source is used also in another path injection sink on line 138. This leads to another path injection, which allows an attacker to delete any `zip` or `tar.gz` files on the server.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 20:49:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50730 | Grackle has StackOverflowError in GraphQL query processing</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50730</link><description>Grackle is a GraphQL server written in functional Scala, built on the Typelevel stack. The GraphQL specification requires that GraphQL fragments must not form cycles, either directly or indirectly. Prior to Grackle version 0.18.0, that requirement wasn't checked, and queries with cyclic fragments would have been accepted for type checking and compilation. The attempted compilation of such fragments would result in a JVM `StackOverflowError` being thrown. Some knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be required to construct such a query, however no knowledge of any application-specific performance or other behavioural characteristics would be needed.

Grackle uses the cats-parse library for parsing GraphQL queries. Prior to version 0.18.0, Grackle made use of the cats-parse `recursive` operator. However, `recursive` is not currently stack safe. `recursive` was used in three places in the parser: nested selection sets, nested input values (lists and objects), and nested list type declarations. Consequently, queries with deeply nested selection sets, input values or list types could be constructed which exploited this, causing a JVM `StackOverflowException` to be thrown during parsing. Because this happens very early in query processing, no specific knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be required to construct such a query.

The possibility of small queries resulting in stack overflow is a potential denial of service vulnerability. This potentially affects all applications using Grackle which have untrusted users. Both stack overflow issues have been resolved in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle. As a workaround, users could interpose a sanitizing layer in between untrusted input and Grackle query processing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 20:49:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50924 | Stored XSS in Overview and Output fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50924</link><description>Englesystem is a shift planning system for chaos events. Engelsystem prior to v3.4.1 performed insufficient validation of user supplied data for the DECT number, mobile number, and work-log comment fields. The values of those fields would be displayed in corresponding log overviews, allowing the injection and execution of Javascript code in another user's context. This vulnerability enables an authenticated user to inject Javascript into other user's sessions. The injected JS will be executed during normal usage of the system when viewing, e.g., overview pages. This issue has been fixed in version 3.4.1.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 20:49:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-50727 | Resque vulnerable to reflected XSS in Queue Endpoint</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50727</link><description>Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing them on multiple queues, and processing them later.

To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration&gt;Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://&lt;HOST&gt;/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 16:21:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-42017 | IBM Planning Analytics file upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42017</link><description>IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 could allow a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files, caused by the improper validation of file extensions.
