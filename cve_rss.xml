vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal

vsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the
TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal
pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and
it is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's
common for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is
successful the socket will be added to the connected table a second
time, corrupting the list.

Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received
while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in
the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will
prevent list corruption from a double add.

Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e ("vsock: correct
removal of socket from the list"), which is in all current stable trees
except 4.9.y.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48787 | iwlwifi: fix use-after-free</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48787</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iwlwifi: fix use-after-free

If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the
firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling
device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in
iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However
the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it
was freed.

Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data
was already freed anyway.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48788 | nvme-rdma: fix possible use-after-free in transport error_recovery work</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48788</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: fix a possible use-after-free in controller reset during load

Unlike .queue_rq, in .submit_async_event drivers may not check the ctrl
readiness for AER submission. This may lead to a use-after-free
condition that was observed with nvme-tcp.

The race condition may happen in the following scenario:
1. driver executes its reset_ctrl_work
2. -&gt; nvme_stop_ctrl - flushes ctrl async_event_work
3. ctrl sends AEN which is received by the host, which in turn
   schedules AEN handling
4. teardown admin queue (which releases the queue socket)
5. AEN processed, submits another AER, calling the driver to submit
6. driver attempts to send the cmd
==&gt; use-after-free

In order to fix that, add ctrl state check to validate the ctrl
is actually able to accept the AER submission.

This addresses the above race in controller resets because the driver
during teardown should:
1. change ctrl state to RESETTING
2. flush async_event_work (as well as other async work elements)

So after 1,2, any other AER command will find the
ctrl state to be RESETTING and bail out without submitting the AER.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48791 | scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_task</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48791</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_task

Currently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before we
handle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due to
timeout.

When the timeout occurs, the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and the
sas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().

However, if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion still
thinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb-&gt;task
if the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if this
pointer is cleared.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48792 | scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48792</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task

Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper
layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or
mpi_sata_completion().

In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/O
completions:

 - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of
   the I/O.

 - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in
   pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,
we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the
pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48793 | KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48793</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration

Turns out that due to review feedback and/or rebases
I accidentally moved the call to nested_svm_load_cr3 to be too early,
before the NPT is enabled, which is very wrong to do.

KVM can't even access guest memory at that point as nested NPT
is needed for that, and of course it won't initialize the walk_mmu,
which is main issue the patch was addressing.

Fix this for real.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48794 | net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb&amp;#x27;s</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48794</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb's

Upon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only
ieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leak
the skb structure.

Free the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.

As the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of a
possible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and a
new interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just for
this purpose.

There is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on this
area and the issue kind of always existed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:47:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47622 | scsi: ufs: Fix a deadlock in the error handler</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47622</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sunrpc: fix reference count leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change

The refcount leak issues take place in an error handling path. When the
3rd argument buf doesn't match with "offline", "online" or "remove", the

count of a rpc_xprt object and a rpc_xprt_switch object increased by
rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt() and
rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch(), causing reference count leaks of
both unused objects.

cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction

My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where
the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced
below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already
runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some
interfaces as nl_owner_dead.

The race happens because we have two loops here - first we
dev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we
also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)
then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,
and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try
to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.

Fix this by only iterating once.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 11:26:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-48785 | ipv6: mcast: use rcu-safe version of ipv6_get_lladdr()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-48785</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: use rcu-safe version of ipv6_get_lladdr()

Some time ago 8965779d2c0e ("ipv6,mcast: always hold idev-&gt;lock before mca_lock")
switched ipv6_get_lladdr() to __ipv6_get_lladdr(), which is rcu-unsafe
version. That was OK, because idev-&gt;lock was held for these codepaths.

In 88e2ca308094 ("mld: convert ifmcaddr6 to RCU") these external locks were
removed, so we probably need to restore the original rcu-safe call.

Otherwise, we occasionally get a machine crashed/stalled with the following

As analyzed by Khazhy Kumykov, the cause of this bug is a race between
read_descriptors() and hub_port_init(): The first routine uses a field
in udev-&gt;descriptor, not expecting it to change, while the second
overwrites it.

Prior to commit 45bf39f8df7f ("USB: core: Don't hold device lock while
reading the "descriptors" sysfs file") this race couldn't occur,
because the routines were mutually exclusive thanks to the device
locking.  Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it to
the race.

The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changing
udev-&gt;descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.
Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;
we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change should
have been made long ago.

So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying a
buffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev has
not yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and then
hub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)
This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.

The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they really
are, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoid
writing to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has been
initialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that reads
the BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch later
on.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 09:55:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6579 | Web and WooCommerce Addons for WPBakery Builder &amp;lt;= 1.4.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Plugin Settings Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6579</link><description>The Web and WooCommerce Addons for WPBakery Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin settings modification due to a missing capability check on several plugin functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5.

Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 09:24:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1937 | Brizy – Page Builder &amp;lt;= 2.4.44 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Post Modification</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1937</link><description>The Brizy – Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'update_item' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.44.

drm/amdgpu: change vm-&gt;task_info handling

This patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm-&gt;task_info object.
The major changes are:
- vm-&gt;task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is
  reference counted.
- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management
    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before
      returning this info
    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info
- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.

This patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage
of vm-&gt;task_info.

This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage. Since no data will be written, so this is a low-impact vulnerability.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  Such parameters will be blocked.</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 07:50:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-4780 | Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon &amp;lt;= 1.4.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via eihe_link Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4780</link><description>The Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘eihe_link’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:38:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36432 | An arbitrary memory write vulnerability was discovered in Supermicro X11DPG-HGX2, X11PDG-QT, X11PDG-OT, and X11PDG-SN motherboards with BIOS...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36432</link><description>An arbitrary memory write vulnerability was discovered in Supermicro X11DPG-HGX2, X11PDG-QT, X11PDG-OT, and X11PDG-SN motherboards with BIOS firmware before 4.4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-36438 | eLinkSmart Hidden Smart Cabinet Lock 2024-05-22 has Incorrect Access Control and fails to perform an authorization check which can lead to c...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36438</link><description>eLinkSmart Hidden Smart Cabinet Lock 2024-05-22 has Incorrect Access Control and fails to perform an authorization check which can lead to card duplication and other attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-37016 | Mengshen Wireless Door Alarm M70 2024-05-24 allows Authentication Bypass via a Capture-Replay approach.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37016</link><description>Mengshen Wireless Door Alarm M70 2024-05-24 allows Authentication Bypass via a Capture-Replay approach.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 18:23:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39819 | Zoom Workplace Apps and SDK for Windows -

tcp: avoid too many retransmit packets

If a TCP socket is using TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, and the other peer
retracted its window to zero, tcp_retransmit_timer() can
retransmit a packet every two jiffies (2 ms for HZ=1000),
for about 4 minutes after TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has 'expired'.

The fix is to make sure tcp_rtx_probe0_timed_out() takes
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout into account.

Before blamed commit, the socket would not timeout after
icsk-&gt;icsk_user_timeout, but would use standard exponential
backoff for the retransmits.

Also worth noting that before commit e89688e3e978 ("net: tcp:
fix unexcepted socket die when snd_wnd is 0"), the issue
would last 2 minutes instead of 4.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32945 | LaTeX post content manipulation via renderer state leak across contexts</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32945</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to protect against abuse of a globally shared MathJax state which allows an attacker to change the contents of a LateX post, by creating another post with specific  macro definitions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-39767 | Spoofed push notifications from malicious server</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39767</link><description>Mattermost Mobile Apps versions &lt;=2.16.0 fail to validate that the push notifications received for a server actually came from this serve that which allows a malicious server to send push notifications with another server’s diagnostic ID or server URL and have them show up in mobile apps as that server’s push notifications.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 08:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6741 | Openfind Mail2000 - HttpOnly flag bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6741</link><description>Openfind's Mail2000 has a vulnerability that allows the HttpOnly flag to be bypassed.

SUNRPC: Fix UAF in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready()

After the listener svc_sock is freed, and before invoking svc_tcp_accept()
for the established child sock, there is a window that the newsock
retaining a freed listener svc_sock in sk_user_data which cloning from
parent. In the race window, if data is received on the newsock, we will
observe use-after-free report in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready().

Reproduce by two tasks:

1. while :; do rpc.nfsd 0 ; rpc.nfsd; done
2. while :; do echo "" | ncat -4 127.0.0.1 2049 ; done

Fix the UAF by simply doing nothing in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready()
if state != TCP_LISTEN, that will avoid dereferencing svsk for all
child socket.</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 07:20:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-6730 | Nanjing Xingyuantu Technology SparkShop uploadFile unrestricted upload</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6730</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Nanjing Xingyuantu Technology SparkShop up to 1.1.6.
