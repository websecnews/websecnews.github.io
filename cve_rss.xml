drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before executing GPINT commands

[Why]
DMCUB can be in idle when we attempt to interface with the HW through
the GPINT mailbox resulting in a system hang.

[How]
Add dc_wake_and_execute_gpint() to wrap the wake, execute, sleep
sequence.

If the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB will be put back into
sleep after the optional response is returned.

It functions similar to the inbox command interface.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52625 | drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52625</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface

[Why]
We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
powered on.

[How]
We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,
but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.

Fixing this issue involves the following:

1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start
   the process to exit idle or notify idle.

It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without
driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver
allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one
of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.

2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper
   that maintains this SW state.

This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the
DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit
idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.

3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or
   waiting for DMCUB idle.

This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping
DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52626 | net/mlx5e: Fix operation precedence bug in port timestamping napi_poll context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52626</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Indirection (*) is of lower precedence than postfix increment (++). Logic
in napi_poll context would cause an out-of-bound read by first increment
the pointer address by byte address space and then dereference the value.
Rather, the intended logic was to dereference first and then increment the
underlying value.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52627 | iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52627</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events

AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with
the ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying
user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit
registers or above the values set in high limit registers.
However, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callback
functions must be implemented and those were not present until now.
The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the
proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel
because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.

Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write
event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.

Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also move
those from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused
when support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:57:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26646 | thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26646</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM

The kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to the
hardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occurs
during boot and remains constant throughout runtime.

When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a second
memory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location as
part of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer may
differ from the one allocated by the image kernel.

When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFI
buffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if the
hardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from the
restore kernel).

It is also possible that the hardware "forgets" the address of the memory
buffer when resuming from "deep" suspend. Memory corruption may also occur
in such a scenario.

To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to
suspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.

Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of
non-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the
boot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during "deep" suspend
and hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.

platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe

p2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It
guards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel
rescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock
when PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan
locks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices
call p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.
Hence the deadlock.

To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().
Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()
for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),
refer the cache and return to the caller.

Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check
that its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH
specifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices
at the same DEVFN.

This is because flexbg_size is too large and the size of the new_group_data
array to be allocated exceeds MAX_ORDER. Currently, the minimum value of
MAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the corresponding
maximum number of groups that can be allocated is:

 (PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) ≈ 21845

And the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,
this value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups added
each time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multiple
times to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadata
in a flex_bg may be more dispersed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 17:22:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-52623 | SUNRPC: Fix a suspicious RCU usage warning</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52623</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 16:57:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2893 | Tenda AC7 SetOnlineDevName formSetDeviceName stack-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2893</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Tenda AC7 15.03.06.44 and classified as critical.

  BTRFS: error (device vdc: state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2055: errno=-2 No such entry

This happens because create_pending_snapshot() initializes the new root
item as a copy of the source root item. This includes the refs field,
which is 0 for a deleted subvolume. The call to btrfs_insert_root()
therefore inserts a root with refs == 0. btrfs_get_new_fs_root() then
finds the root and returns -ENOENT if refs == 0, which causes
create_pending_snapshot() to abort.

Fix it by checking the source root's refs before attempting the
snapshot, but after locking subvol_sem to avoid racing with deletion.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 15:26:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26645 | tracing: Ensure visibility when inserting an element into tracing_map</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26645</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The problem appears to be caused by CPU reordering of writes issued from
__tracing_map_insert().

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry-&gt;val);
 if (val &amp;&amp; keys_match(key, val-&gt;key, map-&gt;key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt-&gt;key, key, map-&gt;key_size);
 entry-&gt;val = elt;

The "memcpy(elt-&gt;key, key, map-&gt;key_size);" and "entry-&gt;val = elt;"
stores may become visible in the reversed order on another CPU. This
second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val-&gt;key and subse

This primarily affects users that combine an LLM (or agent) with the `XMLOutputParser` and expose the component via an endpoint on a web-service. 

This would allow a malicious party to attempt to manipulate the LLM to produce a malicious payload for the parser that would compromise the availability of the service.

A successful attack is predicated on:

1. Usage of XMLOutputParser
2. Passing of malicious input into the XMLOutputParser either directly or by trying to manipulate an LLM to do so on the users behalf
3.

This library may be used by the Azure IoT C SDK for communication between IoT Hub and IoT Hub devices. An attacker can cause an integer wraparound or under-allocation or heap buffer overflow due to vulnerabilities in parameter checking mechanism, by exploiting the buffer length parameter in Azure C SDK, which may lead to remote code execution. Requirements for RCE are 1. Compromised Azure account allowing malformed payloads to be sent to the device via IoT Hub service, 2. By passing IoT hub service max message payload limit of 128KB, and 3. Ability to overwrite code space with remote code.
