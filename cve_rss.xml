This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT commands.




Exploitation of the vulnerability gives full administrative (root) privileges to the attacker to execute any operating system command on TOBY-L2 which can lead to modification of the behavior of the module itself as well as the components connected with it (depending on its rights on other connected systems). It can further provide the ability to read system level files and hamper the availability of the module as well..




This issue affects TOBY-L2 series: TOBY-L200, TOBY-L201, TOBY-L210, TOBY-L220, TOBY-L280.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:08:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6977 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6977</link><description>This vulnerability enables malicious users to read sensitive files on the server.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:44:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6974 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6974</link><description>A malicious user could use this issue to access internal HTTP(s) servers and in the worst case (ie: aws instance) it could be abuse to get a remote code execution on the victim machine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6975 | Path Traversal: &amp;#x27;\..\filename&amp;#x27;</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6975</link><description>A malicious user could use this issue to get command execution on the vulnerable machine and get access to data &amp; models information.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6976 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6976</link><description>This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files into arbitrary locations on the remote filesystem in the context of the server process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 05:34:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-47703 | IBM Security Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47703</link><description>IBM Security Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager 4.3 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information when a detailed technical error message is returned in the browser.

When a client connects to a server using TLS, the server presents a certificate. This certificate links a public key to the identity of the service and is signed by a Certification Authority (CA), allowing the client to validate that the remote service can be trusted and is not malicious. If the client does not validate the parameters of the certificate, then attackers could be able to spoof the identity of the service. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using faking the identity of a RTU500 device and intercepting the messages initiated via the RTU500 Scripting interface.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 14:30:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-6931 | Out-of-bounds write in Linux kernel&amp;#x27;s Performance Events system component</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6931</link><description>A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
