Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:45:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20194 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20194</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform an injection attack against an affected device.

net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation

In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
I moved cp-&gt;hash calculation before the first
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp-&gt;alloc_hash is left untouched.
This difference could lead to another out of bound access.

cp-&gt;alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should
update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 13:24:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-33093 | IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-33093</link><description>IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.2.2 JWT secret is stored in public Helm Charts and is not stored as a Kubernetes secret.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 11:19:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4104 | Frontend Dashboard 1.0 - 2.2.6 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post Function</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4104</link><description>The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the fed_wp_ajax_fed_login_form_post() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.6.

During unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections.
This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-39361 | WordPress Royal Elementor Addons plugin &amp;lt;= 1.7.1017 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-39361</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in WProyal Royal Elementor Addons allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Royal Elementor Addons: from n/a through 1.7.1017.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:14:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20980 | Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20980</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn prior to Android 15 allows local attackers to cause memory corruption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20937 | Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20937</link><description>Out-of-bounds write in Keymaster trustlet prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to write out-of-bounds memory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20949 | Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privil...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20949</link><description>Path traversal vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 5.0.00.11 allows attackers to read and write arbitrary file with the privilege of Samsung Members.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20953 | Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20953</link><description>Improper access control in SmartManagerCN prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to launch activities within SmartManagerCN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 08:43:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20954 | Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitiv...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20954</link><description>Use of implicit intent for sensitive communication in EnrichedCall prior to SMR May-2025 Release 1 allows local attackers to access sensitive information.

Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 18:59:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46816 | goshs route not protected, allows command execution</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46816</link><description>goshs is a SimpleHTTPServer written in Go.

This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 17:30:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46736 | Umbraco Makes User Enumeration Feasible Based on Timing of Login Response</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46736</link><description>Umbraco is a free and open source .NET content management system.

In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 17:09:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-26262 | An issue in the component /internals/functions of R-fx Networks Linux Malware Detect v1.6.5 allows attackers to escalate privileges and exec...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26262</link><description>An issue in the component /internals/functions of R-fx Networks Linux Malware Detect v1.6.5 allows attackers to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code via supplying a file that contains a crafted filename.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 16:55:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45250 | MrDoc v0.95 and before is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the validate_url function of the app_doc/utils.py file.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45250</link><description>MrDoc v0.95 and before is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the validate_url function of the app_doc/utils.py file.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 16:55:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4041 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials Optigo Networks ONS NC600</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4041</link><description>In Optigo Networks ONS NC600 versions 4.2.1-084 through 4.7.2-330, an attacker could connect with the device's ssh server and utilize the system's components to perform OS command executions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 16:44:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-33770 | Real Estate Management System v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the message parameter at /contact.php.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33770</link><description>Real Estate Management System v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the message parameter at /contact.php.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 16:44:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22476 | Dell Storage Center - Dell Storage Manager, version(s) 20.1.20, contain(s) an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22476</link><description>Dell Storage Center - Dell Storage Manager, version(s) 20.1.20, contain(s) an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability.

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed.

The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the "specific" or the "reflect" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. ("generic" model is not impacted)

Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property "org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:31:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22886 | distributeddatamgr_udmf has a memory leak vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22886</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker case DOS through missing release of memory.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-25052 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has a buffer overflow vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25052</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker cause DOS through buffer overflow.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 09:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27132 | arkcompiler_ets_runtime has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27132</link><description>in OpenHarmony v5.0.3 and prior versions allow a local attacker arbitrary code execution in pre-installed apps through out-of-bounds write.

Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 01:15:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4303 | PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System add-phlebotomist.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4303</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System 1.0.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 20:00:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1909 | BuddyBoss Platform Pro &amp;lt;= 2.7.01 - Authentication Bypass via Apple OAuth provider</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1909</link><description>The BuddyBoss Platform Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.7.01.

Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 19:38:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46731 | Craft CMS Contains a Potential Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via Twig SSTI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46731</link><description>Craft is a content management system.

Prior to version 0.6.6, a vulnerability in the way certain html tags in chat messages are rendered allows attackers to inject JavaScript code into a chat transcript. The JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser every time that chat transcript is opened, allowing attackers to retrieve the user's access token and gain full control over their account. Chat transcripts can be shared with other users in the same server, or with the whole open-webui community if "Enable Community Sharing" is enabled in the admin panel. If this exploit is used against an admin user, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server where the open-webui backend is hosted. This can be done by creating a new function which contains malicious python code. This vulnerability also affects chat transcripts uploaded to `https://openwebui.com/c//`, allowing for wormable stored XSS in https[:]//openwebui[.]com. Version 0.6.6 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:57:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46720 | Keystone has an unintended `isFilterable` bypass that can be used as an oracle to match hidden fields</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46720</link><description>Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42212 | HCL BigFix Compliance is affected by an improper or missing SameSite attribute</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42212</link><description>HCL BigFix Compliance is affected by an improper or missing SameSite attribute.

Prior to version 0.6.6, low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id, which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's browser. Under the default settings, files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed by admins or themselves, limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file can be sent to an admin, and if clicked, will give the low-privileged user complete control over the admin's account, ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46340 | Misskey CSS Style Injection Vulnerability In `MkUrlPreview`</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46340</link><description>Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 18:50:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-46553 | @misskey-dev/summaly Redirect Filter Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-46553</link><description>@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page.

This configuration will sanitize SVG files uploaded using the media manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass this protection by uploading it with a permitted extension (for example, .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg extension. This vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user. This issue has been patched in v3.7.5.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:29:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-24977 | OpenCTI has remote code execution and sensitive secrets exposed through web hook</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24977</link><description>OpenCTI is an open cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform.

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) &gt; (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info-&gt;changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58100 | bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58100</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   --&gt;    bpf_prog_is_offloaded
      bpf_prog_is_offloaded           check_cfg
      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env-&gt;ops
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_btf_trace
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_name
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;attach_func_proto
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;dst_trampoline
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;mod
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_attach_type
- prog-&gt;aux-&gt;saved_dst_prog_type
- prog-&gt;expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58237 | bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58237</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers

Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate
packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call
invalidates packet pointers.

Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes
use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for
global sub-programs, such that the following program could be
rejected:

    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	bpf_tail_call_static(sk, &amp;amp;jmp_table, 0);
    	return 0;
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	int *p = (void *)(long)sk-&gt;data;
    	... make p valid ...
    	tail_call(sk);
    	*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */
    	...
    }

The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that
can invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with
tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:12:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-4316 | Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests eve...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4316</link><description>Improper access control in PAM feature in Devolutions Server 2025.1.6.0 and earlier allows a PAM user to self approve their PAM requests even if disallowed by the configured policy via specific user interface actions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 14:13:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45751 | SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullnam...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-45751</link><description>SourceCodester Web Based Pharmacy Product Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in add-admin.php via the Fullname text field.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 13:49:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-28168 | Outsystems Multiple File Upload &lt; 3.1.0 is vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload.
