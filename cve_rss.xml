sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled

David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:

  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220
   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180
   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250
   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

The corresponding interrupt flag trace:

  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90
  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90

That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further
instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec
jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the
NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked
cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:

  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60
  down_timeout+0x18/0x60
  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80
  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100
  acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60

  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0
  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240
  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with
the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the
scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and
invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler
enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above
warning at the end.

Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in
triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not
have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations
it's just a question of time.

The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling
models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and
the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into
account.

Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-58091 | drm/fbdev-dma: Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-58091</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/fbdev-dma: Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O

DMA areas are not necessarily backed by struct page, so we cannot
rely on it for deferred I/O. Allocate a shadow buffer for drivers
that require deferred I/O and use it as framebuffer memory.

Fixes driver errors about being "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address" or "Unable to handle kernel paging
request at virtual address".

The patch splits drm_fbdev_dma_driver_fbdev_probe() in an initial
allocation, which creates the DMA-backed buffer object, and a tail
that sets up the fbdev data structures. There is a tail function for
direct memory mappings and a tail function for deferred I/O with
the shadow buffer.

It is no longer possible to use deferred I/O without shadow buffer.
It can be re-added if there exists a reliably test for usable struct
page in the allocated DMA-backed buffer object.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21872 | efi: Don&amp;#x27;t map the entire mokvar table to determine its size</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21872</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: Don't map the entire mokvar table to determine its size

Currently, when validating the mokvar table, we (re)map the entire table
on each iteration of the loop, adding space as we discover new entries.
If the table grows over a certain size, this fails due to limitations of
early_memmap(), and we get a failure and traceback:

  mokvar: Failed to map EFI MOKvar config table pa=0x7c4c3000, size=265187.

Mapping the entire structure isn't actually necessary, as we don't ever
need more than one entry header mapped at once.

Changes efi_mokvar_table_init() to only map each entry header, not the
entire table, when determining the table size.  Since we're not mapping
any data past the variable name, it also changes the code to enforce
that each variable name is NUL terminated, rather than attempting to
verify it in place.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21873 | scsi: ufs: core: bsg: Fix crash when arpmb command fails</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21873</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-integrity: Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode

In Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero.

Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,
which should be done only if the journal is configured.

Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS.

This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to
compiler optimization.

On my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following:

Indeed the PM can try to send a RM_ADDR over a msk without acquiring
first the msk socket lock.

The bugged code-path comes from an early optimization: when there
are no subflows, the PM should (usually) not send RM_ADDR
notifications.

The above statement is incorrect, as without locks another process
could concur

iommu/vt-d: Fix suspicious RCU usage

Commit  ("iommu/vt-d: Allocate DMAR fault interrupts
locally") moved the call to enable_drhd_fault_handling() to a code
path that does not hold any lock while traversing the drhd list. Fix
it by ensuring the dmar_global_lock lock is held when traversing the
drhd list.

Without this fix, the following warning is triggered:

Holding the lock in enable_drhd_fault_handling() triggers a lockdep splat
about a possible deadlock between dmar_global_lock and cpu_hotplug_lock.
This is avoided by not holding dmar_global_lock when calling
iommu_device_register(), which initiates the device probe process.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21877 | usbnet: gl620a: fix endpoint checking in genelink_bind()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21877</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: gl620a: fix endpoint checking in genelink_bind()

Syzbot reports [1] a warning in usb_submit_urb() triggered by
inconsistencies between expected and actually present endpoints
in gl620a driver. Since genelink_bind() does not properly
verify whether specified eps are in fact provided by the device,
in this case, an artificially manufactured one, one may get a
mismatch.

Fix the issue by resorting to a usbnet utility function
usbnet_get_endpoints(), usually reserved for this very problem.
Check for endpoints and return early before proceeding further if
any are missing.

i2c: npcm: disable interrupt enable bit before devm_request_irq

The customer reports that there is a soft lockup issue related to
the i2c driver. After checking, the i2c module was doing a tx transfer
and the bmc machine reboots in the middle of the i2c transaction, the i2c
module keeps the status without being reset.

Due to such an i2c module status, the i2c irq handler keeps getting
triggered since the i2c irq handler is registered in the kernel booting
process after the bmc machine is doing a warm rebooting.
The continuous triggering is stopped by the soft lockup watchdog timer.

Disable the interrupt enable bit in the i2c module before calling
devm_request_irq to fix this issue since the i2c relative status bit
is read-only.

Here is the soft lockup log.

btrfs: fix use-after-free on inode when scanning root during em shrinking

At btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the inode's root (and fs_info) in a
call to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode for a delayed
iput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the
cleaner kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call
to btrfs_fs_closing().

Fix this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead
of doing inode-&gt;root-&gt;fs_info.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 15:13:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21880 | drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21880</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

already zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and
if the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.

However it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on
the rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the
pin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the
rebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and
this time hitting the EFAULT.

This explains an internal user report of hitting:

Followed by NPD, when running some workload, since the sg was never
actually populated but the vma is still marked for rebind when it should
be skipped for this special EFAULT case. This is confirmed to fix the
user report.

v2 (MattB):
 - Move earlier.
v3 (MattB):
 - Update the commit message to make it clear that this indeed fixes the

The cause is that zero pfn is set to the PTE without increasing the RSS
count in mfill_atomic_pte_zeropage() and the refcount of zero folio does
not increase accordingly. Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed
in uprobe_write_opcode()-&gt;__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the
RSS count and old_folio's refcount.

Therefore, two bugs are introduced:

 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report
    error "Bad rss-count".

 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio-&gt;refcount is zero,
    then free_pages_prepare-&gt;free_page_is_bad() report error
    "Bad page state".

There is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:

  __replace_page()
    -&gt; ...
      -&gt; folio_remove_rmap_pte()
        -&gt; VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)

Considering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just
reject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().

ice: Fix deinitializing VF in error path

If ice_ena_vfs() fails after calling ice_create_vf_entries(), it frees
all VFs without removing them from snapshot PF-VF mailbox list, leading
to list corruption.

net: better track kernel sockets lifetime

While kernel sockets are dismantled during pernet_operations-&gt;exit(),
their freeing can be delayed by any tx packets still held in qdisc
or device queues, due to skb_set_owner_w() prior calls.

This then trigger the following warning from ref_tracker_dir_exit() [1]

To fix this, make sure that kernel sockets own a reference on net-&gt;passive.

Add sk_net_refcnt_upgrade() helper, used whenever a kernel socket
is converted to a refcounted one.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix implicit ODP hang on parent deregistration

Fix the destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr() to prevent hanging during
parent deregistration as of below [1].

Upon entering destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr(), the reference count
for the implicit MR parent is incremented using:
refcount_inc_not_zero().

A corresponding decrement must be performed if
free_implicit_child_mr_work() is not called.

The code has been updated to properly manage the reference count that
was incremented.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a WARN during dereg_mr for DM type

Memory regions (MR) of type DM (device memory) do not have an associated
umem.

In the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() -&gt; mlx5_free_priv_descs() flow, the code
incorrectly takes the wrong branch, attempting to call
dma_unmap_single() on a DMA address that is not mapped.

This results in a WARN [1], as shown below.

The issue is resolved by properly accounting for the DM type and
ensuring the correct branch is selected in mlx5_free_priv_descs().

RDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP

This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP,
ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].

During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the
software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.

Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed
CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB
specification.

This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.

To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a
barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.

Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no
outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and
subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.

Note:
For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR.
Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive
IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't
care about its status.

Additionally, it could also result in other severe consequences given the application's implementation, such as identity confusion, where an attacker could impersonate an assistant or system role within conversations. This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak attacks when interacting with large language models (LLMs). Just like the Javascript's prototype pollution, this vulnerability could leave a way for attackers to manipulate the intended data-flow or control-flow of the application at runtime and lead to severe consequences like remote code execution when gadgets are available. Users should upgrade to version 0.14.1 to obtain a fix for the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:56:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1997 | IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) / IBM DevOps Deploy HTML injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1997</link><description>IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) 7.0 through 7.0.5.25, 7.1 through 7.1.2.21, 7.2 through 7.2.3.14, and 7.3 through 7.3.2.0 / IBM DevOps Deploy 8.0 through 8.0.1.4 and 8.1 through 8.1 could allow unauthorized access to other services or potential exposure of sensitive data due to missing authentication in its Agent Relay service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:49:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-1998 | IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) / IBM DevOps Deploy information disclosure</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1998</link><description>IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) through 7.1.2.21, 7.2 through 7.2.3.14, and 7.3 through 7.3.2.0 / IBM DevOps Deploy 8.0 through 8.0.1.4 and 8.1 through 8.1

bpf, test_run: Fix use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()

KMSAN reported a use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()[1]. The
cause of the issue was that eth_skb_pkt_type() accessed skb's data
that didn't contain an Ethernet header. This occurs when
bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() passes an invalid value as the user_data
argument to bpf_test_init().

Fix this by returning an error when user_data is less than ETH_HLEN in
bpf_test_init(). Additionally, remove the check for "if (user_size &gt;
size)" as it is unnecessary.

on kernel built with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45, where SKB_WITH_OVERHEAD(1024)
is smaller than GRO_MAX_HEAD.

Such built additionally contains the revert of the single page frag cache
so that napi_get_frags() ends up using the page frag allocator, triggering
the splat.

Note that the underlying issue is independent from the mentioned
revert; address it ensuring that the small head cache will fit either TCP
and GRO allocation and updating napi_alloc_skb() and __netdev_alloc_skb()
to select kmalloc() usage for any allocation fitting such cache.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21869 | powerpc/code-patching: Disable KASAN report during patching via temporary mm</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21869</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Commit c28c15b6d28a ("powerpc/code-patching: Use temporary mm for
Radix MMU") is inspired from x86 but unlike x86 is doesn't disable
KASAN reports during patching. This wasn't a problem at the begining
because __patch_mem() is not instrumented.

Commit 465cabc97b42 ("powerpc/code-patching: introduce
patch_instructions()") use copy_to_kernel_nofault() to copy several
instructions at once. But when using temporary mm the destination is
not regular kernel memory but a kind of kernel-like memory located
in user address space.

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Other, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as
the ALH copier and in that case the copier-&gt;data is NULL, no alh_data is
attached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.
We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()
and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()
will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.

The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the
1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w-&gt;private is valid
2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-21871 | tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop

OP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it
be hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an OP-TEE
RPC call. It becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdown
ordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the
client application.

Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client
getting hung in an unkillable state. It in turn lead to system being in
hung up state requiring hard power off/on to recover.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2849 | UPX p_lx_elf.cpp un_DT_INIT heap-based overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2849</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in UPX up to 5.0.0.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.11.5 and 2.12.13 allows an attacker to craft a request that, once transmitted to a victim's Icinga Web, allows to embed arbitrary Javascript into it and to act on behalf of that user. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.11.5 and 2.12.3 of Icinga Web 2. As a workaround, those who have Icinga Web 2.12.2 may enable a content security policy in the application settings. Any modern browser with a working CORS implementation also sufficiently guards against the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:25:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30164 | Icinga Web 2 has open redirect on login page</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30164</link><description>Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface.

The patch in versions `3.3.4` and `3.4.0.beta5` uses the `lock` step in service to wrap part of the `add_users_to_channel` service inside a distributed lock/mutex in order to avoid the race condition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:20:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2022-39163 | IBM Cognos Controller HTTP response smuggling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39163</link><description>IBM Cognos Controller 11.0.0 through 11.1.0 is vulnerable to a Client-Side Desync (CSD) attack where an attacker could exploit a desynchronized browser connection that could lead to further cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-23203 | Icinga has rest API endpoints accessible to restricted users</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23203</link><description>Icinga Director is an Icinga config deployment tool. A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query; icingaweb2/directore/notification; icingaweb2/director/serviceset; and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it.  This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1. If upgrading is not feasible, disable the director module for the users other than admin role for the time being.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:53:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45351 | Game center application has code execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45351</link><description>A code execution vulnerability exists in the Xiaomi Game center application product.

Versions 1.7.2 through 2.1.1 are vulnerable to potential environment variable exposure on Windows with CMD. This impact users of Shescape on Windows that explicitly configure `shell: 'cmd.exe'` or `shell: true` using any of `quote`/`quoteAll`/`escape`/`escapeAll`. An attacker may be able to get read-only access to environment variables. This bug has been patched in v2.1.2. For those who are already using v2 of Shescape, no further changes are required. Those who are are using v1 of Shescape should follow the migration guide to upgrade to v2. There is no plan to release a patch compatible with v1 of Shescape. As a workaround, users can remove all instances of `%` from user input before using Shescape.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 23:13:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-30219 | RabbitMQ has XSS Vulnerability in an Error Message in Management UI</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30219</link><description>RabbitMQ is a messaging and streaming broker. Versions prior to 4.0.3 are vulnerable to a sophisticated attack that could modify virtual host name on disk and then make it unrecoverable (with other on disk file modifications) can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the browsers of management UI users. When a virtual host on a RabbitMQ node fails to start, recent versions
will display an error message (a notification) in the management UI. The error message includes virtual host name, which was not escaped prior to open source RabbitMQ 4.0.3 and Tanzu RabbitMQ 4.0.3, 3.13.8. An attack that both makes a virtual host fail to start and creates a new virtual host name with an XSS code snippet or changes the name of an existing virtual host on disk could trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the management UI (the user's browser). Open source RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and Tanzu RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and `3.13.8` patch the issue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 23:13:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27837 | An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 10.05.0.

In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability.
