perf: Fix event leak upon exec and file release

The perf pending task work is never waited upon the matching event
release. In the case of a child event, released via free_event()
directly, this can potentially result in a leaked event, such as in the
following scenario that doesn't even require a weak IRQ work
implementation to trigger:

schedule()
   prepare_task_switch()
=======&gt; 
      perf_event_overflow()
         event-&gt;pending_sigtrap = ...
         irq_work_queue(&amp;amp;event-&gt;pending_irq)
&lt;======= 
      perf_event_task_sched_out()
          event_sched_out()
              event-&gt;pending_sigtrap = 0;
              atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&amp;amp;event-&gt;refcount)
              task_work_add(&amp;amp;event-&gt;pending_task)
   finish_lock_switch()
=======&gt; 
   perf_pending_irq()
      //do nothing, rely on pending task work
&lt;======= 

begin_new_exec()
   perf_event_exit_task()
      perf_event_exit_event()
         // If is child event
         free_event()
            WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&amp;amp;event-&gt;refcount, 1, 0) != 1)
            // event is leaked

Similar scenarios can also happen with perf_event_remove_on_exec() or
simply against concurrent perf_event_release().

Fix this with synchonizing against the possibly remaining pending task
work while freeing the event, just like is done with remaining pending
IRQ work. This means that the pending task callback neither need nor
should hold a reference to the event, preventing it from ever beeing
freed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43870 | perf: Fix event leak upon exit</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43870</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix event leak upon exit

When a task is scheduled out, pending sigtrap deliveries are deferred
to the target task upon resume to userspace via task_work.

However failures while adding an event's callback to the task_work
engine are ignored. And since the last call for events exit happen
after task work is eventually closed, there is a small window during
which pending sigtrap can be queued though ignored, leaking the event
refcount addition such as in the following scenario:

    TASK A
    -----

    do_exit()
       exit_task_work(tsk);

       
       perf_event_overflow()
          event-&gt;pending_sigtrap = pending_id;
          irq_work_queue(&amp;amp;event-&gt;pending_irq);
       
    =========&gt; PREEMPTION: TASK A -&gt; TASK B
       event_sched_out()
          event-&gt;pending_sigtrap = 0;
          atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&amp;amp;event-&gt;refcount)
          // FAILS: task work has exited
          task_work_add(&amp;amp;event-&gt;pending_task)
       [...]
       
       perf_pending_irq()
          // early return: event-&gt;oncpu = -1
       
       [...]
    =========&gt; TASK B -&gt; TASK A
       perf_event_exit_task(tsk)
          perf_event_exit_event()
             free_event()
                WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&amp;amp;event-&gt;refcount, 1, 0) != 1)
                // leak event due to unexpected refcount == 2

As a result the event is never released while the task exits.

Fix this with appropriate task_work_add()'s error handling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43871 | devres: Fix memory leakage caused by driver API devm_free_percpu()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43871</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allow

There are two issues around seqpacket_allow:
1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is
   created. Thus if features are never set, it will be
   read uninitialized.
2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,
   then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately
   (existing apps I know about don't usually do this but
    it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies
    on this).

To fix:
	- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation
	- set it unconditionally in set_features</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43874 | crypto: ccp - Fix null pointer dereference in __sev_snp_shutdown_locked</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43874</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: Clean up error handling in vpci_scan_bus()

Smatch complains about inconsistent NULL checking in vpci_scan_bus():

    drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-vntb.c:1024 vpci_scan_bus() error: we previously assumed 'vpci_bus' could be null (see line 1021)

Instead of printing an error message and then crashing we should return
an error code and clean up.

Also the NULL check is reversed so it prints an error for success
instead of failure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43876 | PCI: rcar: Demote WARN() to dev_warn_ratelimited() in rcar_pcie_wakeup()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43876</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: rcar: Demote WARN() to dev_warn_ratelimited() in rcar_pcie_wakeup()

Avoid large backtrace, it is sufficient to warn the user that there has
been a link problem. Either the link has failed and the system is in need
of maintenance, or the link continues to work and user has been informed.
The message from the warning can be looked up in the sources.

This makes an actual link issue less verbose.

First of all, this controller has a limitation in that the controller
driver has to assist the hardware with transition to L1 link state by
writing L1IATN to PMCTRL register, the L1 and L0 link state switching
is not fully automatic on this controller.

In case of an ASMedia ASM1062 PCIe SATA controller which does not support
ASPM, on entry to suspend or during platform pm_test, the SATA controller
enters D3hot state and the link enters L1 state. If the SATA controller
wakes up before rcar_pcie_wakeup() was called and returns to D0, the link
returns to L0 before the controller driver even started its transition to
L1 link state. At this point, the SATA controller did send an PM_ENTER_L1
DLLP to the PCIe controller and the PCIe controller received it, and the
PCIe controller did set PMSR PMEL1RX bit.

Once rcar_pcie_wakeup() is called, if the link is already back in L0 state
and PMEL1RX bit is set, the controller driver has no way to determine if
it should perform the link transition to L1 state, or treat the link as if
it is in L0 state. Currently the driver attempts to perform the transition
to L1 link state unconditionally, which in this specific case fails with a
PMSR L1FAEG poll timeout, however the link still works as it is already
back in L0 state.

Reduce this warning verbosity. In case the link is really broken, the
rcar_pcie_config_access() would fail, otherwise it will succeed and any
system with this controller and ASM1062 can suspend without generating
a backtrace.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43877 | media: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43877</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result

In case DMA fails, 'dma-&gt;SG_length' is 0. This value is later used to
access 'dma-&gt;SGarray[dma-&gt;SG_length - 1]', which will cause out of
bounds access.

Add check to return early on invalid value. Adjust warnings accordingly.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning

ACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM
(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can
contain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each
region (i.e., tc chain) is limited.

In order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device
allows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up
to 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using
dst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the
number of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask
aggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.

The driver uses the "objagg" library to perform the mask aggregation by
passing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the
filter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in
different TCAMs cannot share a mask.

The set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the
filters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will
periodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set ("hints") by
looking at all the existing objects.

When the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated
the driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /
C-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to
move as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids
two identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if
one was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the
A-TCAM.

The above can result in the following set of hints:

H1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -&gt; H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta
H3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -&gt; H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta

After getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating
filters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints
and instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during
the transition.

Assuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the
new region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of
H1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and
create it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)
will be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either
return H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison
function that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.

This can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by
the library [1].

Fix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and
the library as the driver was the only user. That way the lookup will
only return exact matches.

I do not have a reliable reproducer that can reproduce the issue in a
timely manner, but before the fix the issue would reproduce in several
minutes and with the fix it does not reproduce in over an hour.

Note that the current usefulness of the hints is limited because they
include the C-TCAM indication and represent aggregation that cannot
actually happen. This will be addressed in net-next.

wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets

For fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles each fragment as a normal
packet and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA
direction should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise,
an invalid payload may be reinjected into the HW and
subsequently delivered to the host.

Given that arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer,
knowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer is lacking.
Consequently, there’s a risk of private information being leaked.

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, "chmod o-x,u+s target" makes "target" executable only
by uid "root" and gid "cdrom", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group "cdrom" membership can
get the permission to execute "target" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of "only cdrom
group members can setuid to root".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:16:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43862 | net: wan: fsl_qmc_hdlc: Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43862</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
fix poll-&gt;fence wait-&gt;fence unref deadlocks.

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

Old bug, but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling
interfaces. Fix those, in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 23:57:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43864 | net/mlx5e: Fix CT entry update leaks of modify header context</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43864</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix CT entry update leaks of modify header context

The cited commit allocates a new modify header to replace the old
one when updating CT entry. But if failed to allocate a new one, eg.
exceed the max number firmware can support, modify header will be
an error pointer that will trigger a panic when deallocating it. And
the old modify header point is copied to old attr. When the old
attr is freed, the old modify header is lost.

Fix it by restoring the old attr to attr when failed to allocate a
new modify header context. So when the CT entry is freed, the right
modify header context will be freed. And the panic of accessing
error pointer is also fixed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 23:57:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43865 | s390/fpu: Re-add exception handling in load_fpu_state()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43865</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The web application inserts the access token of an authenticated user inside GET requests. The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks. Because the access token in sent in GET requests, this vulnerability could lead to complete account takeover.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 20:08:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-41659 | GHSL-2024-034: memos CORS Misconfiguration in server.go</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41659</link><description>memos is a privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service.

Before 4.0.7, there is a flaw in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented. Since the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.7.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:56:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-43380 | fugit parse and parse_nat stall on lengthy input</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43380</link><description>fugit contains time tools for flor and the floraison group.

Prior to v3.81.9, this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed. The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog v3.81.9 and later versions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 14:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25582 | Module savepoints could be abused to inject references to malicious code delivered through the same domain.
