Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29902 | Cosign vulnerable to system-wide denial of service via malicious attachments</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29902</link><description>Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30728 | An issue was discovered in the default configurations of ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30728</link><description>An issue was discovered in the default configurations of ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows unauthenticated attackers to gain access using default credentials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32001 | SpiceDB: LookupSubjects may return partial results if a specific kind of relation is used</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32001</link><description>SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data. Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder-&gt;view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:35:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31995 | zcap has incomplete expiration checks in capability chains.</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31995</link><description>`@digitalbazaar/zcap` provides JavaScript reference implementation for Authorization Capabilities. Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31999 | @fastify/secure-session: Reuse of destroyed secure session cookie</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31999</link><description>@festify/secure-session creates a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify. At the end of the request handling, it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that, the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests, it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session, but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code, when the session is deleted, it is marked for deletion. However, if an attacker could gain access to the cookie, they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may include a "last update" field in the session, and treat "old sessions" as expired.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31997 | XWiki Platform remote code execution from account through UIExtension parameters</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31997</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

This allows remote code execution and thereby impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.9-RC1.

Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, the HTML escaping of escaping tool that is used in XWiki doesn't escape `{`, which, when used in certain places, allows XWiki syntax injection and thereby remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9 RC1. Apart from upgrading, there is no generic workaround. However, replacing `$escapetool.html` by `$escapetool.xml` in XWiki documents fixes the vulnerability. In a standard XWiki installation, the maintainers are only aware of the document `Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate` that exposes this vulnerability, patching this document is thus a workaround. Any extension could expose this vulnerability and might thus require patching, too.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 20:53:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1481 | Freeipa: specially crafted http requests potentially lead to denial of service</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1481</link><description>A flaw was found in FreeIPA.

Starting in version 13.9-rc-1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, when the realtime editor is installed in XWiki, it allows arbitrary remote code execution with the interaction of an admin user with programming right. More precisely, by getting an admin user to either visit a crafted URL or to view an image with this URL that could be in a comment, the attacker can get the admin to execute arbitrary XWiki syntax including scripting macros with Groovy or Python code. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.9. As a workaround, one may update `RTFrontend.ConvertHTML` manually with the patch. This will, however, break some synchronization processes in the realtime editor, so upgrading should be the preferred way on installations where this editor is used.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 20:46:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31987 | XWiki Platform remote code execution from account via custom skins support</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31987</link><description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform.

sched/fair: Prevent dead task groups from regaining cfs_rq's

Kevin is reporting crashes which point to a use-after-free of a cfs_rq
in update_blocked_averages(). Initial debugging revealed that we've
live cfs_rq's (on_list=1) in an about to be kfree()'d task group in
free_fair_sched_group(). However, it was unclear how that can happen.

His kernel config happened to lead to a layout of struct sched_entity
that put the 'my_q' member directly into the middle of the object
which makes it incidentally overlap with SLUB's freelist pointer.
That, in combination with SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED's freelist pointer
mangling, leads to a reliable access violation in form of a #GP which
made the UAF fail fast.

Michal seems to have run into the same issue[1]. He already correctly
diagnosed that commit a7b359fc6a37 ("sched/fair: Correctly insert
cfs_rq's to list on unthrottle") is causing the preconditions for the
UAF to happen by re-adding cfs_rq's also to task groups that have no
more running tasks, i.e. also to dead ones. His analysis, however,
misses the real root cause and it cannot be seen from the crash
backtrace only, as the real offender is tg_unthrottle_up() getting
called via sched_cfs_period_timer() via the timer interrupt at an
inconvenient time.

When unregister_fair_sched_group() unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying
task group, it doesn't protect itself from getting interrupted. If the
timer interrupt triggers while we iterate over all CPUs or after
unregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but prior to unlinking the
task group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walk the list of
task groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them to the
dying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- be
kfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin
and Michal are seeing.

To fix this race, ensure the dying task group gets unlinked first.
However, simply switching the order of unregistering and unlinking the
task group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers might still see
it, as can be seen below:

Currently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte(), if we
bail out using "goto out_release_unlock;" in the cases where idx &gt;=
size, or !huge_pte_none(), the code will detect that new_pagecache_page

restore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation, and the following
call to remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h-&gt;resv_hugepages
causing a 100% reproducible leak.

We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding a page into the
pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true, to indicate that there is
no reservation to restore on the error path, and we need not call
restore_reserve_on_error().  Rename new_pagecache_page to
page_in_pagecache to make that clear.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:17:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47215 | net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix crash in RX resync flow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47215</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),
h-&gt;size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h-&gt;htable
pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since
the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed
hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called
on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.

Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid
empty hashtab when the allocation fails.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:17:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47219 | scsi: scsi_debug: Fix out-of-bound read in resp_report_tgtpgs()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47219</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling

Several problems exist with scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling:

 1) The allocation length field of the MODE SENSE(10) command is 16-bits,
    occupying bytes 7 and 8 of the CDB. With this command, access to mode
    pages larger than 255 bytes is thus possible. However, the CDB
    allocation length field is set by assigning len to byte 8 only, thus
    truncating buffer length larger than 255.

 2) If scsi_mode_sense() is called with len smaller than 8 with
    sdev-&gt;use_10_for_ms set, or smaller than 4 otherwise, the buffer length
    is increased to 8 and 4 respectively, and the buffer is zero filled
    with these increased values, thus corrupting the memory following the
    buffer.

Fix these 2 problems by using put_unaligned_be16() to set the allocation
length field of MODE SENSE(10) CDB and by returning an error when len is
too small.

Furthermore, if len is larger than 255B, always try MODE SENSE(10) first,
even if the device driver did not set sdev-&gt;use_10_for_ms. In case of
invalid opcode error for MODE SENSE(10), access to mode pages larger than
255 bytes are not retried using MODE SENSE(6). To avoid buffer length
overflows for the MODE_SENSE(10) case, check that len is smaller than 65535
bytes.

While at it, also fix the folowing:

 * Use get_unaligned_be16() to retrieve the mode data length and block
   descriptor length fields of the mode sense reply header instead of using
   an open coded calculation.

 * Fix the kdoc dbd argument explanation: the DBD bit stands for Disable
   Block Descriptor, which is the opposite of what the dbd argument
   description was.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47183 | scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47183</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference

If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well
known addresses, outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer
dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated "2878" log
messages.

The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS
requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set
the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the
expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is
stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may
auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up, the Abort completions
may reference an invalid structure.

Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due
to conditions where the link failed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47184 | i40e: Fix NULL ptr dereference on VSI filter sync</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47184</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

flush_to_ldisc to pop data in a loop until there is no more data left.
When the sender and workqueue running in different core, the sender sends
data fastly in full time which will result in workqueue doing work in loop
for a long time and occuring softlockup in flush_to_ldisc with kernel

arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Fix CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency

The entry/exit latency and minimum residency in state for the idle
states of MSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the
timings were written for CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param
was miscalculated (supposedly, while porting this from downstream);
Then, the power collapse states are setting PC on both the CPU
cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have different timings: in the
specific case of L2 the times are higher so these ones should be
taken into account instead of the CPU ones.

This parameter misconfiguration was not giving particular issues
because on MSM8998 there was no CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2
power collapse was rarely (if ever) hit.
When CPU scaling is enabled, though, the wrong timings will produce
SoC unstability shown to the user as random, apparently error-less,
sudden reboots and/or lockups.

This set of parameters are stabilizing the SoC when CPU scaling is
ON and when power collapse is frequently hit.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47188 | scsi: ufs: core: Improve SCSI abort handling</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47188</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions

Ordered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread
which executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between
normal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,
unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.

This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where
async_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes
submit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because
async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:

    pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0
    lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0
    sp : ffff800015d4bc20

    &lt;registers omitted for brevity&gt;

    Call trace:
     submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0

     ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18

Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all
accesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before
setting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of
WORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads
would be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures
are all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered
before any access that can occur in ordered_func.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47190 | perf bpf: Avoid memory leak from perf_env__insert_btf()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47190</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: sysfs: Fix hang when device state is set via sysfs

This fixes a regression added with:

commit f0f82e2476f6 ("scsi: core: Fix capacity set to zero after
offlinining device")

The problem is that after iSCSI recovery, iscsid will call into the kernel
to set the dev's state to running, and with that patch we now call
scsi_rescan_device() with the state_mutex held. If the SCSI error handler
thread is just starting to test the device in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() then it's
going to try to grab the state_mutex.

We are then stuck, because when scsi_rescan_device() tries to send its I/O
scsi_queue_rq() calls -&gt; scsi_host_queue_ready() -&gt; scsi_host_in_recovery()
which will return true (the host state is still in recovery) and I/O will
just be requeued. scsi_send_eh_cmnd() will then never be able to grab the
state_mutex to finish error handling.

To prevent the deadlock move the rescan-related code to after we drop the
state_mutex.

This also adds a check for if we are already in the running state. This
prevents extra scans and helps the iscsid case where if the transport class
has already onlined the device during its recovery process then we don't
need userspace to do it again plus possibly block that daemon.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47193 | scsi: pm80xx: Fix memory leak during rmmod</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47193</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi() routine

An error is detected with the following report when unloading the driver:
  "KASAN: use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi+0x1b1b"

The NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND nlp_flag is set in lpfc_reg_fab_ctrl_node(), but the

This allows a second call to lpfc_unreg_rpi() to proceed with nlp_rpi set

net/mlx5e: CT, Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts

CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the
flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which
hold ct_state.
When such flow also includes encap action, a neigh update event
can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.

Each time this happens, the ct clear handling adds that same set
of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr
actions is reached.

Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and
causing a memleak.

Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocation
into the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.
The release of mod acts will be done in the normal flow_put().

drm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. If

commit 9786b65bc61ac ("drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting"):
  "For that to work properly the drm_gem_object_get() call in

scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()

When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass
the requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local "fail_msg"
string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a
completions list for cancellation.

Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since
"fail_msg" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless
of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to
txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.

Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions
list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions
list unless they had an appropriate failure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47204 | net: dpaa2-eth: fix use-after-free in dpaa2_eth_remove</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47204</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding

Currently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, while
leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause
a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix
this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,
and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.

This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses the
correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.

Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited error
handling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting
is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:05:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2021-47206 | usb: host: ohci-tmio: check return value after calling platform_get_resource()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-47206</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, it is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they have rights to edit the users' page.  With the default right scheme in XWiki this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of those pages. There is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again, this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right).

Traccar versions 5.1 through 5.12 allow arbitrary files to be uploaded through the device image upload API. Attackers have full control over the file contents, full control over the directory where the file is stored, full control over the file extension, and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file, an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, XSS, DOS, etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default, allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges, allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default, as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:35:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31461 | Plane Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31461</link><description>Plane, an open-source project management tool, has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in versions prior to 0.17-dev.

x86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section

When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into
the .notes section so that Xen can find the "startup_xen" entry point.
This information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations
are not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notes
section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes
is world-readable.

To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that
are expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in
the .notes section. The values readable in .notes are then identical to
those found in System.map.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 14:11:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23080 | Joda Time v2.12.5 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormat::wordBased(Locale).</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23080</link><description>Joda Time v2.12.5 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormat::wordBased(Locale).</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:51:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31492 | An external control of file name or path vulnerability [CWE-73] in  FortiClientMac version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.10 and below install...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31492</link><description>An external control of file name or path vulnerability [CWE-73] in  FortiClientMac version 7.2.3 and below, version 7.0.10 and below installer may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via writing a malicious configuration file in /tmp before starting the installation process.</description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:38:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20772 | Adobe Media Encoder 2024 AI file parsing Stack based buffer overflow</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20772</link><description>Media Encoder versions 24.2.1, 23.6.4 and earlier are affected by a Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

In the Plugin System -&gt; Plugin Template feature, an attacker can perform directory traversal by manipulating the `plugName` parameter. They can create specific folders such as `api`, `config`, `global`, `model`, `router`, `service`, and `main.go` function within the specified traversal directory. Moreover, the Go files within these folders can have arbitrary code inserted based on a specific PoC parameter. The main reason for the existence of this vulnerability is the controllability of the PlugName field within the struct. Pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240409100909-b1b7427c6ea6, corresponding to commit b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b, contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may manually use a filtering method available in the GitHub Security Advisory to rectify the directory traversal problem.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:45:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25115 | RedisBloom heap buffer overflow in CF.LOADCHUNK command</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25115</link><description>RedisBloom adds a set of probabilistic data structures to Redis.

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.

The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.

On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.

One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.

Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an [`InvalidInput`][4] error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.

The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22423 | yt-dlp `--exec` command injection when using `%q` in yt-dlp on Windows</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22423</link><description>yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However, this escaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade, avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `"`, `|` or `&amp;`; and/or instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27242 | Zoom Desktop Client for Linux - Cross Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27242</link><description>Cross site scripting in Zoom Desktop Client for Linux before version 5.17.10 may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:31:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31454 | PsiTransfer file integrity violation vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31454</link><description>PsiTransfer is an open source, self-hosted file sharing solution.

generation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29905</link><description>DIRAC is an interware, meaning a software framework for distributed computing. Prior to version 8.0.41, during the proxy generation process (e.g., when using `dirac-proxy-init`), it is possible for unauthorized users on the same machine to gain read access to the proxy. This allows the user to then perform any action that is possible with the original proxy. This vulnerability only exists for a short period of time (sub-millsecond) during the generation process. Version 8.0.41 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, setting the `X509_USER_PROXY` environment variable to a path that is inside a directory that is only readable to the current user avoids the potential risk. After the file has been written, it can be safely copied to the standard location (`/tmp/x509up_uNNNN`).</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:58:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31455 | Minder GetRepositoryByName data leak</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31455</link><description>Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:58:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30262 | Contao&amp;#x27;s remember-me tokens will not be cleared after a password change</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30262</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable "Allow auto login" in the login module.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:50:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31867 | Apache Zeppelin: LDAP search filter query Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31867</link><description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Zeppelin.
