Prior to version 2.1.44, it is possible to inject malicious code into the HTML content of an email notification, which is then rendered on the preview. There is no issue when rendering the email via normal means (a delivered email). This would require access to the form's email notification settings. This has been fixed in Formie 2.1.44.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:47:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32427 | Formie has a XSS vulnerability for importing forms</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32427</link><description>Formie is a Craft CMS plugin for creating forms. Prior to 2.1.44, when importing a form from JSON, if the field label or handle contained malicious content, the output wasn't correctly escaped when viewing a preview of what was to be imported. As imports are undertaking primarily by users who have themselves exported the form from one environment to another, and would require direct manipulation of the JSON export, this is marked as moderate. This vulnerability will not occur unless someone deliberately tampers with the export. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.44.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:47:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13861 | A code injection vulnerability in the Debian package component of Taegis Endpoint Agent (Linux) versions older than 1.3.10 allows local user...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13861</link><description>A code injection vulnerability in the Debian package component of Taegis Endpoint Agent (Linux) versions older than 1.3.10 allows local users arbitrary code execution as root.

Your application may be affected by this if the following are true:
  *  You have Spring Vault on the classpath of your Spring Cloud Config Server and
  *  You are using the X-CONFIG-TOKENÂ header to send a Vault token to the Spring Cloud Config Server for the Config Server to use when making requests to Vault and
  *  You are using the default Spring Vault SessionManagerÂ implementation LifecycleAwareSessionManagerÂ or a SessionManagerÂ implementation that persists the Vault token such as SimpleSessionManager.

In this case the SessionManagerÂ persists the first token it retrieves and will continue to use that token even if client requests to the Spring Cloud Config Server include a X-CONFIG-TOKENÂ header with a different value.

When admins change Snowflake connection details in Metabase (either updating a password or changing password to private key or vice versa), Metabase would not always purge older Snowflake connection details from the application database. In order to remove older and stale connection details, Metabase would try one connection method at a time and purge all the other connection methods from the application database. When Metabase found a connection that worked, it would log (log/infof "Successfully connected, migrating to: %s" (pr-str test-details)) which would then print the username and password to the logger. This is fixed in 52.17.1, 53.9.5 and 54.1.5 in both the OSS and enterprise editions.

Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected.

Only instances with the local filesystem upload backend or special configurations, where the uploads are served from the same domain as HedgeDoc, are vulnerable. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.3. When upgrading to HedgeDoc 1.10.3 is not possible, instance owners could add the following headers for all routes under /uploads as a first-countermeasure: Content-Disposition: attachment and Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'.

allows an unauthenticated, network-based attackerÂ to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

A vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.  Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32381 | Denial of Service by abusing xgrammar unbounded cache in memory</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32381</link><description>XGrammar is an open-source library for efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation. Prior to 0.1.18, Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory. Since the cache is unbounded, a system making use of xgrammar can be abused to fill up a host's memory and case a denial of service. For example, sending many small requests to an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas would eventually cause this denial of service to occur. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.1.18.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:19:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32379 | XSS at ctx.redirect() function in Koajs</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32379</link><description>Koa is expressive middleware for Node.js using ES2017 async functions.

This vulnerability affects confidential client applications, including daemons, web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information such as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely. Service logs generated at the information level or credential descriptions containing local file paths with passwords, Base64 encoded values, or Client secret. Additionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded certificates or certificate paths with password credential descriptions are also affected if the certificates are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials are not usable due to their invalid or expired status. To mitigate this vulnerability, update to Microsoft.Identity.Web 3.8.2 or Microsoft.Identity.Abstractions 9.0.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:57:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32378 | Shopware&amp;#x27;s default newsletter opt-in settings allow for mass sign-up abuse</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-32378</link><description>Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform.
