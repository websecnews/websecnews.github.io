Before 0.42.0, gitoxide uses SHA-1 hash implementations without any collision detection, leaving it vulnerable to hash collision attacks. gitoxide uses the sha1_smol or sha1 crate, both of which implement standard SHA-1 without any mitigations for collision attacks. This means that two distinct Git objects with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity checks when used with gitoxide. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.42.0.</description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:46:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-27520 | BentoML Allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Insecure Deserialization</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27520</link><description>BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference.

On many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution string in the syntax $(&lt;command /&gt;). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks "Git &gt; Open Git Repository in Terminal" from the menu bar, then the injected command &lt;command /&gt; is run in the user's shell without the user's permission. This issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, jupyterlab-git opens the terminal and runs cd  through the shell to set the current directory. Doing so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.1.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 22:15:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3183 | projectworlds Online Doctor Appointment Booking System patientupdateprofile.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3183</link><description>A vulnerability has been found in projectworlds Online Doctor Appointment Booking System 1.0 and classified as critical.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 19:28:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31481 | GraphQL query operations security can be bypassed</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31481</link><description>API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs.

first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

proc: fix UAF in proc_get_inode()

Fix race between rmmod and /proc/XXX's inode instantiation.

The bug is that pde-&gt;proc_ops don't belong to /proc, it belongs to a

is a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.

use_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde-&gt;proc_ops
never changes so information necessary for inode instantiation can be
saved _before_ proc_register() in PDE itself and used later, avoiding
pde-&gt;proc_ops-&gt;...  dereference.

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae ("can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload-&gt;raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload-&gt;fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:32:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22004 | net: atm: fix use after free in lec_send()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22004</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh-&gt;nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh-&gt;rt6i_pcpu, resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-22006 | net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22006</link><description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. 
The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended.

In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation.

Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31479 | canonical/get-workflow-version-action can leak a partial GITHUB_TOKEN in exception output</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-31479</link><description>canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3129 | Access code - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2025-028</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3129</link><description>Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability in Drupal Access code allows Brute Force.This issue affects Access code: from 0.0.0 before 2.0.4.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3130 | Obfuscate - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2025-029</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3130</link><description>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Drupal Obfuscate allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Obfuscate: from 0.0.0 before 2.0.1.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:28:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-2704 | OpenVPN version 2.6.1 through 2.6.13 in server mode using TLS-crypt-v2 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service by corrupting ...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-2704</link><description>OpenVPN version 2.6.1 through 2.6.13 in server mode using TLS-crypt-v2 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service by corrupting and replaying network packets in the early handshake phase</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:13:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3118 | SourceCodester Online Tutor Portal view_course.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3118</link><description>A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Tutor Portal 1.0.

&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:37:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20139 | A vulnerability in chat messaging features of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20139</link><description>A vulnerability in chat messaging features of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to chat entry points. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a messaging chat entry point in the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. The application may not recover on its own and may need an administrator to manually restart services to recover.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:37:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-20203 | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure co...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-20203</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the interface of an affected system.
&#13; The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid VPN user credentials on the affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because a variable is not initialized when an SSL VPN session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted attributes while establishing an SSL VPN session with an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.
&#13; Note: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers without manual intervention.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:37:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56474 | IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms cross-site request forgery</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56474</link><description>IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms 9.1 and 11.1 is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery which could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:47:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-56475 | IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms cross-site scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56475</link><description>IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms 9.1 and 11.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

drm/amd/display: fix missing .is_two_pixels_per_container

Starting from 6.11, AMDGPU driver, while being loaded with amdgpu.dc=1,
due to lack of .is_two_pixels_per_container function in dce60_tg_funcs,
causes a NULL pointer dereference on PCs with old GPUs, such as R9 280X.

So this fix adds missing .is_two_pixels_per_container to dce60_tg_funcs.

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  "Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes."

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a "first CPU".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y
  index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]'
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   dump_stack
   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds
   load_microcode_amd
   request_microcode_amd
   reload_store
   kernfs_fop_write_iter
   vfs_write
   ksys_write
   do_syscall_64
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining
whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.

HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera

The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that
is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional
sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up
an unresponsive sensor.

When performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the

length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to 1/true on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny access to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true, such as registration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 02:53:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3066 | Use after free in Navigations in Google Chrome prior to 135.0.7049.52 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3066</link><description>Use after free in Navigations in Google Chrome prior to 135.0.7049.52 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.
