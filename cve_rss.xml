Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for
Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used
for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.

Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device
associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions
need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic
establishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in
such mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have been
removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memory
regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:38:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31146 | PCI device pass-through with shared resources</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31146</link><description>When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed
through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
missing.

Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but
are not limited to
- - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the
  same page (4k on x86),
- - INTx lines.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-45817 | x86: Deadlock in vlapic_error()</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45817</link><description>In x86's APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) architecture,
error conditions are reported in a status register.  Furthermore, the OS
can opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.

It is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,
which generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.

This case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().  The recursion
itself is bounded; errors accumulate in the the status register and only
generate an interrupt when a new status bit becomes set.

However, the lock protecting this state in Xen will try to be taken
recursively, and deadlock.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-9169 | litespeed cache &amp;lt;= 6.4.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9169</link><description>The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin debug settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "maintenance mode" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time. Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted user.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 07:10:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8290 | WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible &amp;lt;= 6.7.12 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8290</link><description>The WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.12 via the WCFM_Customers_Manage_Controller::processing function due to missing validation on the ID user controlled key.

Prior to version 0.41.0, if a user on macOS has granted Cursor access to the camera or microphone, any program that is run on the machine is able to access the camera or the microphone without explicitly being granted access, through a DyLib Injection using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. The usage of `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` allows an external dynamic library to be injected into the application using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. 
Moreover, the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` allows the application to use the host camera and `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` allows the application to use the microphone. This means that untrusted code that is executed on the user's machine can access the camera or the microphone, if the user has already given permission for Cursor to do so. In version 0.41.0, the entitlements have been split by process: the main process gets the camera and microphone entitlements, but not the DyLib entitlements, whereas the extension host process gets the DyLib entitlements but not the camera or microphone entitlements. As a workaround, do not explicitly give Cursor the permission to access the camera or microphone if untrusted users can run arbitrary commands on the affected machine.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26690 | File Upload vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via File Manager/Editor component in t...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26690</link><description>File Upload vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via File Manager/Editor component in the vendor or admin menu.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:58:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-26691 | Directory Traversal vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted zip file when inst...</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26691</link><description>Directory Traversal vulnerability in CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted zip file when installing a new add-on.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:58:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-42797 | An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability was found in /music/ajax.php?action=delete_playlist in Kashipara Music Management System v1.0.

Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allow authenticated attackers with 'Sys.Audit' or 'VM.Monitor' privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API.
When handling the result from a request handler before returning it to the user, the handle_api2_request function will check for the ‘download’ or ‘data’-&gt;’download’ objects inside the request handler call response object. If present, handle_api2_request will read a local file defined by this object and return it to the user.
Two endpoints were identified which can control the object returned by a request handler sufficiently that the ’download’ object is defined and user controlled. This results in arbitrary file read.
The privileges of this file read can result in full compromise of the system by various impacts such as disclosing sensitive files allowing for privileged session forgery.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 07:29:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-8103 | WP Category Dropdown &amp;lt;= 1.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via align Parameter</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8103</link><description>The WP Category Dropdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'align' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
