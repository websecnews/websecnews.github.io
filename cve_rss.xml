Ghostty, as allowed by default in 1.0.0, allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This attack requires an attacker to send malicious escape sequences followed by convincing the user to physically press the "enter" key. Fixed in Ghostty v1.0.1.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 23:00:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13085 | PHPGurukul Land Record System login.php sql injection</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13085</link><description>A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in PHPGurukul Land Record System 1.0.

This file contains sensitive credentials necessary for pulling images from private repositories. The mount is not read-only, which allows the attacker to overwrite it. By modifying the config.json file, the attacker can cause a denial of service by preventing the node from pulling new images and potentially exfiltrating sensitive secrets. This flaw impacts the availability of services dependent on image pulls and exposes sensitive information to unauthorized parties.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 02:56:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-13040 | Quanta Computer QOCA aim - Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13040</link><description>The QOCA aim from Quanta Computer has an Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability.
